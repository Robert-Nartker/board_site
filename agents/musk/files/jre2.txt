00:00:00.280 [Laughter]
00:00:05.920 [Music]
00:00:09.120 all day
00:00:16.400 no that's the uh sasha baron cohen movie
00:00:18.640 yeah i never saw that one there's a
00:00:20.080 scene where he's uh
00:00:24.000 they show him the new missile they've
00:00:25.279 developed and uh but it has kind of a
00:00:27.119 round
00:00:27.920 round head and he says uh you need to
00:00:30.880 make it more pointy
00:00:34.079 to his engineers and uh
00:00:38.239 actually that's what i also decided the
00:00:39.520 same thing um yeah
00:00:41.440 starship we need to make it more pointy
00:00:43.280 did you say that mm-hmm
00:00:44.719 because of the movie yeah really yeah
00:00:46.960 hold on
00:00:47.390 [Laughter]
00:00:49.920 i just have that main camera okay okay
00:00:53.920 that's you literally told them to make
00:00:56.320 the starship more pointy
00:00:58.079 because of the movie the dictator yep um
00:01:01.280 and they know it too it's not like they
00:01:02.879 it's not like they haven't they're
00:01:04.239 unaware of
00:01:05.040 it everyone thought it'd be funny if we
00:01:06.799 made the rocket more pointy so we did
00:01:08.960 did it have any effect on the
00:01:10.000 aerodynamics no nothing no we can make
00:01:12.400 it
00:01:12.720 way blunter and be fine but was is it
00:01:14.799 better to be pointier like if it wasn't
00:01:16.640 for this
00:01:17.119 arguably slightly worse but like
00:01:22.560 but more fun for you it looks cooler
00:01:24.880 well okay it does look cool
00:01:26.159 yeah yeah
00:01:29.200 how long do you think it'll be before
00:01:30.560 are you good jimmy
00:01:33.840 what's that uh is my head's maybe yeah
00:01:36.400 exactly
00:01:37.439 good how long my head is sticking out
00:01:40.640 is that where it's right it's all good
00:01:43.439 oh is that supposed to be okay you're
00:01:44.799 good
00:01:45.280 all right how long do you think it's
00:01:46.799 gonna be before you have like
00:01:48.560 regular flights with that where you can
00:01:51.840 take off and land and like an airplane
00:01:54.079 where it'll be
00:01:55.200 very consistent with our extra pointy
00:01:56.799 rocket you were your extra pointy rocket
00:02:03.439 do you mean earth to earth transport
00:02:06.560 or or
00:02:09.840 any time where you could just do it with
00:02:11.280 people and have them have it land
00:02:13.840 all the time um i think you're probably
00:02:17.200 two hours away two years away yeah
00:02:19.200 that's that's
00:02:20.480 that's really nice two years is pretty
00:02:22.720 cool
00:02:23.680 tears for people we'll we'll we'll have
00:02:25.680 a lot of flights between down there
00:02:26.959 that's crazy that's 20 23 is not that
00:02:29.200 far away that'll be there before you
00:02:30.480 know it
00:02:31.440 yeah wow 2023 10 flies
00:02:34.640 how many times have you had explosions
00:02:36.319 when you're on a rocket um
00:02:39.760 i don't know like uh quite a few six
00:02:42.560 maybe five or six
00:02:43.599 what are those like what is it like when
00:02:45.040 you watch it explode
00:02:46.640 when it's supposed to land and it just
00:02:51.440 now this this is a test program actually
00:02:54.480 we expect it to explode um
00:02:58.080 it's weird if it doesn't explode frankly
00:03:00.080 really yeah
00:03:01.280 um because we're trying to develop
00:03:04.159 advanced rockets uh at a high
00:03:05.680 at a high speed and uh if you want to
00:03:07.840 get payloads orbit
00:03:08.800 uh you you have to run things close to
00:03:11.360 the edge
00:03:12.480 and um the whole rocket is evolving the
00:03:14.879 engines the structure
00:03:15.920 the avionics the software the ground
00:03:18.239 systems
00:03:18.959 are all evolving simultaneously so and
00:03:21.599 the whole production system which is
00:03:22.720 actually harder than the rocket design
00:03:23.920 by far
00:03:24.799 so the the rocket and engine and
00:03:27.280 avionics production system
00:03:28.879 is and the launch system uh is
00:03:32.799 a thousand percent harder than the
00:03:34.159 initial design like at least
00:03:36.480 really yeah so when same with cars it's
00:03:39.840 like ten thousand percent
00:03:41.120 and it's easy to do a car prototype it's
00:03:42.959 hard to do production
00:03:44.840 um so when you're looking at you're
00:03:48.239 scaling
00:03:48.879 towards the future and you're looking at
00:03:51.040 mistakes or
00:03:52.239 uh corrections improvements and all
00:03:55.040 these different things
00:03:56.000 that's how you come up with this figure
00:03:57.599 of approximately two years
00:04:00.720 if current trends continue uh if we
00:04:04.879 you know if you plot the points on the
00:04:06.400 curve of progress then then
00:04:08.560 we should be doing regular uh orbital
00:04:11.040 flights
00:04:11.680 with a high probability of safe landing
00:04:14.799 in two years so we're getting to orbit
00:04:17.600 this year our goal is to get to over
00:04:18.798 this year
00:04:19.279 um so and and i'm not sure people
00:04:21.918 totally understand like
00:04:23.280 starship is the largest playing object
00:04:26.800 ever
00:04:27.520 made uh this thing will be
00:04:30.560 about over 5000 tons of weight on
00:04:33.919 liftoff
00:04:34.720 it's going to go straight up 5.5 000
00:04:36.560 tons
00:04:39.199 this is much heavier than any aircraft
00:04:40.880 by far there's no
00:04:42.400 no aircraft even comes close to this uh
00:04:44.479 with weight
00:04:45.520 um and it's going straight up the
00:04:46.720 aircraft can't go straight up so it's
00:04:48.080 like the
00:04:49.040 it's got more than twice it will have
00:04:50.320 more than twice the thrust of a saturn v
00:04:52.320 really yeah yeah it's like a big rocket
00:04:55.280 why does it need
00:04:56.000 that much thrust oh we try because you
00:04:58.880 want to go to mars
00:05:00.240 or is this like you know just we're
00:05:01.919 trying to make life multi-planetary
00:05:06.000 you know extend life beyond earth and
00:05:09.199 in order to do that you have to have
00:05:10.400 high tonnage to mars
00:05:12.320 and that means you need a big rocket and
00:05:13.840 you gotta fly a lot so
00:05:15.360 the reason why it has twice the thrust
00:05:17.360 of the saturn v
00:05:18.479 is to plan for these interstellar trips
00:05:22.840 uh interplanetary trips so when you when
00:05:24.880 you're doing this and you're
00:05:26.960 you're you're developing these systems
00:05:30.160 thinking about regular trips to other
00:05:32.320 planets
00:05:33.199 but you're not you're not just trying to
00:05:35.280 get into orbit right now you're trying
00:05:36.560 to get into orbit with something that
00:05:37.759 eventually could scale up
00:05:40.160 yeah we know how to get to orbit we've
00:05:41.360 done that a lot so
00:05:43.600 the the really hard thing is
00:05:46.800 we need to have a fully and rapidly
00:05:49.440 reusable rocket where the
00:05:51.039 where all elements of the rocket are
00:05:53.360 reused and they're reused quickly like
00:05:55.360 an aircraft
00:05:56.960 and this has never been done this is the
00:05:58.319 holy grail of rocketry this is uh to
00:06:01.280 have a fully uh reusable rocket then you
00:06:03.840 need to go one step further
00:06:05.280 needs to be fully and rapidly reusable
00:06:07.759 you know it's like
00:06:08.479 like a plane yeah yeah like plane lands
00:06:10.800 you
00:06:11.680 uh you know refuel it and take off again
00:06:14.240 how do you have time
00:06:15.440 this i i never understand you in regards
00:06:18.319 to the the way
00:06:19.600 you run multiple businesses
00:06:21.520 simultaneously
00:06:22.639 i would think that something like this
00:06:24.479 would require so much concentration
00:06:27.039 it would require this i would think this
00:06:29.919 would be
00:06:30.479 your whole being trying to figure out
00:06:32.560 how to work this
00:06:34.080 um yeah well i do work a lot
00:06:38.319 but it's crazy yeah and i thought just
00:06:41.120 for a reason i was late as i was
00:06:42.160 literally coming from
00:06:43.840 from the uh you know some critical
00:06:45.600 meetings just doing
00:06:47.440 normally i'd be meeting until i work
00:06:49.840 until like one or two in the morning
00:06:52.400 every night not i mean saturday
00:06:55.599 sunday usually not but sometimes how
00:06:58.319 much do you sleep
00:06:59.680 about six hours oh that's pretty good
00:07:02.000 yeah it's not that crazy
00:07:03.520 for you that's i mean for someone does
00:07:05.199 as much as you that's actually
00:07:07.120 that's impressive that you can squeeze
00:07:09.039 that in yeah
00:07:10.880 i try i've tried sleeping less but then
00:07:13.199 total
00:07:13.919 uh productivity decreases yeah so you
00:07:16.800 feel like
00:07:17.360 six is the number where it's yeah six
00:07:19.120 six uh six or six is i can that
00:07:22.479 um i i don't find myself needed wanting
00:07:25.280 more sleep than six
00:07:26.639 so when like with the saturn v
00:07:29.840 and the space shuttles and all these
00:07:31.759 other rockets you they would
00:07:33.280 they would have these parts that would
00:07:36.880 they would get the ship up into space
00:07:40.479 but they would descend down to earth and
00:07:43.039 crash into the ocean
00:07:44.240 and they would never use them again
00:07:45.599 that's right how do you avoid that like
00:07:47.360 what is the difference between the way
00:07:48.560 this these things are structured
00:07:49.919 like the the whole thing goes together
00:07:54.000 and then it lands together um well we're
00:07:56.960 on the wrong planet for
00:07:58.000 a single stage to orbit right um
00:08:01.360 i think one thing to appreciate is like
00:08:02.560 space getting to space is easy getting
00:08:04.479 to orbit is hard
00:08:06.639 so you only need maybe one or two
00:08:09.039 percent of the energy
00:08:10.720 to get to space to where the atmosphere
00:08:12.560 is thin compared to what you need to get
00:08:14.319 to orbit
00:08:15.199 and if you get to orbit now you've got
00:08:16.560 to burn off all that energy and you're
00:08:17.759 coming in like a meteor
00:08:19.120 so you need a powerful heat shield so
00:08:21.039 it's like
00:08:22.800 super difficult to get to orbit at all
00:08:26.240 and then if you get to orbit at all then
00:08:28.400 making those
00:08:29.360 the stages reusable means they're going
00:08:31.520 to come back intact
00:08:33.519 uh and then the upper stage is
00:08:35.440 especially difficult because it's got so
00:08:37.039 much energy
00:08:37.679 all the energy you put into it you have
00:08:38.958 to take out um so
00:08:41.839 it's a you know you're literally coming
00:08:44.000 in like a flaming meteor
00:08:45.839 uh and and most things would just melt
00:08:48.560 and
00:08:49.680 vapor melt or vaporize so
00:08:53.120 like if you as a human try to come in
00:08:54.399 from orbit you just be
00:08:56.240 pink missed yeah
00:09:00.480 that's a funny way to put it yeah now
00:09:02.640 the the space shuttle
00:09:03.920 they had tiles right that was the the
00:09:06.399 way they
00:09:07.120 avoided the the heat they had these heat
00:09:09.600 shield tiles what what do you use
00:09:11.600 with the spacex rockets yeah we're
00:09:15.040 uh have a more advanced version of the
00:09:16.480 shuttle tile but you got to use uh some
00:09:18.080 kind of uh
00:09:19.600 ceramic essentially uh it's a you know
00:09:23.360 usually some form of uh silicon oxide
00:09:26.080 aluminum oxide
00:09:27.600 uh some carbon perhaps thrown in there
00:09:30.720 um and is it like a one piece or is it
00:09:34.240 in tiles the way tiles yeah with a
00:09:36.399 hexagonal tile so you can see the
00:09:37.920 with each uh starship we've actually
00:09:40.080 increased the size of the heat shield
00:09:41.760 so uh it's it's tough because the
00:09:44.800 the tiles are um
00:09:48.720 uh they're they're kind of like i don't
00:09:50.640 know there's no quite the right analogy
00:09:52.399 they're kind of like dinner plates like
00:09:53.680 they're
00:09:54.399 they're brittle and they're uh
00:09:57.600 they're they they're the coefficient of
00:10:00.800 thermal expansion is different from
00:10:02.079 from metal so metal will expand and
00:10:04.160 contract differently from the tiles
00:10:07.040 and the tiles also get super hot while
00:10:09.040 the metal it can be super cold
00:10:10.880 because it's got cryogenic fluid behind
00:10:12.800 it so
00:10:14.320 you've got this differential expansion
00:10:15.680 and contraction
00:10:17.519 which makes the gaps in the tiles expand
00:10:20.880 and contract but if the gaps get too big
00:10:22.880 then you get
00:10:24.000 uh kind of the hot gas sort of the
00:10:26.399 plasma gets in down
00:10:27.760 down to get plasma in the crack and it's
00:10:29.680 not as bad
00:10:30.800 and then you're gonna melt the metal
00:10:32.399 behind it so
00:10:33.920 but if they're too close then they bang
00:10:35.839 together and they crack
00:10:38.079 so you've got to get it just right where
00:10:39.760 they're
00:10:41.279 the gaps just right and then they can
00:10:44.480 the way that they're attached to the
00:10:46.480 body they can move around a little bit
00:10:48.399 so there has to be some sort of room to
00:10:50.160 move it can't be one
00:10:52.079 large piece of ceramic that you fit over
00:10:54.480 the front
00:10:56.320 yes you can't really make a such a giant
00:11:00.000 piece of ceramic because you've got you
00:11:02.000 got well i guess you'd have like a
00:11:03.839 super gigantic oven um
00:11:07.279 but but you you really need uh you need
00:11:10.399 expansion joints
00:11:11.360 expansion contraction joints so be very
00:11:13.920 quite difficult to do a single piece
00:11:16.079 tile um think of it like tiles
00:11:19.440 for your for a roof or something like
00:11:20.800 that you know like why don't you just
00:11:22.000 make one tile for a roof
00:11:23.120 second right didn't work now
00:11:26.480 these things have multiple stages how
00:11:28.880 many stages
00:11:30.320 uh in these the rocket boosters when
00:11:32.480 when things are
00:11:34.079 taking off how many sunship has two
00:11:35.839 stages so
00:11:37.519 that's that's the minimum number that
00:11:39.600 you could do on a plane on a planet like
00:11:41.440 earth the gravity and
00:11:42.560 earth's gravity is quite strong um and
00:11:45.600 we have a thick atmosphere and strong
00:11:47.440 gravity so
00:11:49.360 uh whereas like if you took off from
00:11:51.120 mars uh it would be
00:11:52.800 it's like relatively easy
00:11:55.920 mars is around just under 40 percent of
00:11:58.399 earth's gravity
00:11:59.760 uh the moon is about a sixth and uh
00:12:03.360 getting to lunar orbit from the surface
00:12:05.120 of the moon is easy
00:12:06.800 um like but
00:12:10.079 when during apollo the lunar lander uh
00:12:13.680 just the top half of the lunar lunar
00:12:15.360 lander was able to take off and get to
00:12:17.040 lunar orbit
00:12:18.800 but to get to earth orbit you need the
00:12:20.639 giant rocket
00:12:22.320 because it's very non-linear so what
00:12:25.040 happens to the first
00:12:26.240 when when you take off and it separates
00:12:27.760 into stages how does the
00:12:29.760 the first stage get reused
00:12:33.519 well have you seen how the falcon 9
00:12:35.600 stages work where they come
00:12:37.279 back and land no you haven't seen them
00:12:39.440 no wow
00:12:41.040 um yeah i mean jamie's gonna pull it up
00:12:46.320 so does it come down with parachutes
00:12:48.160 does it like how does it uh
00:12:49.920 how does it land
00:12:52.959 no it lands uh propulsively with the
00:12:55.200 thrusters so
00:12:56.240 with the engines really yeah
00:12:59.440 so it's it's designed to take off here
00:13:02.560 it is
00:13:06.480 oh wow
00:13:11.839 so that is the bottom of the rocket that
00:13:14.880 launches it
00:13:15.920 straight up and then afterwards it comes
00:13:17.760 down and lands like that
00:13:18.959 yeah that's amazing
00:13:23.920 and then the top piece can then land
00:13:27.120 separately yes well in the case of
00:13:30.480 falcon 9
00:13:31.279 the upper stage burns up on re-entry
00:13:34.399 um falcon 9 has uh there's the the
00:13:37.360 fairing the top the
00:13:38.480 where the satellites are contained in
00:13:40.880 the top and that the fairing halves
00:13:43.040 uh once it gets to space where the
00:13:45.279 atmosphere is thin
00:13:46.240 it's still a long way from orbit uh but
00:13:48.320 it's in space
00:13:49.519 so you no longer need the the satellite
00:13:52.079 doesn't need
00:13:52.880 to be protected by the nose cone or the
00:13:54.959 fairing and so that
00:13:56.639 it sort of splits into and falls away
00:14:00.320 um and then so with falcon9 we recovered
00:14:03.279 the
00:14:03.760 the fairing house and we recovered the
00:14:05.519 booster but we lose the upper stage
00:14:08.399 on purpose
00:14:13.040 yes but it's not really possible to if
00:14:15.839 with falcon 9
00:14:18.560 we the the architecture just like
00:14:23.760 if if we made the alpha stage reusable
00:14:26.880 our padlet to orbit would be
00:14:28.399 dramatically less
00:14:30.800 so in order to have meaningful payload
00:14:33.199 to orbit
00:14:34.079 scale is important like you need to make
00:14:36.160 things big there are some
00:14:38.320 there's there is value to scale um
00:14:42.399 you know for the famous you know like
00:14:45.199 for a truck you wouldn't want like
00:14:46.720 everything
00:14:48.160 delivered by a small pickup truck you
00:14:49.680 want semi-trailers you know
00:14:51.440 um you don't see um
00:14:55.519 you don't see ships in the ocean cargo
00:14:58.720 ships
00:14:59.120 you know coming along with one sea van
00:15:02.079 and out with an outboard motor
00:15:03.680 it's like a giant ship you know so scale
00:15:06.800 has value in and of itself
00:15:08.880 um like the same the same computer that
00:15:11.680 controls
00:15:12.399 the big rocket controls the tiny rocket
00:15:14.399 so
00:15:15.600 you know even just in terms of like the
00:15:16.959 computer the computer
00:15:18.800 and like the electronics weight becomes
00:15:21.199 vanishingly small and a big rocket but
00:15:22.720 it is
00:15:23.600 significant in a small rocket do you
00:15:25.600 think there'll ever be a time
00:15:27.199 where there's an alternative source of
00:15:28.880 propulsion outside of just
00:15:30.880 of a burning fuel like is it possible
00:15:33.920 that
00:15:34.399 someone would develop a nuclear
00:15:36.320 propulsion or some
00:15:38.000 other method other than just burning
00:15:40.560 large amounts of gasoline or rocket fuel
00:15:44.800 uh there's no way around newton's third
00:15:46.560 law really
00:15:50.720 so you you basically have to expel
00:15:54.800 mass uh you you like when you get
00:15:58.399 there's a you know for a car that you
00:16:00.480 could push against the ground
00:16:01.759 for an app for an aircraft you can react
00:16:04.800 against the air
00:16:06.320 um for boat you can react against water
00:16:09.279 in
00:16:09.920 vacuum there is nothing so
00:16:13.600 you the only way to move is to react
00:16:15.759 against yourself
00:16:17.040 to essentially shoot out gas at very
00:16:20.240 high velocity uh so
00:16:22.639 and and to transfer momentum
00:16:25.920 momentum from you know to to that gas
00:16:29.120 that is going
00:16:30.000 that way very rapidly um so you want to
00:16:32.880 accelerate a small amount of mass
00:16:34.399 very fast in order to have you the large
00:16:36.720 amount of mass
00:16:38.079 accelerates slowly because momentum is
00:16:41.680 conserved
00:16:43.759 so yeah um
00:16:47.519 so we're stuck with gas yeah until
00:16:50.560 some insane breakthrough dealing with
00:16:53.440 gravity or
00:16:54.160 yeah that means it's not gonna happen
00:16:55.759 not not in our lifetime not in our
00:16:57.040 lifetime
00:16:58.639 no um yeah
00:17:02.839 so so you so
00:17:05.359 ironically uh everything will go
00:17:07.679 electric except for rockets
00:17:10.400 it's just now you can make rockets
00:17:13.119 indirectly
00:17:14.000 electric by using electricity to
00:17:17.439 create the fuel so you can take
00:17:22.000 co2 and h2o
00:17:25.359 and create methane and oxygen from that
00:17:29.440 so see it methane ch4 and oxygen is o2
00:17:32.799 so um and for example
00:17:36.160 on mars which is a primarily co2
00:17:38.000 atmosphere and there's a lot of water
00:17:39.919 ice
00:17:40.480 is you can mine the ice take the ice um
00:17:44.960 and the co2 from the atmosphere um
00:17:49.039 simplifying this a lot but run it over a
00:17:50.720 catalyst and
00:17:52.240 give it a lot of energy and you can get
00:17:56.960 ch4 and o2 and you can you can
00:17:58.640 gracefully get your propellant on mars
00:18:01.280 the the rocket by the way is mostly
00:18:02.799 oxygen so
00:18:04.880 for starship we're almost 80 oxygen
00:18:08.880 um it's only just over 20 fuel
00:18:12.880 really yeah so
00:18:16.080 is this as efficient as you anticipate
00:18:19.200 it being
00:18:19.919 you know any time in our lifetime like
00:18:22.160 is it is it
00:18:23.039 the trip to mars is like what six months
00:18:25.600 is that what the idea is yeah it's about
00:18:27.039 six months
00:18:27.760 is do you ever anticipate it being
00:18:29.600 quicker than that is it
00:18:30.880 possible to make these things faster
00:18:35.919 would you have to have solar sails like
00:18:37.520 would you know it'll be very slow
00:18:39.200 would it be um the i mean i'm trying
00:18:42.320 like the way to think about gravity here
00:18:44.720 there's a lot of analogies um but you
00:18:47.280 know
00:18:47.760 uh like
00:18:52.880 you can think like like space itself is
00:18:55.679 is
00:18:56.000 curved like it's like a funnel like if
00:18:58.160 there's something that
00:18:59.120 uh has a lot of mass it's it's it's
00:19:02.080 creating like a funnel
00:19:03.679 and um so in the same like like if you
00:19:06.400 have a coin funnel
00:19:07.520 and you the the the coins the the coin
00:19:10.080 thinks it's going in a straight line
00:19:11.600 uh pretty much um you know
00:19:15.120 uh the physicists out there might have
00:19:18.160 quibble with my analogies but
00:19:19.840 anyway i'm trying to convey what gravity
00:19:21.600 is like uh like a funnel and
00:19:24.400 so if you if you want to get out of that
00:19:26.960 gravity well
00:19:27.679 you actually need to go very fast
00:19:30.320 parallel to the earth's surface
00:19:32.080 and the faster you go parallel surface
00:19:33.919 the further out you spin
00:19:35.840 so or you can think like a marble in a
00:19:37.360 funnel like if you want that get that
00:19:38.720 marble to go far out
00:19:39.760 you just spin it sideways and it'll
00:19:42.080 it'll spiral out
00:19:43.760 and conversely if you uh
00:19:47.840 just due to the friction of of the air
00:19:49.600 friction and the rolling friction
00:19:50.960 it will slow down a little bit if you
00:19:52.400 don't give it any
00:19:54.400 any push and will slowly spiral in and
00:19:56.640 then as it gets
00:19:57.520 closer it spins faster and faster
00:20:00.000 because this is how gravity
00:20:01.520 basically works so
00:20:07.200 um all the things in the solar system
00:20:10.720 are spinning around this gigantic funnel
00:20:14.159 in space time called the sun and where
00:20:16.799 there's like these tiny little dust
00:20:18.080 motes
00:20:19.600 going around the sun and the further you
00:20:22.559 are away from the sun
00:20:23.840 the slower you move around in in terms
00:20:26.480 of degrees per second
00:20:27.840 so like the orbit of mars which is
00:20:30.240 further away from the sun
00:20:31.679 is about two years and earth's one year
00:20:34.799 um because mars is
00:20:38.000 about 50 further away from the earth
00:20:41.360 than the for from the sun than the earth
00:20:43.280 is so it's like mars
00:20:44.640 where this is at one astronomical unit
00:20:46.960 moss is like one and a half
00:20:48.159 ish astronomical union so
00:20:52.159 we're about eight light minutes away
00:20:53.360 from the sun mars is about 12.
00:20:56.000 and um yeah so
00:20:59.360 when you want to go to mars you
00:21:00.840 basically accelerate
00:21:03.520 in the along the same path of earth
00:21:05.840 going around
00:21:06.640 the sun and you time it such that as you
00:21:09.919 you that your acceleration gives you an
00:21:11.760 elliptical orbit
00:21:13.039 around the sun where the tip of the
00:21:15.120 ellipse uh intersects with mars
00:21:17.840 so mars going around you and you just
00:21:20.640 time it to
00:21:21.760 coincide with the tip of your lips being
00:21:25.120 mars and that that
00:21:26.320 turns out to be about a six month
00:21:27.919 journey now you can speed that up
00:21:31.120 i think i mean i could sort of see a way
00:21:32.960 to get make it happen in say three
00:21:34.559 months
00:21:35.360 um where the intersection with mars
00:21:37.840 would not be at the tip of the ellipse
00:21:39.200 but on the edge of the ellipse
00:21:40.880 now that would mean the tip of the
00:21:42.320 ellipse is at near jupiter so
00:21:44.320 if you miss mars you're going to end up
00:21:45.760 at jupiter
00:21:47.520 jupiter's orbit so
00:21:51.440 that's not good yeah and you're going to
00:21:53.600 be coming in
00:21:54.640 hot you know so but i
00:21:57.840 think it probably can get down to three
00:21:59.280 months of that bigger problem
00:22:01.120 getting out to month sort of hard
00:22:04.400 um
00:22:07.840 and then earth and mars are only in the
00:22:10.080 same
00:22:13.600 sort of there's only about a six month
00:22:15.360 period every two years
00:22:17.360 when uh earth and mars are aligned such
00:22:20.159 that you can do the transfer
00:22:22.240 you can certainly imagine that if mars
00:22:24.080 is on the other side of the sun
00:22:25.520 you can't get there because it's got to
00:22:26.960 go through the sun that's not going to
00:22:28.240 work
00:22:28.880 so you got to time it this is like
00:22:33.679 about a quarter of every mars year is
00:22:36.080 when you can do the transfer
00:22:37.919 so one six months every two years um
00:22:42.320 so if we are able to build or if
00:22:44.880 humanity is able to build a city on mars
00:22:47.280 um people will probably remember
00:22:50.799 you know which planetary conjunction
00:22:52.640 they came on you know
00:22:54.880 is it because it's not like you just go
00:22:57.280 all the time you can only go over two
00:22:58.880 years
00:22:59.520 when do you anticipate like how how much
00:23:01.919 time before
00:23:02.960 there's regular travel back and forth to
00:23:06.840 mars
00:23:08.080 roughly
00:23:12.080 like a real civilization on mars
00:23:18.640 well i think it's going to take a while
00:23:19.840 to build a real civilization
00:23:23.679 the i the the real the real the
00:23:26.080 threshold
00:23:26.880 that really matters is
00:23:30.240 for getting past the great filter is
00:23:35.520 do we have enough resources on mars such
00:23:38.159 that if the
00:23:38.880 uh if the spaceships from earth stop
00:23:41.279 coming
00:23:42.000 you can survive yeah so
00:23:45.200 now you can only be just missing one
00:23:46.640 little thing you'll be like you're on a
00:23:48.240 long sea voyage and the only thing
00:23:49.440 you're missing is vitamin c
00:23:51.279 uh yeah it's lucky it's only a matter of
00:23:54.640 time
00:23:55.360 you know yeah and there's gonna be
00:23:57.200 curtains so
00:23:58.960 you gotta have uh all the things
00:24:01.520 necessary to sustain civilization on
00:24:03.279 mars
00:24:05.200 and the reason that the shifts from
00:24:06.640 earth stopped coming could be
00:24:09.120 world war three or it could be due to a
00:24:12.000 slow decline of civilization
00:24:13.760 so civilization here on earth could end
00:24:16.159 with a bang or a whimper
00:24:18.000 um or natural disasters yeah asteroid
00:24:21.279 impacts
00:24:22.559 in the bank category yeah but it could
00:24:24.960 also be like a whole series of things
00:24:26.400 like say like what killed the dinosaurs
00:24:27.919 well
00:24:28.320 it wasn't just one thing you know it was
00:24:30.320 like a whole bunch of things happened in
00:24:32.400 a row
00:24:33.360 and and uh
00:24:36.559 you know um well they could have taken
00:24:39.200 any one of those things they had like
00:24:40.640 three things happen
00:24:42.159 and no dinosaurs which is kind of
00:24:44.000 amazing that crocodiles are still here
00:24:46.559 yeah those [ __ ] well they're
00:24:48.720 resilient crocodiles they
00:24:50.559 um they'll live on decayed
00:24:54.559 meat they love rotten meat and so
00:24:57.679 in a any kind of disastrous situation
00:25:01.360 there's a lot of dead creatures and the
00:25:04.159 crocodiles love it
00:25:05.120 so um that's why they're around
00:25:08.320 crocodiles and bugs and mushrooms and
00:25:11.279 shrews
00:25:13.279 true yeah which is why we're here yeah
00:25:15.520 exactly our great great great great
00:25:17.039 great great
00:25:17.760 grandparents were shrews what a strange
00:25:20.480 thing
00:25:20.960 so like yeah to come from so there's
00:25:23.200 hope there's hope for all you rodents
00:25:24.799 out there
00:25:25.360 yeah one day you can go to mars just
00:25:27.919 keep doing your homework
00:25:29.600 absolutely so so there'll be
00:25:32.640 the say the great filter what did you
00:25:35.520 mean by that
00:25:37.200 um well so
00:25:41.120 there's something called like the fermi
00:25:42.480 paradox of like where are the aliens
00:25:44.320 yeah so yeah where are the aliens
00:25:48.799 um and um i think it was carl sagan that
00:25:52.799 said like
00:25:54.400 uh if there either are
00:25:58.080 a lot of aliens or none and
00:26:01.440 the either they're equally terrifying
00:26:05.279 um if there are a lot of aliens well
00:26:08.400 i mean the invasion ship slash
00:26:11.919 uh uh you know
00:26:15.840 bug infestation just you know like
00:26:19.679 starship trooper style well yeah i mean
00:26:22.320 it's like as an alien civilization might
00:26:23.760 just
00:26:24.320 view us as like a bug infestation right
00:26:26.480 you know it's like hey we like that
00:26:27.360 planet was fine now it's got a bunch of
00:26:28.720 bugs just go fumigate it you know
00:26:30.480 um like would fumigate a house um
00:26:33.840 that's certainly possible and then uh
00:26:36.720 but if there are no aliens well
00:26:38.240 could it be that all civilizations are
00:26:40.240 just destroyed before they become
00:26:42.080 inter inter stellar you know so
00:26:46.000 uh and and i wanna be clear like
00:26:49.120 to the best of my knowledge i there is
00:26:51.360 no evidence
00:26:52.159 for alien life on earth that alien
00:26:54.320 there's no evidence
00:26:55.200 there's no evidence for alien life
00:26:56.799 there's no direct evidence
00:26:59.039 for alien life no you know and if
00:27:02.159 somebody says oh what about this alien
00:27:03.600 for uh
00:27:04.400 you know uh sighting or whatever i'm
00:27:07.600 like
00:27:08.240 listen it's got to be at least as good
00:27:10.480 as a 7-eleven or atm cam
00:27:12.880 okay it's like if somebody's got at
00:27:16.080 least like an iphone one
00:27:17.760 level camera like something you know the
00:27:20.720 problem with that is it's just too easy
00:27:22.240 to fake things today too
00:27:23.919 yeah sure they should at least try hard
00:27:26.559 in their
00:27:26.960 in fakie are you familiar with uh
00:27:29.039 commander david fravor's
00:27:31.039 account of uh the tic tac ufo that he
00:27:34.559 encountered off of the
00:27:36.159 coast of san diego you know lex lex
00:27:39.919 friedman
00:27:40.480 yeah lex friedman interviewed him on his
00:27:42.799 podcast and i interviewed him as well
00:27:44.720 and if you ever
00:27:45.679 get a chance to listen to lex's uh
00:27:47.520 conversation with them it's really
00:27:48.799 excellent but this guy is a
00:27:50.640 naval fighter pilot and he talked about
00:27:52.640 this thing that they tracked on radar
00:27:54.559 that went from
00:27:55.520 more than sixty thousand feet above sea
00:27:57.200 level to one foot in less than a second
00:27:59.760 shaped like a tic tac no visible sign of
00:28:02.559 propulsion
00:28:03.760 uh blocked radar
00:28:06.799 actively jammed their tracking systems
00:28:09.039 and then went to their predetermined
00:28:11.679 point that they were supposed to that
00:28:13.600 the the fighter jet was supposed to
00:28:14.960 scramble to
00:28:16.000 went to it uh 30 miles away in
00:28:19.200 you know a couple seconds like they have
00:28:21.360 no idea how it did it
00:28:22.480 they don't know what it is okay and
00:28:23.840 these guys that were uh
00:28:26.799 working for the navy off the coast said
00:28:28.720 they encountered them
00:28:30.000 several times they didn't know what they
00:28:31.600 were they didn't know what to do
00:28:33.919 or something they do they have video of
00:28:35.600 it uh okay
00:28:37.360 they have video of it they have um
00:28:39.440 there's do you ever see the new york
00:28:41.360 times article that came out in 2017
00:28:43.360 about this stuff
00:28:44.559 i don't know yeah there was a new york
00:28:46.960 times article in 2017 that was detailing
00:28:49.360 this
00:28:49.919 and there's a couple of there's a a
00:28:52.000 couple other different
00:28:53.120 sightings that were very similar they
00:28:54.640 were trying to figure out what these
00:28:55.760 things were and why
00:28:56.799 and it was also in the covid relief
00:28:59.520 package
00:29:00.720 that the cia was supposed to release
00:29:03.279 yeah these the politicians are trying to
00:29:05.039 figure out what all this [ __ ] is
00:29:06.960 so they try to get them to release all
00:29:08.559 the information they have within 180
00:29:10.640 days
00:29:11.360 honestly i think i would know if there
00:29:13.200 were aliens
00:29:14.640 i would hope so that's why i'm asking
00:29:15.919 you no i i i i'll be jumping on that
00:29:18.720 like
00:29:19.360 be like you should watch that
00:29:21.200 conversation with lex
00:29:23.520 like here's the thing do you think that
00:29:26.080 they would want us to know
00:29:28.399 or do you think they would just be
00:29:30.000 observing and making sure we don't
00:29:31.520 blow ourselves up would would i don't
00:29:33.600 know man they're real civilization they
00:29:35.120 sure are subtle
00:29:36.170 [Laughter]
00:29:38.720 i mean if they wanted us to know
00:29:39.840 obviously they could just for sure you
00:29:41.360 know show up and
00:29:42.320 walk down main street you know okay i'm
00:29:44.320 an alien check me out you know
00:29:45.919 right uh he has my spaceship i just
00:29:47.360 landed in the middle of times square
00:29:48.480 i'll be like right
00:29:49.679 okay or hover over downtown l.a yeah
00:29:52.159 yeah we were like okay we believe you
00:29:54.399 yeah um so whatever they're they're
00:29:57.440 very subtle very subtle because aliens
00:30:01.360 how often do you think about it zero
00:30:03.919 zero
00:30:04.480 even though you're thinking about
00:30:05.440 interplanetary travel you don't really
00:30:07.600 think about aliens
00:30:09.440 no i mean if they show up i'm like great
00:30:11.360 okay now this isn't your information
00:30:13.760 but we
00:30:14.150 [Laughter]
00:30:18.159 yeah what an interesting way of putting
00:30:20.080 it this is new information listen your
00:30:21.679 information like where are you guys up
00:30:22.960 till now
00:30:23.600 yeah um so
00:30:26.960 anyway uh listen if if i see some
00:30:30.480 evidence for aliens i'll be like i'll be
00:30:33.440 the first to be like
00:30:34.320 ah aliens you know right then you'll
00:30:36.320 investigate but until then you think
00:30:37.600 it's kind of a waste of time yeah
00:30:39.039 yeah it definitely seems like a waste of
00:30:41.279 time if nothing's happened so far you
00:30:43.440 think about all the people that have
00:30:44.240 been researching
00:30:45.200 aliens for their whole life and they
00:30:48.159 have very little
00:30:49.360 to show for it well you know there's
00:30:52.799 other than cool stories yeah um
00:30:56.559 i mean we have archaeologists going all
00:30:58.640 over the world looking at things you
00:30:59.919 know
00:31:00.159 there's this people like if if we were
00:31:02.799 to find something like let's say like a
00:31:04.640 cube of titanium just like a one inch
00:31:07.039 cube of titanium
00:31:08.159 it's in the middle of the pyramid i'd be
00:31:10.320 like aliens for sure there's no way they
00:31:12.240 could have made
00:31:12.880 a titanium back then nope there's no way
00:31:16.320 that's hard that's all one didn't even
00:31:19.360 need a computer
00:31:20.080 like your computer would be like hey wow
00:31:21.519 computers they didn't have computers
00:31:22.640 back then so it must be aliens
00:31:24.240 but but even just like some advanced
00:31:27.039 metallurgy
00:31:28.159 anything like anything like that
00:31:32.080 right nothing like that that we could
00:31:35.279 point to that we can't do
00:31:38.720 everything that we found
00:31:40.480 archaeologically is consistent with the
00:31:42.320 time
00:31:43.120 uh the technology they had at that time
00:31:44.960 archaeologically yeah
00:31:46.559 yeah yeah so you're just talking about
00:31:48.159 old stuff yeah yeah just throughout
00:31:50.000 history it's not like
00:31:50.880 you know like the like aliens visitors
00:31:53.519 would be if something buried somewhere
00:31:55.600 i think um we haven't seen anything
00:31:59.039 so anyway i mean maybe there are aliens
00:32:01.840 but they're very subtle
00:32:02.960 if they are they're just very uh they're
00:32:04.880 being pretty shy
00:32:07.440 so as far as we can tell there's none
00:32:10.880 so nor are we seeing signals from
00:32:14.080 any other solar system or anything like
00:32:16.799 that
00:32:17.120 so um
00:32:20.240 now and the thing is that um on a
00:32:22.960 galactic time scale
00:32:24.480 even with sublight travel you could
00:32:26.240 absolutely
00:32:27.600 colonize the whole galaxy even some of
00:32:29.919 the neighboring galaxies
00:32:31.600 so if you gave if you said a million
00:32:33.840 years with car
00:32:34.799 with with and say there's no there's no
00:32:37.360 new physics
00:32:38.640 could you colonize the galaxy in a
00:32:40.320 million years absolutely the entire
00:32:41.840 galaxy
00:32:42.720 so you would start with mars build bases
00:32:44.640 on mars then use mars to jump off to all
00:32:46.640 these other planets
00:32:47.840 set up places there and over thousands
00:32:50.159 of years
00:32:51.679 yeah kind of like you know from one
00:32:54.240 solar system to the next and
00:32:55.840 yeah that it seems like that's
00:33:00.240 imperative like that has to happen if
00:33:02.000 the human civilization is going to
00:33:03.279 survive
00:33:04.000 because our planet is just we're too
00:33:06.480 subject to natural disasters and our own
00:33:08.640 folly
00:33:09.279 and if the species is going to survive
00:33:11.760 we kind of have to escape it's mostly
00:33:13.279 about the species i mean
00:33:14.640 there have been some real doozies of
00:33:17.360 like
00:33:18.080 you know massive meteors and super
00:33:20.640 volcanoes and
00:33:22.080 the continents moved all over the place
00:33:24.240 and earth's been a snowball and super
00:33:26.159 hot
00:33:26.559 it the if you read like the
00:33:30.000 geological history of earth it's like
00:33:31.519 very long and complicated
00:33:34.399 um so and then there have been so many
00:33:37.679 extinction events not like
00:33:39.039 just a few um yeah i mean the
00:33:42.480 the permian extinction event that was a
00:33:44.320 real rough one
00:33:46.080 where it's like well over ninety percent
00:33:47.919 of all species
00:33:49.679 uh died out um and that doesn't tell the
00:33:52.159 whole story because
00:33:53.440 a huge chunk of the remaining species
00:33:55.200 were fungi
00:33:56.720 and um you know like sponges and stuff
00:33:59.440 like that you know
00:34:00.960 like if are you are you a sponge
00:34:04.559 okay you're probably doing okay they're
00:34:07.039 still around
00:34:08.639 are you a mushroom do you like being in
00:34:10.800 the dark and feasting on dead
00:34:12.879 dead mad dead dead plant and animal
00:34:14.639 matter okay
00:34:16.079 but if you're like a human you're
00:34:17.760 screwed yeah so
00:34:19.760 well didn't people got down to there was
00:34:22.719 just a few thousand of us at one point
00:34:24.399 in time
00:34:24.960 because of a super volcano i think
00:34:26.879 indonesia and i think it was only like
00:34:29.359 60 70 000 years ago yeah they've been a
00:34:33.119 number of sort of
00:34:34.480 revolutionary choke points yeah um and
00:34:37.520 uh
00:34:38.719 the last ice age must have been pretty
00:34:40.320 rough too a lot of species got wiped out
00:34:42.399 then
00:34:43.359 is that part of what motivates you what
00:34:46.000 what motivates you to want to
00:34:48.079 uh to do this and to put
00:34:51.199 people on mars and to start traveling
00:34:54.560 and get people traveling through the
00:34:55.918 galaxy
00:34:57.599 yeah so philosophically
00:35:00.960 i'm i'm in the douglas adams
00:35:04.160 sort of school of thought uh which is
00:35:06.800 that the universe is the answer
00:35:08.480 and we need to figure out like what
00:35:10.000 questions to ask to better understand
00:35:11.680 the answer that is the universe
00:35:14.000 so we want to expand the scope and scale
00:35:16.560 of consciousness
00:35:18.320 increase our understanding of of the
00:35:21.119 universe would like to understand why
00:35:22.320 are we here
00:35:22.960 where do we come from where are we going
00:35:24.320 what what's this all about
00:35:27.040 and in order to
00:35:30.640 in order to i don't know just
00:35:34.160 understand the meaning of life we we
00:35:36.640 have to extend
00:35:37.760 expand the scope and scale of of life
00:35:39.599 and and the consciousness which may be
00:35:43.359 digital about digital and biological in
00:35:45.520 the future
00:35:49.119 and um and again get past at least
00:35:52.320 one of the great filters which is to
00:35:54.640 become a multi-planet species
00:35:56.800 you know any a species that does not
00:35:58.560 become multi-planetary
00:36:00.720 is simply waiting around until
00:36:03.760 there is some extinction event either
00:36:07.280 self-inflicted or external so
00:36:10.640 so we got we gotta you know be a
00:36:12.800 multi-planet species also that's like
00:36:14.079 way more exciting
00:36:15.200 that's like do you want a future where
00:36:16.400 we're out there among the stars
00:36:18.480 exploring the universe or do you want a
00:36:20.400 future where we're stuck on earth
00:36:21.520 forever
00:36:22.240 i think you want the super exciting
00:36:23.760 future where we're out there exploring
00:36:25.680 the
00:36:26.880 galaxy that's that sounds great to me um
00:36:31.119 and you know i think it's worth one
00:36:33.280 percent of our resources something like
00:36:34.640 that
00:36:35.920 you know maybe more but at least one
00:36:38.079 percent
00:36:39.119 well so it's in all the most exciting
00:36:41.200 sci-fi movies yeah
00:36:43.040 yeah if you saw a sci-fi movie and they
00:36:46.160 didn't have spaceships you're like
00:36:47.359 what's going on there
00:36:48.720 yeah something terrible must happen well
00:36:51.520 we always assumed
00:36:53.200 when we were kids that we would be
00:36:55.280 traveling to the moon
00:36:56.880 and back and traveling all over space by
00:36:59.119 now you know
00:37:00.079 space 1999 was a show when i was a kid
00:37:02.560 that was uh
00:37:03.280 interplanetary travel remember they had
00:37:04.880 spaceships out there and motherships and
00:37:07.040 they thought 1999 by then for sure for
00:37:10.079 sure it would happen
00:37:11.280 the problem is we need more elon musk's
00:37:14.720 there's not a lot of people that really
00:37:16.640 dedicate all their time and energy to do
00:37:18.320 something like this
00:37:19.359 it really does it's a really fascinating
00:37:21.599 thing about the species it takes
00:37:23.440 a few unique individuals that are
00:37:26.079 motivated
00:37:27.040 to do something like this and have the
00:37:28.400 resources the intelligence and
00:37:30.320 the you can figure out how to organize
00:37:33.520 people to
00:37:34.320 to get something like this done
00:37:37.920 not a lot of you well it takes this
00:37:41.119 there's a lot of
00:37:42.000 smart talented people at spacex and a
00:37:44.079 tesla
00:37:45.760 and that's that's how we get things done
00:37:48.839 um
00:37:50.720 but yeah i mean part of the reason why
00:37:52.960 spacex is still privately
00:37:55.520 privately held although we have a lot of
00:37:57.119 investors and everyone in the company
00:37:58.560 has given stock
00:37:59.760 uh is that the time for time horizon for
00:38:02.800 spacex is is long
00:38:05.119 you know it's it's like
00:38:08.160 you know what's the market for uh
00:38:11.760 transporting things to mars well there's
00:38:14.400 no no market there's no one there
00:38:16.320 right um they were like that sounds
00:38:19.200 pretty risky
00:38:19.970 [Laughter]
00:38:21.760 and the public company you know the
00:38:24.160 feedback loop tends to be you know maybe
00:38:26.320 a year to four years or even quarterly
00:38:28.720 and it's like uh
00:38:29.599 well this is like 10 years 20 years out
00:38:32.720 and i'd probably answer a question
00:38:34.160 earlier which is like when we when i
00:38:36.000 think we can go to mars i mean i think
00:38:37.760 possibly as soon as five years from now
00:38:41.359 um really yeah but but then to have a
00:38:45.440 you
00:38:45.920 then you've got to build out the base
00:38:47.599 and then you've got to build out the
00:38:49.440 the city um so the first thing you gotta
00:38:51.920 build is like okay you gotta
00:38:53.760 um generate energy so you got like
00:38:57.119 giant solar panel farm yeah
00:39:00.240 and then you've got to have propellant
00:39:03.119 production so you gotta make the fuel
00:39:04.720 and
00:39:05.040 oxygen and you gotta you know grow food
00:39:08.320 grow plant your plants and like all the
00:39:10.079 things industry for life support
00:39:11.839 so does everything have to be done in
00:39:13.200 the greenhouse is some sort of a dome
00:39:15.359 yeah so there's is there a long
00:39:18.560 term possibility of terraforming yes
00:39:21.040 long term we can
00:39:22.480 make we can walk if you just warm mars
00:39:25.440 up
00:39:25.760 there's a lot of a frozen co2
00:39:29.520 and frozen water that would liquify
00:39:32.560 that the co2 would dance by the
00:39:34.079 atmosphere the liquid water would form
00:39:36.800 oceans and lakes so
00:39:41.119 so basically a lot of frozen water and
00:39:43.440 frozen
00:39:44.240 co2 on mars and how would you warm it up
00:39:48.160 well there's a few ways to tackle that
00:39:50.079 problem um
00:39:51.200 that'll obviously be up to the martians
00:39:52.640 but i don't know
00:39:54.560 you could have giant solar reflectors
00:39:58.079 you could um create like miniature suns
00:40:01.520 over the poles or something like that
00:40:03.520 what well it can be gravitationally
00:40:07.119 contained but you could just have a
00:40:09.119 just have to you know have it just do
00:40:12.480 giant thermonuclear explosions every few
00:40:14.720 seconds
00:40:15.920 um the sun is a giant right
00:40:18.079 thermonuclear reactor in the sky if you
00:40:19.680 want to know what like
00:40:20.800 hey what is it like to be exposed to
00:40:22.800 thermonuclear radiation
00:40:24.000 and go stand outside in the middle of
00:40:25.359 the day my 10 year old said
00:40:27.200 if space has no air and fire
00:40:30.960 needs air how does the sun stay burning
00:40:34.319 yeah she loves to do that she looks like
00:40:36.880 she's super smart
00:40:38.240 hmm right that's a good question
00:40:41.359 little one yeah there's a lot of
00:40:43.839 interesting things about the sun
00:40:45.680 um the sun is converting i think uh four
00:40:49.119 or five
00:40:50.079 million tons of mass to energy every
00:40:52.160 second
00:40:54.079 so you know e equals mc squared
00:40:57.200 so it's uh it's a lot it's a lot yeah
00:41:00.160 that's not even a big sun
00:41:01.680 it's not even a big sun so you know
00:41:04.960 four or five megatons per second every
00:41:07.200 second every day
00:41:09.040 for billions of years so what kind of
00:41:11.040 engineering would be involved in
00:41:12.560 creating a mini sun that you hover above
00:41:14.720 the poles
00:41:16.240 so i mean the sun is the it's a
00:41:18.640 gravitationally contained
00:41:20.400 uh reaction so
00:41:23.520 uh you need a lot of mass so if you
00:41:25.599 don't have a lot of mass you can just
00:41:27.119 that's why you'd have like explosions
00:41:28.800 just like little little pulsing
00:41:30.480 things like a pulsing sun um and uh yeah
00:41:34.079 some people have like said well if you
00:41:35.359 added up all the nuclear weapons on
00:41:37.280 earth that's
00:41:37.839 uh that's that wouldn't even be that
00:41:40.000 that much i'm like yeah because they're
00:41:41.359 small
00:41:41.839 we can make way bigger nuclear weap
00:41:43.920 nuclear bombs in the current ones this
00:41:45.200 is like what's the point but so well if
00:41:46.720 you want to make an artificial sun you
00:41:48.079 then you
00:41:48.800 just use a lot more hydrogen that would
00:41:50.720 be something or deuterium
00:41:52.480 they would have to construct on mars
00:41:54.560 yeah yeah and then
00:41:55.520 figure out a way to launch it yeah jesus
00:41:59.760 yeah honestly not that hard
00:42:02.800 um
00:42:03.220 [Laughter]
00:42:06.160 i mean they could do this without rarely
00:42:07.680 had even having computers uh so
00:42:09.920 this is back in the day so
00:42:12.960 um but you can also do it with like yes
00:42:15.599 solar reflectors
00:42:16.880 um i don't know somehow if you want to
00:42:18.640 make it look like a earth you got to
00:42:20.000 warm it up
00:42:20.800 right you know so
00:42:24.000 so in hundreds of years from now or
00:42:26.640 whatever it would take
00:42:27.920 people would eventually you know figure
00:42:30.240 some way out
00:42:31.040 yeah you could terraform mars and make
00:42:32.400 it be like earth
00:42:34.240 and then we could bring we could take
00:42:36.240 the life from earth and breathe life
00:42:38.240 into mars
00:42:39.359 there's nothing living on the surface of
00:42:41.359 mars
00:42:43.119 yeah nothing it's cold
00:42:46.240 yeah there's a lot of ultraviolet
00:42:49.680 like the combination of being cold
00:42:52.800 and um having a lot of ultraviolet
00:42:55.599 radiation
00:42:56.240 that's that's that's the that's that's
00:42:58.800 the killer combo
00:43:00.480 just being cold uh
00:43:03.760 then bacteria could survive uh or just
00:43:06.640 uv
00:43:07.680 but warm the bacteria can repair
00:43:09.359 themselves but if they're frozen
00:43:11.200 and they get blasted with the uv the
00:43:13.760 they can't repair themselves if they're
00:43:15.280 frozen and isn't the speculation at one
00:43:17.359 point in time mars did have an
00:43:18.560 atmosphere
00:43:19.280 mars was different than it is now
00:43:22.560 yeah it it once had a
00:43:26.000 quite a dense atmosphere and it would
00:43:27.920 have it seemed
00:43:29.200 most likely to have had oceans and lakes
00:43:31.839 um
00:43:32.560 now they're frozen and covered in dust
00:43:35.359 and the um
00:43:38.560 that orange color you see is iron oxide
00:43:41.200 so there's there's quite a lot of iron
00:43:43.760 just rust you know for a while there
00:43:45.680 they thought well maybe
00:43:46.960 mars was like some ancient civilization
00:43:49.440 you know
00:43:50.000 do you remember the face on mars i think
00:43:52.839 sure um
00:43:54.960 there's a guy that was completely con he
00:43:57.119 was fascinating
00:43:58.480 um richard hoagland is that his name
00:44:02.160 see if that's the guy's name but he's
00:44:04.800 with all due respect
00:44:06.000 out of his [ __ ] mind sure and he was
00:44:07.680 making all these incredible
00:44:09.760 incredibly bizarre connections like
00:44:12.240 measurements
00:44:13.359 from this rock to that rock and using
00:44:15.520 all this mathematics to prove that this
00:44:17.200 was
00:44:17.599 that this symmetry was impossible in
00:44:19.760 nature and this was all
00:44:21.119 created by our civilization that this
00:44:23.920 face
00:44:24.400 was like some sort of a you know
00:44:27.440 uh ancient uh shrine to whatever being
00:44:31.920 lived there before there it is monuments
00:44:33.760 tomorrow's richard hoagland that's the
00:44:34.880 guy's name
00:44:35.440 i used to listen to him on art bell
00:44:37.839 that's crazy
00:44:38.960 it was just i i mean i don't know if
00:44:41.119 he's schizophrenic
00:44:42.480 maybe he's maybe he's just smarter than
00:44:44.000 all of us but uh
00:44:46.560 well jamie's shaking his head i think
00:44:48.079 aspirationally uh you want to believe
00:44:49.920 things proportionate to the evidence
00:44:51.680 not inversely proportional to the
00:44:53.040 evidence well he was definitely
00:44:54.480 inversely proportionate to the evidence
00:44:56.319 it was very strange it was one of those
00:44:58.880 ones where i had to stop
00:45:00.079 listening because i felt like i was
00:45:01.359 going crazy too yeah
00:45:03.200 he was uh so invested in this idea
00:45:07.119 again maybe he's right um i don't think
00:45:09.839 so
00:45:10.880 no i i doubt it well then they
00:45:14.000 had subsequent voyages where they made
00:45:16.800 high resolution scans
00:45:18.000 of the exact same area and it looked
00:45:19.280 very different without the same shadows
00:45:21.200 it just looked like yeah rocks
00:45:25.280 yeah mars kind of looks like uh i don't
00:45:27.440 know like some
00:45:28.560 arizona desert or something like that
00:45:29.920 what did they think happened they think
00:45:31.119 it was hit like an asteroid hit
00:45:33.280 well everything got hit with light
00:45:34.480 asteroids over time they think that
00:45:36.160 that's what
00:45:36.960 killed the environment there the the
00:45:38.880 atmosphere um well
00:45:40.560 the atmosphere so mars has uh lower
00:45:43.599 gravity than earth and it does not have
00:45:45.599 a strong magnetic field
00:45:47.280 so over time those over
00:45:50.560 billions of years the atmosphere will be
00:45:52.960 gradually eroded
00:45:54.640 by the by the um
00:45:58.400 you know by this by the solar wind um
00:46:01.119 and
00:46:03.119 um and and having less gravity
00:46:06.240 so um you know the smaller you are the
00:46:09.599 less
00:46:10.400 generally the less atmosphere you're
00:46:11.520 gonna have um so
00:46:16.960 yeah so generating atmosphere on mars it
00:46:19.200 would eventually erode but we're talking
00:46:20.800 about hundreds of millions of years to
00:46:22.480 you know billions of years type of thing
00:46:24.079 plenty of time to figure things out for
00:46:26.960 us
00:46:27.440 yeah yeah yeah so but do you think that
00:46:30.319 mars is
00:46:31.040 their atmosphere eroded quicker because
00:46:32.800 it's just smaller just
00:46:34.480 that's a factor yeah i mean
00:46:38.160 like if you look at say asteroids or
00:46:41.680 you know they don't really have like
00:46:42.960 serious there's a pretty big asteroid
00:46:44.480 that
00:46:44.880 doesn't really have an atmosphere the
00:46:46.079 moon doesn't really have an atmosphere
00:46:48.880 so that it doesn't have an atmosphere
00:46:51.200 technically there are
00:46:52.400 there's a tiny amount of rarefied gas
00:46:54.800 but it's
00:46:55.599 not real atmosphere did you pay
00:46:57.359 attention at all to uh the the guy who's
00:46:59.440 the
00:46:59.920 chair of the harvard astronomy
00:47:02.160 department avi loeb
00:47:04.000 who was recently there's a bunch of
00:47:06.160 stories in the news because he believes
00:47:07.599 that an object that came through
00:47:09.520 our uh solar system in 2017 was
00:47:12.640 possibly extraterrestrial in origin yeah
00:47:16.160 the whatever your mommy burger
00:47:19.760 yeah they don't he thinks that there's a
00:47:21.680 90 apparently there's a 91 percent
00:47:24.240 possibility yeah it's shaped like a mama
00:47:26.240 asteroid
00:47:26.960 [Laughter]
00:47:30.640 it was a hawaiian name okay yeah it was
00:47:33.200 a hawaiian name it sounded like your
00:47:34.559 mama
00:47:35.119 yes it was like your mama yeah mao mao
00:47:38.640 or something like that
00:47:40.240 yeah yeah yeah because it was uh
00:47:42.000 discovered in hawaii so you heard a
00:47:43.680 hawaiian name
00:47:50.319 well anyway so i think a fundamental
00:47:52.720 test of human civilization is are we
00:47:54.480 going to become a multi-planet
00:47:56.400 uh civilization um before
00:48:00.160 something cataclysmic happens now be
00:48:01.920 clear i'm pretty optimistic about the
00:48:03.280 future so i'm not thinking like
00:48:05.359 we're you know civilization's about to
00:48:07.359 end anytime soon
00:48:09.680 but there's a chance that it will like
00:48:12.079 stephen hawking before he died was like
00:48:13.760 he's like he
00:48:14.480 he thought it was like around one
00:48:16.319 percent a century something like that i
00:48:17.760 believe
00:48:19.680 you know it's not it's it's not like
00:48:22.720 you know one percent chance over a
00:48:24.000 hundred years it's like night
00:48:25.760 or 99 chance of making it
00:48:28.960 you know so i think he's probably about
00:48:31.040 right so one percent chance
00:48:33.680 per century so as the centuries go on
00:48:35.680 there's less of a chance
00:48:37.200 no it's more of a chance so because we
00:48:39.359 become more intelligent more resources
00:48:42.000 and possibly the ability to escape earth
00:48:45.760 yeah i mean it's like i don't know
00:48:48.319 russian roulette with uh
00:48:50.000 you know asteroids barrels are empty
00:48:52.400 yeah click
00:48:53.119 click click eventually it's gonna get us
00:48:56.800 yeah you said something that i thought
00:48:59.359 was really interesting the meaning of
00:49:00.960 life
00:49:03.280 do you think there is a meaning to life
00:49:09.119 well i think arguably the meaning of
00:49:10.319 life is to understand the nature of the
00:49:12.960 universe
00:49:14.880 and figure out what the meaning of life
00:49:16.079 is so
00:49:19.359 uh like i said i think we don't quite
00:49:22.319 know
00:49:22.720 the right questions to ask and if we
00:49:25.839 but if we learn more about the universe
00:49:27.359 if we expand the scope and scale of
00:49:28.720 consciousness then we are better able to
00:49:30.640 ask the questions
00:49:32.240 about the answer that is the universe
00:49:36.160 but when you keep going with that like
00:49:37.599 where does it go i don't know
00:49:39.440 that's why if i knew we were like okay
00:49:42.480 the case closed we we can die now
00:49:45.760 the problem i always have with that is
00:49:47.520 that do i want there to be
00:49:49.599 a meaning to this because it it gives a
00:49:52.480 sense of purpose to finite life forms
00:49:54.880 well i think it's still there's a lot to
00:49:57.200 understand about the
00:49:58.319 the universe that we don't understand
00:50:00.319 have a beverage
00:50:01.520 absolutely so let's see alcohol is our
00:50:03.920 one what's uh our two
00:50:05.359 hour two well i don't think marijuana is
00:50:07.760 legal in texas
00:50:09.119 and the last time i don't have to remind
00:50:12.160 you
00:50:12.559 there was there's problems involved yes
00:50:16.960 ultimately not though right well
00:50:20.000 yeah it's like temporary oh that's sued
00:50:22.640 though
00:50:23.040 right didn't it cbd is legal here
00:50:26.800 cbd cbd doesn't do anything does it no
00:50:30.240 i think that's fair well it no no it
00:50:32.319 does it definitely does something for
00:50:33.920 inflammation
00:50:34.800 it does yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure
00:50:36.160 well how much do you have to have
00:50:38.160 before you notice it well psycho
00:50:40.240 physically or
00:50:41.599 yeah yeah physically you don't have to
00:50:43.599 have a lot physically cbd works great
00:50:45.839 for people with arthritis and people
00:50:47.520 with uh
00:50:48.800 like sore muscles and things like that
00:50:50.960 cheers
00:50:52.880 yeah no cbd definitely works for that
00:50:54.960 but as far as like psychoactive effects
00:50:57.520 not much it relieves anxiety for people
00:51:00.079 okay
00:51:02.079 um it helps people sleep especially when
00:51:04.720 it's uh
00:51:05.359 combined with things like melatonin you
00:51:08.480 know
00:51:08.880 things along those lines but it doesn't
00:51:10.880 get you high
00:51:15.470 [Laughter]
00:51:17.520 but people that do mix cbd with thc for
00:51:20.640 muscle creams though and that doesn't
00:51:21.839 get you high either but it
00:51:23.040 increases the effectiveness okay yeah
00:51:25.119 there's some some creams that are really
00:51:26.559 good that people like that have uh
00:51:28.559 thc and cbd in it all right
00:51:32.960 so you like have like sunscreen or
00:51:34.160 something and then i mean why not
00:51:36.400 just throw it in there you know why not
00:51:38.480 yeah well it's just
00:51:40.400 it's great for soreness it just smells
00:51:42.640 like wheat all day
00:51:43.760 yeah it doesn't smell like weed it
00:51:45.200 doesn't no no some of it does though
00:51:48.400 so that's the thing about anything
00:51:49.760 that's unregulated right like hippies
00:51:51.200 are making it
00:51:52.000 that's always the problem quality
00:51:53.839 control yeah no quality control that's a
00:51:55.760 problem with edibles
00:51:57.040 they're made by a bunch of crazy people
00:51:59.359 cooking them up in some you know
00:52:01.520 chula vista apartment somewhere you
00:52:04.000 really don't know what's in there
00:52:07.520 so well anyway so we gotta make life
00:52:09.599 multiplanetary before it's too late yeah
00:52:11.440 um i think that makes sense yeah i mean
00:52:13.920 why not it's also it's be fun and
00:52:15.359 exciting and even if you don't go you
00:52:16.559 can just watch it on tv yeah
00:52:18.880 yeah it's still cool i mean like yeah i
00:52:21.440 mean
00:52:22.000 you know it's not like you know
00:52:24.559 attendance is mandatory here
00:52:26.000 uh you know and uh it'll be dangerous
00:52:28.240 and people might die
00:52:30.240 well for sure they're to die yeah like
00:52:32.720 sometimes
00:52:33.680 maybe surprise some people think that uh
00:52:36.400 ideas like oh mars is going to be an
00:52:37.760 escape hatch
00:52:38.880 some luxury resort for rich people i'm
00:52:40.400 like no it's like high probability of
00:52:42.400 death
00:52:43.040 relative to earth uh it's long journey
00:52:46.800 food's probably not great a lot of hard
00:52:49.119 work
00:52:50.480 no sunlight yeah it's i mean it's like
00:52:52.960 it sounds like
00:52:53.760 you know shackleton's out for the
00:52:56.000 antarctic where it's like it's like it's
00:52:57.760 dangerous
00:52:59.040 it's a long journey the food's bad you
00:53:01.760 know
00:53:02.720 might not make it back but if you do
00:53:05.280 it'll be glorious
00:53:06.800 yeah it's interesting how much people
00:53:09.119 adapt when they're faced with a real
00:53:11.040 problem
00:53:12.000 like if we knew that we only had a
00:53:14.160 certain amount of time left like we knew
00:53:16.000 an
00:53:16.240 asteroid was absolutely headed our way
00:53:18.720 and it was going to kill most of the
00:53:19.920 people on this planet
00:53:21.280 you would see people scrambling for
00:53:22.800 something like that yeah like look
00:53:25.040 uh i moved to texas just to get the [ __ ]
00:53:27.760 out of la because i felt like that was
00:53:29.359 dying
00:53:30.079 i was like we got to get out of here and
00:53:31.920 i never thought i was going to
00:53:33.520 move out of la like that yeah it
00:53:35.680 happened very quickly but people adapt
00:53:38.079 when they realized that
00:53:39.920 this is you have to do something yeah if
00:53:42.400 we had to do something we had to go to
00:53:44.000 mars and had to set up shop there
00:53:47.440 yeah i think it's important for the
00:53:48.720 future of humanity and consciousness and
00:53:51.760 like i said we want to get past the
00:53:53.040 great filter you know it might turn out
00:53:55.200 that when we were
00:53:56.559 out there exploring the galaxy we might
00:53:58.319 find a whole bunch of
00:54:00.079 dead one planet civilizations you know
00:54:02.559 and they were just they just never made
00:54:03.680 it to the
00:54:04.559 next planet ghost towns yeah strange
00:54:07.359 ghost towns of like
00:54:09.359 you know it's like if you you know we're
00:54:11.440 like we'll go through the archaeological
00:54:13.119 ruins of likes like ancient babylonians
00:54:15.280 and sumerians and like
00:54:17.440 you know like trying to decode their
00:54:19.839 writing like what the hell linear be
00:54:21.839 and in hieroglyphics isn't that a
00:54:24.720 problem with us
00:54:25.760 now that everything has become digital
00:54:27.599 everything's stored on
00:54:28.880 microchips and hard drives and and if
00:54:31.359 something
00:54:31.920 catastrophic happened yeah and you don't
00:54:34.720 have the ability to access
00:54:36.559 all that stuff we're kind of starting
00:54:38.000 from scratch yeah absolutely um
00:54:41.040 it's kind of problematic that things
00:54:42.240 aren't children stone you know they used
00:54:43.760 to be chills in a stone
00:54:44.720 like okay now you know it's kind of a
00:54:46.960 pain in the ass to destroy stone
00:54:48.640 and this don't last a long time yeah so
00:54:50.559 we still have a lot of writing from
00:54:52.000 the ancient romans because they chose a
00:54:54.640 lot of stuff in stone
00:54:55.839 or the egyptians well the egyptians yeah
00:54:57.599 exactly man the egyptians really went to
00:54:59.599 town with the hieroglyphics
00:55:01.680 even the sumerians you know the
00:55:03.040 cuneiforms carved in the clay tablets
00:55:05.760 absolutely yeah
00:55:07.200 um but i kind of wish they'd said more
00:55:09.359 yeah exactly look at us and like
00:55:12.000 our stuff is yeah it doesn't it's not
00:55:15.119 going to
00:55:15.680 last for a long time i mean i mean
00:55:17.760 there's sort of aspects of us
00:55:19.440 of our stuff that would last for a long
00:55:20.960 time but a lot of the interesting
00:55:23.040 things are going to be lost forever yeah
00:55:24.880 um you know
00:55:26.079 for when we did the falcon heavy test
00:55:28.079 flight um
00:55:30.480 that uh normally when you know aerospace
00:55:33.920 companies do
00:55:34.799 like a rocket test flight they put
00:55:36.240 something boring on like a concrete
00:55:38.319 block
00:55:39.280 uh because they don't want to risk an
00:55:40.960 expensive satellite
00:55:42.559 and so i was like well we got to do
00:55:43.760 something that's not very inspiring you
00:55:45.280 know
00:55:45.599 because concrete blocks are the least
00:55:46.880 expensive inspiring things you could do
00:55:48.079 so
00:55:48.960 i was telling a friend of mine and he
00:55:50.960 said hey uh well what about putting a
00:55:53.359 a tesla on that you know i was like hey
00:55:55.200 that sounds like a good idea
00:55:56.400 i'm gonna go into my garage i'll put
00:55:58.000 that one in there so i put my car
00:56:00.000 on the rocket and then we
00:56:03.280 we want to see how far the rocket could
00:56:04.640 go so like just you know floor it let's
00:56:06.880 go
00:56:07.440 maximum delta v so i thought it would
00:56:10.799 probably blow up and i had this image of
00:56:12.160 like a man it was like
00:56:14.000 you know this thing could go could blow
00:56:15.839 up on the pad and then
00:56:17.520 there's like a tire bouncing down the
00:56:19.040 road and then the tesla logo just lands
00:56:20.799 bam right in front of the camera
00:56:24.319 it's like one of the things that like
00:56:25.760 this is a movie you know
00:56:27.599 that's kind of one of the possible
00:56:29.440 outcomes and unfortunately it didn't
00:56:31.280 blow up and
00:56:32.160 now my car is uh orbiting mars wow
00:56:35.359 yeah so now in that car so so now
00:56:38.720 hopefully if somebody in the
00:56:39.920 alien civilizations in the future could
00:56:41.359 find that because it'll be like around
00:56:42.480 for like millions of years
00:56:43.680 i've seen the images of it with the it
00:56:46.319 looks fake
00:56:46.960 it looks that's how you know it's real
00:56:48.640 is that how you know
00:56:50.240 yeah how do the images get to us it's
00:56:52.880 it's the images are too lame to be
00:56:55.040 to be to be fake uh or i mean they look
00:56:58.480 good but you for example the
00:57:00.240 the dynamic range of the camera is not
00:57:02.720 enough to pick up the stars
00:57:04.559 and the the vehicle you know because
00:57:06.799 they're like
00:57:08.319 things are very bright in space there's
00:57:10.079 no uh like we don't quite realize it but
00:57:12.400 in the app
00:57:12.880 like the the atmosphere is making
00:57:16.319 everything a little fuzzy
00:57:18.079 and it's based things are super crisp
00:57:19.920 and super like really reflective
00:57:22.319 yeah there it is yeah exactly so so how
00:57:24.480 is that getting to us
00:57:26.480 with an image yeah with a radio
00:57:30.079 wow yeah so the rocket's got a
00:57:34.079 how many megapixels is that image not
00:57:36.079 that many actually
00:57:37.119 really no i mean it's probably a couple
00:57:39.280 megapixels or something like that so
00:57:40.640 like an old flip phone
00:57:42.400 yeah um it's mostly just
00:57:45.440 driven by the what what's the bandwidth
00:57:48.400 of a video signal
00:57:49.520 so what do you have these are frame
00:57:50.960 grabs from the from the video signal
00:57:53.040 but and where's the where's the camera
00:57:54.880 that's taking this photo
00:57:57.040 oh man our director of photography is
00:57:58.559 awesome
00:58:00.880 but i mean when this thing gets sent to
00:58:03.040 us what is taking an image of this
00:58:05.839 there's a camera on a stick really yeah
00:58:08.480 and it didn't break off
00:58:09.760 no i mean thought it might but
00:58:13.599 there's a camera i mean it's
00:58:16.880 it's kind of a like a fairly wide angle
00:58:19.119 and looks like the camera is actually
00:58:20.799 not that far from the car
00:58:23.839 what is that one up there that shows the
00:58:25.440 whole car is that fake that's fake
00:58:28.079 is that real that's real wow it says
00:58:30.480 don't panic on the screen
00:58:31.760 yeah don't panic
00:58:35.599 speaking of the roadster when is that
00:58:37.119 thing going to be available
00:58:40.720 uh next generation roadster so we're
00:58:42.240 we're finishing the engineering of it
00:58:43.520 this year
00:58:44.160 and so hopefully start shipping them
00:58:46.240 next year really
00:58:47.359 yeah um and that we're going to throw
00:58:49.359 some rocket technology in that car so
00:58:50.799 yeah i've heard about that what does
00:58:51.839 that mean
00:58:52.880 um so at a minimum it would be uh hover
00:58:57.359 i wanted to hover and like i'm trying to
00:59:00.400 make this thing hover with that you know
00:59:03.680 killing people right yeah good call yeah
00:59:06.400 exactly
00:59:07.440 i thought like maybe we could make it
00:59:09.119 hover but like uh not too high
00:59:11.599 you know so like maybe it can hover like
00:59:13.599 a meter above the ground or something
00:59:15.599 yeah you know like if you plummet you
00:59:18.559 blow out the suspension but you're not
00:59:20.000 gonna die
00:59:21.200 so maybe you're six feet i don't know
00:59:23.200 six feet probably fully okay you're not
00:59:24.799 gonna die either
00:59:26.000 probably not probably not so
00:59:29.200 if we just put a height limit on it
00:59:30.559 probably probably fine and would it be
00:59:32.480 able to travel while it's hovering
00:59:34.160 yeah so you'll be able to go six feet
00:59:36.640 off the ground
00:59:37.359 and go how fast well
00:59:40.640 uh you go pretty fast but the you're
00:59:43.359 gonna be time limited
00:59:44.720 right so like a jet like like it's just
00:59:47.839 gonna be a super high pressure
00:59:49.680 like ultra high pressure air bottle in
00:59:52.000 the oh
00:59:52.720 so so the standard roadster would have
00:59:54.400 like two two back seats two like kid
00:59:56.559 seats you know in the back like small
00:59:57.920 seats like a back of a porsche or
00:59:58.960 something
01:00:00.319 or if you get the uh i don't know the
01:00:03.359 spacex option package
01:00:05.119 uh then in that place where the two rear
01:00:07.599 seats are would be is a
01:00:10.799 a high pressure carbon overwrap pressure
01:00:12.480 vessel so high very uh you know
01:00:14.720 i don't know 10 000 psi or something
01:00:16.319 like that and
01:00:19.200 uh and then a bunch of thrusters and so
01:00:22.480 like at minimum i'm confident we could
01:00:24.240 do a thruster where the the
01:00:26.079 license plate flips down you know james
01:00:28.079 bond style and there's a rocket thruster
01:00:29.599 behind it
01:00:30.480 and that and that gives you three tons
01:00:32.480 of thrust and oh for acceleration yeah
01:00:34.880 so that would be on the ground that'll
01:00:37.040 be on the ground and this thing would
01:00:38.160 move like about out of hell jesus
01:00:39.440 correct but it already goes
01:00:40.720 0-60 in 1.9 seconds right that's the
01:00:43.040 sedan
01:00:43.839 or the four-door what yeah how fast this
01:00:47.119 is the new model s
01:00:48.000 model s plaid that we start shipping
01:00:49.599 next month or this month
01:00:51.760 is uh we just tested it on the motor
01:00:55.280 trend spec
01:00:56.079 0 to 60 is 1.96
01:00:59.520 seconds i have never driven my tesla and
01:01:01.520 go why is this thing a little [ __ ]
01:01:03.280 faster
01:01:04.319 yeah i mean the one i have the model s
01:01:06.720 is 2.4
01:01:08.079 right yeah which is preposterous it's so
01:01:10.480 great i take people in it like yeah
01:01:11.920 they've never
01:01:12.480 experienced anything like it no in their
01:01:14.559 entire life my friend tim dillon is like
01:01:16.480 so what's the deal with these teslas and
01:01:18.240 i go you want you want to freak out you
01:01:19.520 want to see something [ __ ] crazy i
01:01:21.119 picked him up at the improv we drove to
01:01:22.559 the comedy store yeah and i i took him
01:01:24.240 up laurel canyon are you ready
01:01:27.760 i never take it out of ludicrous mode by
01:01:29.280 the way i keep it in ludicrous mode all
01:01:30.640 the time that's fine
01:01:31.440 i stomped on the gas well not the gas
01:01:33.520 the accelerator and
01:01:34.799 he started screaming
01:01:38.240 what the [ __ ] i go yeah it's what the
01:01:40.559 [ __ ] this is crazy it's crazy it's crazy
01:01:42.960 yes so this is
01:01:44.160 significantly faster than that just for
01:01:46.160 the plaid yeah so the
01:01:47.599 the new the new plaid yeah it's a half
01:01:49.280 second quicker to 60.
01:01:51.119 pretty close yeah yeah like uh i mean
01:01:53.680 every millisecond
01:01:54.799 really matters when you start getting
01:01:56.160 that that fast i thought plaid was going
01:01:58.319 to ship
01:01:58.880 later in the year yeah we've
01:02:02.240 juiced it we managed to make it go
01:02:03.920 faster oh that's better
01:02:08.960 and the plaid has a wider wheelbase too
01:02:11.119 right it does yeah and so it handles
01:02:12.720 better is that the idea behind that yeah
01:02:13.920 it does have better handling
01:02:15.200 um like we're trying to get to on the
01:02:18.000 nurburgring get to
01:02:19.440 like the low seven minute mark really
01:02:21.599 yeah um and then
01:02:23.839 you know with further improvements i
01:02:25.359 think we could we could bust seven
01:02:26.880 minutes on the nurburgring which would
01:02:28.319 be a pretty wicked outcome what is the
01:02:30.079 record right now at the nurburgring
01:02:32.400 is it the porsche 918 like what has the
01:02:34.400 record something crazy like that right
01:02:36.480 some there's no no production car i
01:02:39.119 think no production car has gotten under
01:02:40.559 seven
01:02:41.280 um really as far as i know and even the
01:02:44.240 ones that are close
01:02:45.440 that they say our production are they
01:02:47.520 they do a bunch of changes
01:02:48.880 right like change the tires the
01:02:50.880 aerodynamics
01:02:52.000 yeah yeah but it's like
01:02:55.599 yeah i think there's potential to have a
01:02:57.520 car that as delivered
01:03:00.000 can beat seven seconds on on nurburgring
01:03:02.319 isn't it funny that this is one track
01:03:04.160 that's the gold standard for almost all
01:03:06.240 vehicles like if you look at like
01:03:08.160 road and track or motor trend do you
01:03:09.920 want to find out what how badass this
01:03:12.000 new sports car is
01:03:13.200 it's like what number does it do in the
01:03:14.839 nurburgring
01:03:16.640 well yeah now never going to be totally
01:03:18.720 frank is not
01:03:20.000 representative of normal no it's not
01:03:22.160 normal yeah
01:03:23.119 um it's it's the hottest one to you
01:03:26.000 can't game it
01:03:26.880 you know so um but i think for
01:03:30.799 everyday driving it's the acceleration
01:03:32.720 that really matters
01:03:33.839 like it's like you know you're at a you
01:03:36.240 know the light goes green
01:03:37.440 bloom who's across the intersection
01:03:39.839 fastest
01:03:40.799 um the new plan will do uh you know a
01:03:44.319 sub nine second
01:03:45.280 quarter mile and with a with an extra
01:03:48.160 trap speed and a quarter mile of 155
01:03:50.640 miles an hour and it's a sedan
01:03:52.640 yeah it's a four door it it can hit 60
01:03:55.200 miles an hour before it's cleared the
01:03:56.559 intersection
01:03:57.599 that's insane insane that's insane yeah
01:04:00.640 wow it's uncomfortably fast
01:04:03.839 is that steering wheel legit yeah is it
01:04:06.079 legal yeah i mean formula
01:04:07.920 they they use a a yoke in formula one
01:04:10.880 they don't have a strawberry
01:04:11.760 but you're not on the highway formula
01:04:14.079 one car
01:04:15.200 yeah yeah i like driving like this like
01:04:18.160 resting my hand on the top of the wheel
01:04:20.400 well you i think the autopilot is
01:04:22.720 getting good enough that you won't need
01:04:24.079 to
01:04:24.640 drive most of the time unless you really
01:04:26.319 want to i like driving
01:04:28.000 okay yeah i use autopilot sometimes i
01:04:30.960 mean but
01:04:31.599 most of the time i drive i
01:04:34.720 i i find it's like you can rest your
01:04:36.720 hand on your knee
01:04:38.000 that kind of thing and uh it it works
01:04:40.400 great anyway it looks awesome
01:04:41.760 it does look cool yeah yeah it's very
01:04:43.839 space shippy
01:04:45.200 yeah yeah it's great and all the stuff
01:04:47.520 is on the steering wheel now too right
01:04:49.520 the blinkers and all that jazz even the
01:04:51.599 horn is like a little button right
01:04:54.960 uh yeah when the horn is already
01:04:58.640 kind of the center of the the steering
01:05:00.559 wheel anyway but is it still the center
01:05:02.319 of the steering wheel as well yeah yeah
01:05:03.680 but isn't it a button
01:05:04.799 i thought on the yoke there's a button
01:05:07.200 for the horn
01:05:08.480 yeah i which you have to really i used
01:05:11.280 to have a car that had a button
01:05:12.960 for the horn i think it was an acura nsx
01:05:15.520 okay and it had uh
01:05:16.799 instead of the center hub being the horn
01:05:19.119 there was a button and yeah
01:05:21.039 i never remembered it
01:05:24.319 well with the there there are no yokes
01:05:27.520 okay they're sorry there are no stalks
01:05:29.200 there's so with this right there's a
01:05:30.799 there's a yolk but there's no stalks so
01:05:32.559 the car for example
01:05:34.240 will default to driving in the like if
01:05:36.559 you just get in
01:05:38.160 um when you press the brake pedal and
01:05:40.799 then press the accelerator
01:05:42.400 uh it will figure out whether you want
01:05:43.839 to go backwards and forward that's crazy
01:05:45.599 how's that possible well just you know
01:05:48.000 it's just
01:05:48.640 looks and sees is there an obstacle in
01:05:51.039 front okay probably don't wag it so you
01:05:52.640 probably want to go backwards
01:05:53.920 right but what if you want to go
01:05:54.960 backwards and there's nothing in front
01:05:56.480 of you
01:05:58.079 yeah what if it's ambiguous right um
01:06:01.119 so it would it would default to um
01:06:04.240 the invoice of whatever you you started
01:06:06.480 um and then
01:06:07.280 you can just you can just swipe on the
01:06:08.640 screen and change direction
01:06:11.200 but isn't it easier to just hit like
01:06:13.200 that way to get almost never
01:06:15.039 you'll see it's like you almost never do
01:06:16.799 you do it yeah so you've been
01:06:18.640 this is something you've driven and it's
01:06:20.960 intuitive
01:06:21.839 yeah once you get rid of the stalk and
01:06:23.440 have the car figure it out
01:06:25.200 it's annoying to have a stalk after that
01:06:27.760 real it's annoying
01:06:28.880 you're talking to a guy likes manual
01:06:30.839 gearboxes
01:06:32.480 sure i like i like going yeah i mean i
01:06:35.520 learned
01:06:36.319 drive on manual too it's fun yeah it's
01:06:38.480 cool
01:06:39.440 yeah there's different kinds of cool
01:06:40.799 though like i uh the one
01:06:43.280 when i tell people about the tesla i go
01:06:45.359 listen i love
01:06:46.799 cars i love all kinds of cars but the
01:06:49.200 tesla makes other cars seem dumb
01:06:51.520 it does it makes them seem dumb yeah it
01:06:53.760 just it's so fast
01:06:55.119 it's so quiet everything about it the
01:06:58.000 navigation screen is so big like why
01:06:59.599 wouldn't it be big
01:07:00.400 yeah it's better it's better to be big
01:07:02.480 yeah it keeps the software keeps getting
01:07:03.920 upgraded
01:07:04.480 the navigation system the ability to
01:07:06.240 just press that button
01:07:07.599 and say navigate to and then it goes on
01:07:09.520 the internet and finds out what you're
01:07:10.559 looking for
01:07:11.200 and finds it restaurants yeah whatever
01:07:12.799 you're looking for it's [ __ ] amazing
01:07:14.720 oh there's a like a little uh tip for
01:07:16.640 the tesla if you just
01:07:18.400 uh swipe down on the navigate button it
01:07:21.119 automatically figures out if you want to
01:07:22.480 go to home or work
01:07:23.839 and navigates there so if you're if
01:07:26.079 you're
01:07:26.960 uh at at home and obviously you know how
01:07:29.280 to get to work but do you know the
01:07:30.559 fastest way to get to work
01:07:33.359 today's type technology yeah like what's
01:07:35.200 that on a traffic adjusted basis what's
01:07:36.960 the best way to go
01:07:38.000 to go to work but how does it adjust
01:07:39.680 like what is it getting your data from
01:07:41.359 it's downloading traffic data from the
01:07:42.640 internet okay so waze uses traffic data
01:07:45.440 from the internet plus
01:07:46.319 user input so like it takes
01:07:49.359 an extra beat to get the traffic data
01:07:51.680 from the internet the idea of waze is
01:07:53.839 that you're getting it from users in
01:07:55.359 real time
01:07:56.079 like there's a car accident people
01:07:58.240 program it in hey folks there's a
01:07:59.599 [ __ ] car accident here
01:08:00.799 and then you get it right away whereas
01:08:02.400 on the internet you're a couple beats
01:08:03.920 behind
01:08:05.039 yeah i mean we we get the traffic data
01:08:06.720 from google okay
01:08:08.160 oh so it is for waze because google well
01:08:10.400 google is slightly different but they
01:08:11.680 have
01:08:12.319 similar data sets yeah yeah yeah so
01:08:14.880 basically like
01:08:15.839 let's say there's an accident on the way
01:08:16.960 to work or road closure or something
01:08:18.719 like that
01:08:19.439 uh we were helpful to know that before
01:08:20.960 you encountered it so um if you just
01:08:23.120 swipe down it'll automatically navigate
01:08:24.560 to work
01:08:25.600 and then also the the the autopilot will
01:08:28.158 work
01:08:28.640 basically seamlessly on the way to work
01:08:31.520 like
01:08:31.920 we have the the beta out and beta's
01:08:35.279 working pretty well
01:08:36.000 it's going to get super good and it'll
01:08:39.120 basically be able to drive you all the
01:08:40.158 way to work automatically you don't even
01:08:42.640 like you basically just get in and it'll
01:08:45.600 assume you're going to work if it's
01:08:46.640 monday to friday in the morning
01:08:49.600 or you could say program maybe go to
01:08:52.080 school drop the kids over at school then
01:08:53.679 go to work
01:08:54.640 but you just do this stuff automatically
01:08:56.319 you want to take the perspective of all
01:08:58.319 input is error if you have to do
01:09:01.040 something
01:09:01.600 it's an error make the error smaller
01:09:05.120 um well they're all input all input is
01:09:07.600 error unless it's a game
01:09:08.799 although all input is error well
01:09:11.920 that's the other thing too it has games
01:09:14.640 like you play chess
01:09:16.238 yeah you can play chess we got we got
01:09:18.479 the
01:09:19.359 backgammon with the same with the
01:09:21.198 aesthetic described
01:09:22.960 uh in lost uh j.j evans asked for
01:09:25.120 backgammon so we put it back avenue
01:09:27.120 with the lost aesthetic uh it's got uh
01:09:30.399 this a really fun game called polytopia
01:09:33.759 that's i would say that's my top
01:09:34.960 recommendation for any game in the car
01:09:36.880 is play polytopia what is that
01:09:39.920 it's like it's a real fun strategy game
01:09:42.479 uh that's uh
01:09:44.399 you'll you'll see like just it's the top
01:09:46.158 of the list this is not something you
01:09:47.839 can play while you're driving
01:09:50.080 well i mean you're not supposed to play
01:09:51.600 white that would be illegal
01:09:54.238 but would it work while you're on
01:09:56.000 autopilot
01:09:57.280 so if you're on autopilot can you also
01:09:58.880 play chess well you have to
01:10:00.719 tap a button that says you're the
01:10:01.840 passenger oh
01:10:04.800 kind of like waze okay kind of like waze
01:10:08.640 yeah so it's open for interpretation
01:10:11.920 so if you are uh some chess
01:10:15.120 freak you could literally play chess on
01:10:17.199 your way to work
01:10:18.400 yeah wow
01:10:21.760 i mean in the future as the car becomes
01:10:24.320 more and more autonomous
01:10:27.199 it's going to be really about
01:10:28.080 entertainment entertainment productivity
01:10:31.040 yeah so it's just probably entertainment
01:10:34.719 first and foremost and then you know
01:10:36.000 productivity as well do you have
01:10:38.080 specific things that you do on your way
01:10:40.000 do you listen to books on tape do you
01:10:41.440 listen to music
01:10:42.840 like yeah you should listen to music
01:10:46.560 oh those [ __ ] pirate songs you like
01:10:49.440 the sea shanties
01:10:52.320 i i thought you were joking about that
01:10:54.719 until you played them
01:10:55.840 yeah yeah and catchy they're pretty
01:10:58.080 catchy that's what's crazy i started
01:11:00.080 researching stuck in your head i did not
01:11:02.560 know that it was really a thing
01:11:03.840 yeah yeah yeah
01:11:06.600 [Laughter]
01:11:08.239 jamie do you know do you know about the
01:11:10.400 sea shanties oh my god
01:11:13.199 yeah well and there's actually something
01:11:15.040 really appealing about uh
01:11:16.320 people singing in harmony yeah but it's
01:11:19.199 actually way better than you think
01:11:20.480 it's also like it's got like a weird
01:11:22.080 renaissance fair type thing to it
01:11:24.000 you feel like you're uh you're all
01:11:25.600 together in this old-timey thing
01:11:28.239 you know pretending yeah very strange
01:11:32.560 yeah it's very odd so
01:11:35.840 um it seems like one of the top reasons
01:11:38.480 to be a pirate would be
01:11:40.239 we have sea shanties and we have
01:11:42.480 tropical taverns
01:11:43.760 and um i don't know cool outfits cool
01:11:46.640 outfits
01:11:47.199 yeah sure you get scarves dress up yeah
01:11:49.840 you get to dress weird
01:11:51.280 yeah if you lose your leg they got pegs
01:11:53.120 for you yeah you got a parrot
01:11:54.880 yeah a parrot how'd that happen now what
01:11:57.520 about uh
01:11:58.400 the truck when is that thing gonna
01:11:59.920 happen
01:12:02.320 uh cyber truck yeah so we're building a
01:12:04.080 big factory here in austin that's where
01:12:05.360 we'll make the cyber truck
01:12:06.880 yeah now did you decide to do
01:12:10.000 this in austin from the jump or did
01:12:12.080 along the way you decide to move the
01:12:14.640 cyber factory the cyber truck factory
01:12:16.480 here yeah well
01:12:18.320 uh i frankly i just well austin is a bit
01:12:22.000 like many california so i was like
01:12:23.920 asking the team in california all right
01:12:26.719 where
01:12:27.760 where do you want to what's your top
01:12:29.360 choice for you know
01:12:30.960 a next big u.s factory a location
01:12:34.640 like where do you want to spend time and
01:12:36.800 uh
01:12:37.679 the number one choice was austin uh and
01:12:40.560 then i was like okay okay what's number
01:12:42.080 two
01:12:42.640 uh silence
01:12:43.690 [Laughter]
01:12:48.159 yeah so many california here in austin
01:12:50.480 it is a lot right
01:12:51.920 yeah yeah it's it's i mean i i i
01:12:54.640 hesitate talking about it because i've
01:12:55.840 talked about it too much
01:12:57.440 but it's it's very utopian
01:13:00.480 yeah um yeah i think austin's going to
01:13:04.640 be the biggest boomtown
01:13:05.760 that america has seen in half a century
01:13:08.640 i think it's a great response to the
01:13:10.159 [ __ ] up government in some of the
01:13:11.679 other cities
01:13:13.520 yeah i mean i think you know yeah um
01:13:18.480 i think we do need to make sure that
01:13:20.719 austin does not
01:13:22.400 you know people moving from california
01:13:23.600 don't inadvertently recreate the issues
01:13:26.320 that they
01:13:26.880 moved yeah caused them to move in the
01:13:29.040 first place yes
01:13:30.719 so the balance of austin is a blue city
01:13:33.199 in a red state
01:13:34.800 and it's almost like it kind of has to
01:13:36.719 stay red
01:13:37.920 not kind of has to i think it does you
01:13:40.159 need the certain amount of freedoms
01:13:41.920 but then you need the philosophical like
01:13:44.400 there's a there's a
01:13:45.280 bend to austin that's very progressive
01:13:47.760 and open-minded and artistic
01:13:49.440 and the restaurants are amazing the
01:13:51.280 people are really cool
01:13:52.560 but it needs to be sort of embraced by
01:13:57.120 guns and god freedom
01:14:00.719 that's part of the whole mixture that
01:14:02.159 makes it work and that's
01:14:04.159 you know it's it's kind of there's a
01:14:07.280 there's a metaphor to life in there
01:14:08.800 somewhere you know yeah that's protected
01:14:11.360 by the rest of the philosophy of texas
01:14:15.120 which is a wild crazy place that has
01:14:17.520 more tigers
01:14:18.880 in private collections than in all of
01:14:21.440 the wild of the world
01:14:23.040 really yes i had a bit about it in my
01:14:26.360 2016 special
01:14:28.480 texas it's a lot of tigers man has more
01:14:30.800 tigers
01:14:31.520 in captivity than all of the wild of
01:14:34.719 planet earth
01:14:37.040 okay yeah well these are people's yards
01:14:40.320 they could attack in your place
01:14:44.239 wherever you live you could get a
01:14:45.840 [ __ ] zebra no
01:14:47.360 like i have a friend who lives out in
01:14:49.199 dripping springs he saw a zebra
01:14:51.120 okay a zebra got loose there's elk out
01:14:54.480 there
01:14:54.960 all right wild elk just roaming around
01:14:57.360 somebody had an elk
01:14:58.400 jumped the fence now there's an elk out
01:14:59.840 there it was an axis deer in my
01:15:02.159 neighborhood i saw an
01:15:03.040 axis i didn't see it my wife saw it she
01:15:04.880 described to me i know what it is i said
01:15:06.719 that's an act she's like
01:15:07.600 it was like it had white spots like a
01:15:09.520 fawn but it was really big i'm like
01:15:11.040 that's an access deer
01:15:12.480 so there's axis deer yeah they're
01:15:14.400 they're from india okay and tigers eat
01:15:16.400 them
01:15:17.040 okay emily wow but these animals are
01:15:20.159 they're wild here because people bought
01:15:22.320 them and they they put them in their
01:15:23.840 yard then they jump the fence
01:15:25.520 this place is crazy but that's why it
01:15:28.080 works
01:15:28.960 the reason why it works is because
01:15:30.560 people have so much freedom
01:15:32.239 yeah and then you have the university of
01:15:34.960 texas you have
01:15:36.320 austin which is a long history of art
01:15:38.480 and music stevie ray vaughan and
01:15:40.719 sixth street and so many great musicians
01:15:42.480 have come from here that it's got both
01:15:44.239 of these things together it's got this
01:15:46.080 wild freedom and they embrace both parts
01:15:49.360 of it
01:15:50.080 you know this is that's the cool thing
01:15:51.520 about this place yeah yeah absolutely
01:15:53.840 i've never felt more at home i [ __ ]
01:15:55.679 love it here that's a cool city
01:15:58.320 um like i said it's gonna be the biggest
01:15:59.679 broom town in that america scene in
01:16:02.159 i have 50 years ago i agree yeah yeah
01:16:05.520 i think so mega boom comedy clubs are
01:16:07.840 moving here like crazy
01:16:09.600 they're moving here left and right cap
01:16:10.880 city's reopening the creek and the cave
01:16:12.560 just announced they're going to open
01:16:13.600 here
01:16:13.920 that's cool i'm trying to open up a
01:16:15.120 place here there's other other clubs of
01:16:16.800 trying to open up here
01:16:17.840 comedians are moving in here by the
01:16:19.360 droves it's a wild place
01:16:22.239 yeah well yeah i went to uh you and
01:16:25.840 dave chapelle it was that was great it
01:16:28.320 was fun that's a great venue
01:16:29.679 yeah we did that monday and tuesday too
01:16:31.280 that's cool it's
01:16:32.880 it's just there's something special
01:16:34.640 going on it just feels fun
01:16:36.239 it feels fun to be a part of the escape
01:16:38.719 from
01:16:39.280 this wretched dreariness of of
01:16:42.880 you know the covid pandemic it was just
01:16:44.719 like this horrible feeling of having no
01:16:47.360 power and no autonomy and being
01:16:49.280 controlled by the government
01:16:50.800 and being told what to do and it didn't
01:16:52.400 seem logical and you're watching all
01:16:53.679 these businesses fail
01:16:55.040 and you're like there's got to be a
01:16:56.239 better way and like there is no better
01:16:57.600 way wear an extra mask
01:16:58.800 three masks wear three masks and stay
01:17:01.920 indoors
01:17:02.560 and holy [ __ ] yeah yeah it didn't make
01:17:05.760 any sense
01:17:06.719 no um
01:17:09.760 you can't talk people out of a good
01:17:10.960 panic they sure love it
01:17:12.960 they love panic porn yeah fear porn
01:17:16.000 is like that's people's favorite
01:17:17.600 indulgence yeah that's why i say rule
01:17:19.679 number one
01:17:20.320 just like douglas adams don't panic but
01:17:22.960 there's always people that
01:17:24.159 that don't and those people they get
01:17:26.560 together and they
01:17:28.000 they take solace in the fact there's
01:17:29.520 other people that also don't want to buy
01:17:31.520 into this [ __ ]
01:17:32.719 do you know yeah um
01:17:36.080 anyway so orson's origin is cool um so
01:17:38.640 the cyber truck
01:17:39.840 yeah so we're gonna build it uh
01:17:42.880 our our factories only like two miles
01:17:44.080 away from the airport oh um
01:17:46.159 probably shouldn't tell people that no i
01:17:47.840 mean you can literally drive you can see
01:17:49.280 it
01:17:49.600 from the highway do you do you
01:17:51.920 anticipate visitors
01:17:53.679 sure i mean we'll we'll offer tours and
01:17:55.840 that kind of thing will you offer
01:17:57.040 like if someone wants to come and get
01:17:58.719 their truck from the factory to drive it
01:18:00.480 off the floor
01:18:01.120 you better that's exciting yeah that's
01:18:03.920 exciting
01:18:04.320 we got a lot of land yeah no no 2500
01:18:07.920 acres
01:18:08.400 uh right next to the airport that's
01:18:09.840 [ __ ] cool yeah that's amazing
01:18:12.400 it's cool so when you're designing
01:18:16.159 this cyber truck you know you had your
01:18:18.880 your launch you showed the shape of it
01:18:20.560 there was a lot like i sent you a
01:18:21.679 picture i remember i sent you a picture
01:18:23.280 i was like this is [ __ ] cool and
01:18:24.480 you're like that's not real
01:18:25.679 and i was like oh okay like there's a
01:18:28.159 lot of fake pictures
01:18:29.600 before the initial launch oh yeah you
01:18:32.080 tricked a lot of people because
01:18:34.159 people thought it was going to look much
01:18:37.120 even though the the picture that i sent
01:18:38.640 you was
01:18:39.199 pretty [ __ ] cool yeah what you
01:18:41.440 designed was
01:18:42.960 is that ultimately going to be what it
01:18:44.480 really looks like is it going to be
01:18:46.000 that shape has there been any revisions
01:18:50.320 no that's pretty much what it'll look
01:18:51.600 like with very small differences
01:18:54.800 um you know we adjusted the size a few
01:18:57.440 percent
01:18:58.239 um but uh in what way
01:19:02.080 well we it's a i don't know like i think
01:19:04.000 around three percent smaller
01:19:06.000 why why'd you decide to do that
01:19:09.040 uh well you know to be a couple inches
01:19:10.560 too big for the tunnel
01:19:12.239 oh okay so for the boring tunnel
01:19:15.840 well i mean we did actually drive
01:19:18.960 through the pouring tunnel in a cyber
01:19:21.040 truck with jay leno
01:19:22.480 which was a hair raising because it was
01:19:24.960 a little bit too big it was
01:19:26.400 pretty snug oh no imagine if you killed
01:19:29.280 jay leno
01:19:30.239 yeah that'd be awkward
01:19:33.840 how do we ever explain that he's the
01:19:35.600 biggest petrol head ever and he even
01:19:37.360 loves your car
01:19:38.239 yeah the cyber truck is like cgi in real
01:19:41.120 life
01:19:42.719 it looks you're standing right in front
01:19:44.159 of it and it looks like uh this is
01:19:46.400 special effect so that's cool it'll
01:19:50.239 it'll change the look of the roads that
01:19:52.400 look like anything it looks like alien
01:19:53.679 technology
01:19:54.320 yeah and when is that coming out um
01:19:57.440 we'll we'll have probably limited
01:19:58.960 production end of this year and volume
01:20:00.880 production hopefully next year
01:20:02.560 have you ever considered something
01:20:04.400 alternative to
01:20:05.760 uh air inflated tires have you seen some
01:20:08.239 of these
01:20:09.360 these alternatives that have essentially
01:20:11.840 spaces
01:20:12.560 in between the upper wall and the wheel
01:20:15.040 have you thought about that
01:20:16.320 yeah we've had we haven't found a
01:20:19.520 you know uh a tire that
01:20:23.920 because you gotta worry about road noise
01:20:26.639 uh you gotta
01:20:27.679 take out potholes and bumps
01:20:30.719 um you gotta have like a
01:20:33.760 good grip but you also want to have low
01:20:35.760 rolling resistance so that you know you
01:20:37.440 get good range
01:20:39.040 those are a lot of things to try to put
01:20:41.520 into one
01:20:43.199 tire then if you also say and it can't
01:20:46.080 have air
01:20:47.040 it's like this is hard um so you're
01:20:50.000 talking
01:20:50.639 i'm talking to a guy who's putting
01:20:52.400 people on mars
01:20:53.840 you can't figure out an airless tire
01:20:56.400 it's just
01:20:56.880 it's it's an incremental constraint um
01:21:00.800 so i'm not saying there won't be such a
01:21:02.400 thing i think there will be too precise
01:21:04.560 because it seems like we've just gotten
01:21:06.239 way too comfortable with this idea that
01:21:07.679 tires blow out
01:21:09.120 and you get flats it's very annoying
01:21:11.600 that's annoying yeah
01:21:12.960 very annoying yeah um
01:21:17.520 in non-sport tires by the way i'm much
01:21:19.120 less likely to go to have flats because
01:21:20.960 they're sure
01:21:21.360 they're more bounce yeah i like you
01:21:23.199 let's say you hit you hit the edge of a
01:21:24.480 pothole
01:21:25.600 if you've got more rubber wall you know
01:21:27.760 you've got a longer way to go before
01:21:29.199 you pinch the tire so um
01:21:33.280 sport tires tend to that have more flats
01:21:36.400 um and especially in l.a potholes that's
01:21:38.800 the worst yeah
01:21:39.840 like there was one particular pothole on
01:21:41.520 sunset boulevard
01:21:43.360 they would just take out so many model s
01:21:45.920 like boom boom both sides of the car
01:21:48.080 really yeah damn
01:21:51.520 um yeah steven spielberg was actually
01:21:54.560 once
01:21:55.360 it's like hey steven's people focus like
01:21:59.360 two tires went i was like god damn it i
01:22:00.880 know that pothole
01:22:01.880 [Laughter]
01:22:06.000 i feel like you can pay to fix that i
01:22:07.920 mean fix that pothole it seems like that
01:22:09.840 that's actually
01:22:10.719 it'll be like man there sure a lot of
01:22:12.400 taxes in california for roads this bad
01:22:14.320 yeah the place is a mess
01:22:17.520 yeah um so so ultimately one day that's
01:22:20.960 a possibility of having some sort of an
01:22:22.480 airless tire because i've seen
01:22:23.760 prototypes
01:22:24.639 i've never seen one on an actual car in
01:22:26.320 physical in
01:22:27.679 in real life yeah i think we're the
01:22:29.120 technology is gradually getting there
01:22:31.199 um and i think for something like a robo
01:22:33.840 taxi
01:22:34.480 where you want to have the tires last
01:22:36.400 for a long time and not go flat
01:22:38.080 um it's gonna make a lot of sense yeah
01:22:41.120 um but other than that essentially
01:22:44.480 most of what we saw in the demo is the
01:22:47.199 same it's still gonna have
01:22:48.719 now oh yeah there was the issue with the
01:22:50.880 glass when
01:22:52.159 yeah that accidentally shot that how
01:22:54.639 annoying was that
01:22:56.400 that was shocking yeah i mean
01:22:59.440 we literally spent you know hours
01:23:02.159 beforehand with like
01:23:03.440 lots of people throwing uh steel balls
01:23:06.560 at the window right um i mean we must
01:23:09.760 have thrown
01:23:10.320 at least at least a dozen people must
01:23:12.800 have thrown
01:23:13.360 steel balls at the same window though
01:23:14.960 yes isn't that the problem
01:23:16.800 yeah that might turns out that might be
01:23:18.480 the problem
01:23:20.480 if you keep throwing steel balls
01:23:21.840 eventually it's going to break
01:23:24.159 and i did i did ask franz to really wind
01:23:27.040 up and give it all
01:23:28.400 you know and i should she was sort of
01:23:30.320 like oh take it easy yeah you know give
01:23:32.400 me
01:23:32.800 you don't need to wind up yeah we don't
01:23:34.480 need the fastball
01:23:35.840 but i asked for i did ask for the
01:23:37.199 fastball and like okay let's go for the
01:23:39.280 slightly not slightly slower ball do you
01:23:41.440 think it was because you guys were
01:23:42.560 hitting the sidewall with a sledgehammer
01:23:44.639 yeah yeah
01:23:45.120 that could be like we're trying to
01:23:47.199 figure out how the hell this thing break
01:23:48.480 because
01:23:49.360 i mean we were just bouncing steel balls
01:23:51.199 off it all day right um
01:23:53.040 and we think possibly what what might
01:23:55.840 have happened there
01:23:56.800 was that uh hitting it with a
01:23:58.400 sledgehammer might have cracked the base
01:24:00.080 of it
01:24:00.560 and once you crack the base of it it
01:24:01.920 loses all the strength right um and then
01:24:04.560 it and then we just have a hairline
01:24:06.320 fracture and then then you
01:24:07.920 hit he hit it anywhere it's gonna
01:24:09.040 shatter did you recreate that
01:24:12.080 we didn't um it's also hard with uh
01:24:16.320 test glass like with uh you know that
01:24:18.560 like when you actually do production
01:24:20.159 glass
01:24:20.719 it's much more robust than uh demo glass
01:24:24.320 uh because production glass you you you
01:24:27.920 um like demo glasses you just can't make
01:24:32.320 you you have to have like
01:24:33.440 massive tools and ovens and everything
01:24:35.199 to to make the production glass it's
01:24:36.800 it's like
01:24:38.080 and if you don't you know that takes a
01:24:40.320 while to do
01:24:41.360 so the production class is always better
01:24:43.360 than than
01:24:44.800 than demo glass nonetheless it should
01:24:47.920 have worked
01:24:48.880 um and it was probably because we
01:24:51.199 whacked it with a sledgehammer and then
01:24:52.800 threw the steel ball at it
01:24:56.840 but uh it will be bulletproof to a
01:24:59.040 handgun now why did you decide to do all
01:25:01.600 that
01:25:01.920 make it bulletproof and make it like you
01:25:04.000 could hit it with a sledgehammer like
01:25:05.440 what
01:25:05.760 what was the motivation to make it
01:25:07.120 different than just like a model s
01:25:09.360 i mean i think you know it's like what's
01:25:11.199 cool about a truck trucks are tough
01:25:12.800 and like okay what's tougher than a
01:25:14.159 truck a tank what about a tank from the
01:25:15.840 future
01:25:16.390 [Laughter]
01:25:17.840 okay now you have a tank from the future
01:25:20.560 okay
01:25:21.280 yeah that's bulletproof yeah and
01:25:24.960 how's that compared to you know it was
01:25:28.080 way tougher
01:25:29.120 than a regular truck look it's [ __ ]
01:25:31.520 cool yeah there's no doubt that i don't
01:25:32.880 have some
01:25:33.360 character from the future being like a
01:25:35.199 halo with a rocket launcher in the back
01:25:37.440 have you thought about doing something
01:25:38.400 like that somebody's gonna do it for
01:25:40.159 sure for military use yeah
01:25:41.920 seems like it i mean i don't know that
01:25:43.440 sounds like it'd be fun like
01:25:45.520 you know cruising around the field and
01:25:46.880 like lobbying shooting rockets
01:25:49.920 now is there ever a possibility that
01:25:52.000 these things gonna be solar powered is
01:25:54.080 that
01:25:54.320 is that someday is the solar technology
01:25:56.880 going to get to a point where
01:25:58.239 it's kind of a surface area issue so i
01:25:59.840 mean i think we could possibly put the
01:26:02.080 the cover of the truck bed um you know
01:26:05.280 put some solar cells in that so if you
01:26:06.639 just leave it out in the sun
01:26:08.000 you know probably bring you know
01:26:10.080 recharges a few miles a day type of
01:26:11.840 thing
01:26:13.120 it was only it would only be a few
01:26:14.320 months but what about one day
01:26:16.480 is it possible the technology could
01:26:18.080 evolve to the point where they could
01:26:19.280 extract
01:26:19.920 no really no it's a so there's about
01:26:23.600 one kilowatt per square meter of solar
01:26:26.239 energy and then
01:26:27.360 you're gonna get uh probably 20 25
01:26:30.400 efficiency so you got 200 watts of
01:26:31.920 square meter and then that's assuming
01:26:34.000 that you're normal to the sun
01:26:35.760 so you know like you're you know at the
01:26:38.320 right angles basically like
01:26:39.679 are you facing the sun or not so
01:26:43.600 you know we add all those things up you
01:26:45.040 say how many square meters can you
01:26:46.000 really get
01:26:46.960 and then how many watt hours per mile
01:26:50.080 so it is basically
01:26:53.600 if you could do 10 miles a day you'd be
01:26:55.360 lucky really
01:26:56.880 yeah and that's not going to change no
01:27:00.480 wow that sucks it'd be cool if it just
01:27:04.480 ran i mean is it possible to make a car
01:27:06.960 entirely of solar panels
01:27:08.800 like the the entire surface of it solar
01:27:10.960 panels like in a place like
01:27:12.400 la or somewhere where it's never cloudy
01:27:15.760 and drive around that thing
01:27:18.800 now you can only you're going to burn
01:27:20.239 off energy faster you can drive
01:27:21.840 if you don't drive that often that's a
01:27:23.120 different story the only option is to
01:27:24.960 have a solar paneled home
01:27:26.320 and extract the power that way and
01:27:28.080 charging room
01:27:29.600 how's it going a lot of area yeah so
01:27:33.600 um now you could possibly have like some
01:27:37.440 you know solar thing that unfurls uh
01:27:40.480 that
01:27:40.880 has a lot more surface area so when you
01:27:42.960 park it at work or something like that
01:27:44.480 yeah
01:27:46.080 but it just needs area right you know so
01:27:50.000 like i said you know think about like
01:27:51.280 maybe 200 watts a square meter
01:27:54.639 uh you know maybe 20 watts a square foot
01:27:57.280 something like that
01:27:58.800 now the range of the new cars is much
01:28:02.239 longer um like what is the range of uh
01:28:06.320 the standard model s that's available
01:28:08.080 right now it's like 300 and
01:28:10.800 yeah 350 360. i don't know it's a lot um
01:28:13.760 and
01:28:14.239 actually the new one the new uh
01:28:15.840 long-range model s is over 400 mile
01:28:17.760 range
01:28:18.400 the new one but actually even the old
01:28:20.239 one the old one was even 400 miles
01:28:22.000 the new one's 400 miles too but the
01:28:23.840 plaid will get you up to
01:28:26.159 so the current plaid is going to be
01:28:28.400 around 400 miles range
01:28:30.159 uh there's a plat plus if you
01:28:33.520 that's maybe a year from now that'll be
01:28:36.400 on the order of 500 miles
01:28:37.840 um that's a lot i here drive 500 miles
01:28:40.239 anyway
01:28:41.360 well if you're driving across the
01:28:42.320 country yeah yeah pretty rare i mean
01:28:45.199 like
01:28:46.639 yeah for most commuters yeah
01:28:49.840 i mean even if you're driving 100 miles
01:28:52.320 an hour you know
01:28:53.199 like it's still you know uh you're still
01:28:55.920 gonna drive
01:28:56.480 drive for a while before you run out of
01:28:58.880 battery
01:28:59.760 and the truck what is the the cyber
01:29:01.920 trucks range gonna be
01:29:04.400 um we have to pick a range actually for
01:29:06.560 the initial version
01:29:08.840 um it'll be some number over 300 miles
01:29:12.960 now when you say pick a range is it in
01:29:14.960 terms of like what
01:29:16.480 the battery array that you put in next
01:29:18.560 like what's the pack size
01:29:19.600 so do you have to take into account like
01:29:21.760 like how much weight
01:29:22.880 it's going to add how long it's going to
01:29:24.719 take to charge
01:29:26.320 yeah um i mean there's like basically
01:29:29.280 the things that matter
01:29:30.480 are the frontal area times the drag
01:29:32.800 coefficient
01:29:34.159 for aerodynamic drag and then rolling
01:29:36.320 resistance
01:29:37.600 which is a function of mass and the tire
01:29:40.159 efficiency
01:29:42.639 so this this this has a big frontal area
01:29:46.560 it's not very aerodynamic and the tires
01:29:49.760 are
01:29:50.239 not super uh they're not not optimized
01:29:53.600 for
01:29:53.920 long range it looks very aerodynamic the
01:29:56.400 truck
01:29:57.600 like if i actually have a [ __ ] you
01:29:59.360 don't want your angles you don't want
01:30:00.719 sharp angles
01:30:01.440 see that's the problem it looks to me
01:30:03.360 i'll be like yeah that's slicing right
01:30:04.800 through like a knife
01:30:06.800 um you want it rounded you want it
01:30:10.239 around it
01:30:10.719 yeah um so you want the air to have like
01:30:14.560 smooth
01:30:15.440 like if you're a little air particle you
01:30:17.760 don't want the bumps
01:30:18.880 right you want to like smooth just like
01:30:21.199 you're driving over the car
01:30:22.800 no bumps right just just you know easy
01:30:26.000 going
01:30:27.199 sharp sharp angles are bad for arrow so
01:30:29.760 that arrow will
01:30:30.800 contribute to the lack of range so it'll
01:30:34.400 minimize the range somewhat it'll have a
01:30:36.320 drag coefficient that's pretty good for
01:30:37.840 a truck
01:30:39.440 um because the enclosing the bed
01:30:42.639 at an angle that helps a lot like normal
01:30:44.960 trucks going down the
01:30:46.080 highway it's like a barn door right i
01:30:48.080 know right i mean
01:30:49.679 it's like having a parachute in the back
01:30:51.120 you might as well be flying it yeah
01:30:53.040 it's like not not far different from
01:30:55.199 driving with a parachute
01:30:56.400 yeah um so you can think of like drag is
01:30:58.880 basically it's like the integrated
01:30:59.920 pressure profile over the car
01:31:01.600 so if you create a low pressure zone uh
01:31:04.560 in the back of your car
01:31:05.920 uh where you don't like fill in the gap
01:31:08.159 like you're cruising through the air
01:31:09.760 you're making a hole through the air and
01:31:11.199 the air is trying to fill in the gap
01:31:13.120 and if you've got if you've got like a
01:31:15.120 sharp you know sharp transition
01:31:17.760 into the truck bed it's like it's a big
01:31:19.520 low pressure zone basically
01:31:21.280 um and that's uh that's bad for drag
01:31:26.239 um so having the slope back where
01:31:29.600 where that's got the the truck bed cover
01:31:33.360 um that's it that's very helpful
01:31:36.400 but the sharp angles are not helpful so
01:31:38.239 the range of that truck
01:31:39.760 is yet to be determined you're trying to
01:31:43.199 figure it out
01:31:44.000 man it'll be over 300 miles what about
01:31:45.840 the roadster
01:31:48.000 um
01:31:54.000 i mean some of these things we got to
01:31:55.440 decide like what's actually the best
01:31:58.080 product you know what how much range do
01:32:00.480 you really want you know
01:32:02.159 um if you ask people i say well i want
01:32:06.159 you know 600 miles range i'm like okay
01:32:08.000 well
01:32:09.280 that that means most of the time you're
01:32:10.719 hauling around a battery pack you're not
01:32:12.159 going to use
01:32:13.280 you know so and it'll slow you down
01:32:15.360 it'll yeah inhibit handling yeah it's
01:32:17.679 like
01:32:18.239 otherwise like why not have a car that's
01:32:19.520 got a fuel tank that has two thousand
01:32:20.960 miles range
01:32:21.679 then i go and pull it up like once every
01:32:24.000 every six months or
01:32:25.120 every three months or something right
01:32:26.719 but people they they basically figured
01:32:28.560 out like actually carrying that much
01:32:30.239 that much fuel around it's not not yeah
01:32:32.880 it's not
01:32:33.520 worth it right so um
01:32:37.600 so i think you know there's some other
01:32:39.120 stuff you can do for kind of like
01:32:40.400 bragging rights and like
01:32:41.520 but then you know brainwashing's going
01:32:43.360 to get old fast so
01:32:44.639 it's more like what are you going to
01:32:46.239 like on a day-to-day basis
01:32:48.080 what's like what maximizes the area
01:32:49.760 under the curve of owner happiness
01:32:52.320 so it'll have enough range that you'll
01:32:54.880 never have to worry about range let me
01:32:56.239 put it that way
01:32:57.440 um okay yeah so someone
01:33:00.639 can drive from l.a to san francisco no
01:33:02.560 problem austin to dallas no problem
01:33:05.840 so a few hours of driving easy many
01:33:08.320 hours of driving many hours of driving
01:33:10.400 now i i heard you talk recently about uh
01:33:13.199 the possibility of a van
01:33:15.199 like sprinter van style yeah now
01:33:18.800 a band um because you got a big flat
01:33:21.840 area that's actually where solar could
01:33:25.440 start to
01:33:26.639 make a little more sense you know
01:33:28.880 because you could have a lot of area
01:33:30.480 so for the roof yeah and i think you
01:33:34.239 also have like
01:33:35.120 maybe a roof where you know it's solar
01:33:37.440 and then when it's stationary
01:33:39.520 like like maybe mornings yeah it like it
01:33:42.480 goes out and like provides shade and and
01:33:44.480 maybe triples your area or something
01:33:45.760 like that
01:33:46.480 now if you go like okay now triple a
01:33:48.239 area and you've got a big flat surface
01:33:51.280 um now you could start having
01:33:54.320 maybe having charging enough that you
01:33:57.040 you can start getting like 30 miles a
01:33:58.639 day
01:33:59.280 that kind of thing well that's
01:34:00.239 interesting because there's a lot of
01:34:01.199 people that use those for camping
01:34:02.880 yeah like my friend tom green you know
01:34:04.960 tom green
01:34:06.000 he's i think so yeah he used to be on
01:34:07.840 mtv and
01:34:09.440 actor and comedian he's uh traveling
01:34:12.000 across the country right now in
01:34:13.280 one of those vans like style van i think
01:34:15.840 he got a ram a dodge ram
01:34:17.760 sprinter van style yeah and uh if you
01:34:20.639 had something like that
01:34:21.760 he has an awning that extends and he's
01:34:23.600 got a bunch of camping and he does a
01:34:25.760 podcast
01:34:26.400 out of it if you had something like that
01:34:28.880 it's it's i think that would be
01:34:30.239 great you know like you could have like
01:34:32.400 a van that just
01:34:33.520 you know even if if the apocalypse came
01:34:35.280 around you still you can still drive
01:34:37.120 yeah yeah and maybe you can even have
01:34:39.679 some sort of uh
01:34:40.800 an external tent that you could set up
01:34:43.040 that's just a solar tent
01:34:44.400 yeah that could juice you up during the
01:34:47.280 day or something
01:34:48.080 something along those lines yeah
01:34:51.119 for solar it's all about area yeah yeah
01:34:53.520 it's called 200
01:34:54.719 watts a square meter maybe 20 watts a
01:34:56.400 square foot something like that and but
01:34:58.080 i don't understand that this there's no
01:34:59.679 way that that's ever gonna get more
01:35:00.800 efficient
01:35:03.119 no really no i mean
01:35:07.040 the sun the solar incidence um
01:35:10.400 is somewhat coincidentally
01:35:13.520 roughly a thousand watts per square
01:35:15.760 meter
01:35:16.880 or you know uh in a hundred you know
01:35:20.560 in a ten foot by oh sorry sorry i'd like
01:35:23.600 it ten square feet ish um
01:35:27.600 there's a thousand watts um
01:35:30.719 and then that that that includes all the
01:35:33.600 heating and everything else so so then
01:35:34.800 you say like okay
01:35:35.920 for photoelectric effect you're only
01:35:38.480 you're going to capture photons within a
01:35:40.080 certain band and
01:35:42.960 you're not going to get them all because
01:35:46.000 basically what happens with the the
01:35:47.440 photon you know hits the electron
01:35:50.400 and gets it to jump over a gap and run
01:35:52.719 around to the other side that's what
01:35:54.000 happens with
01:35:54.560 the photoelectric effect it's just
01:35:57.679 it hits a just it
01:36:00.880 hits the hit photon with the right
01:36:02.800 energy hits the electron
01:36:05.119 electron gets excited jumps over a gap
01:36:07.679 in the semiconductor
01:36:08.719 and races around to the other side
01:36:10.320 that's the electro and then thus creates
01:36:11.760 an electric circuit
01:36:14.080 so you say okay well how are you going
01:36:16.880 to get those
01:36:18.560 uh you know electrons it's just the
01:36:22.000 right energy what like what's what kind
01:36:23.760 of
01:36:24.000 photon incoming energy you've got i was
01:36:26.159 like yeah it basically pretty much tops
01:36:28.400 out around 30
01:36:30.239 efficiency for a silicon system now if
01:36:32.719 you have triple gun junction gallium
01:36:34.239 arsenide
01:36:35.040 you do a lot better but that's very
01:36:37.280 expensive
01:36:38.960 so but if you're talking about like how
01:36:41.360 much better could it do
01:36:42.800 yeah like uh mid 30s maybe 40
01:36:46.639 before a big price increase but still
01:36:49.440 not enough to actually power the entire
01:36:51.040 vehicle
01:36:52.400 no no you're talking about any fc like
01:36:54.719 for practical purposes
01:36:57.199 how's it going to do um
01:37:00.560 because you can't have like crazy money
01:37:01.920 stuff in a car you know when you say big
01:37:03.840 money like
01:37:04.480 like how much more like 10 times the
01:37:06.719 cost at least
01:37:07.520 oh wow yeah i mean you don't see anyone
01:37:10.400 i mean the only thing
01:37:11.520 like this uh satellites that have like
01:37:13.199 the treble junction gallium last night
01:37:14.719 stuff you know but
01:37:15.760 frankly even for satellites is
01:37:17.040 questionable um for our satellites for
01:37:19.600 starlink we don't bother with that
01:37:21.199 that's another thing i want to talk to
01:37:22.159 you about scarlet style
01:37:23.600 starlink uh starlink is
01:37:27.400 semi-controversial right because on one
01:37:29.600 hand people think it's great
01:37:31.199 that you're going to provide the
01:37:33.199 internet through these uh satellites
01:37:34.719 that are flying around
01:37:35.520 sure but astronomers and a lot of people
01:37:38.000 that are
01:37:38.560 you know amateur astronomers mostly the
01:37:41.199 amateurs
01:37:41.920 i think we've talked with the the
01:37:45.199 the professional astronomers and assuage
01:37:47.119 their concerns
01:37:48.320 yeah yeah but the amateurs are pissed
01:37:52.000 yeah they're like you know
01:37:55.280 the the the they don't know what they're
01:37:56.880 talking about they're pro-level guys
01:37:58.400 they know what they're talking about um
01:38:01.199 so
01:38:03.280 um we'll make sure that this is not like
01:38:06.000 an obstacle to science
01:38:08.560 so what the obstacle would be the visual
01:38:11.119 aspect of it right the
01:38:12.400 seeing these things flying around that
01:38:15.199 would be it
01:38:17.280 yeah honestly it's pretty hard to find
01:38:18.800 our satellites once they've reached
01:38:20.080 orbit
01:38:20.560 it's hard to find them and we have
01:38:22.080 trouble finding our satellites they're
01:38:23.760 like we're like
01:38:24.400 oh we got like but i've seen pictures of
01:38:26.320 them yeah
01:38:28.159 well first of all so during the initial
01:38:32.400 like when they get tossed out of the
01:38:34.239 rocket briefly
01:38:36.400 uh they're tumbling um and so when
01:38:39.280 they're tumbling they'll twinkle
01:38:40.719 and then and then you'll see them oh so
01:38:42.960 this was just the initial
01:38:44.159 yeah it's just the initial orbit they
01:38:45.840 just got tossed out of the
01:38:47.920 you know with upper stage deploys the
01:38:50.080 way we deploy them
01:38:51.520 we don't even really have a separation
01:38:52.800 mechanism you can see the video online
01:38:54.400 uh but we kind of time down like a
01:38:56.480 bundle of hay and then we
01:38:59.760 let go of the rods that are holding this
01:39:01.520 big bundle of satellites down
01:39:03.119 but before that we rotate the stage so
01:39:05.280 the stage is rotating
01:39:06.639 and and the satellites get just like if
01:39:09.199 you took a deck of cards
01:39:10.800 and those all get thrown out with
01:39:12.960 because they have different
01:39:14.320 amounts of rotational inertia so
01:39:17.840 and what kind of bandwidth are these
01:39:19.119 going to provide oh so
01:39:22.880 yeah i mean i think long term long term
01:39:25.440 we're talking about
01:39:26.000 gigabit level really yeah gigabit low
01:39:28.239 latency so you can play like a fast
01:39:29.760 twitch video game
01:39:31.199 uh download a movie super fast um it'd
01:39:34.080 be great
01:39:34.960 and this is going to be global yeah and
01:39:38.080 it
01:39:38.320 is it global by the satellites that
01:39:40.080 you've already launched initially or
01:39:42.000 will require
01:39:43.360 a series of satellites in in different
01:39:45.600 parts of the country or different parts
01:39:46.960 of the world
01:39:48.400 well these satellites are actually
01:39:49.520 zooming around the earth at 25 times the
01:39:51.040 speed of sound
01:39:52.320 and there's currently 36 planes uh
01:39:55.600 which so they're they're i mean to
01:39:58.800 to the satellite the satellite feels
01:40:00.480 like it's going in a circle
01:40:02.239 um but the earth's rotating underneath
01:40:03.920 the satellite so the ground track
01:40:06.000 looks like a sine wave so that if you if
01:40:08.320 you look say like the
01:40:09.440 from the ground perspective the
01:40:10.639 satellite's doing this like sine wave
01:40:13.199 with a peak at 53 degrees and then
01:40:16.000 there's
01:40:16.719 there's there's 36 planes so they're all
01:40:18.400 doing like a sine wave
01:40:19.920 you know uh just offset by a little bit
01:40:23.840 um and
01:40:26.960 but but like i said like space is real
01:40:29.679 big
01:40:30.400 so they're not in danger of whacking it
01:40:32.239 into each other it's super big up there
01:40:34.840 um they don't really even get close
01:40:37.760 so anyway so they're zooming around
01:40:40.560 earth
01:40:41.520 um as we got a lot of coverage around 53
01:40:44.320 degrees
01:40:45.040 um and then we just started to launch
01:40:48.239 some polar satellites which will uh go
01:40:51.119 have a orbital inclination that's that
01:40:53.280 allows them to
01:40:54.560 kind of go have visibility to the poles
01:40:57.440 almost
01:40:57.920 you know who the [ __ ] is that for
01:41:01.920 just in case i mean best people that
01:41:04.480 live up there you know
01:41:05.440 i guess a few yeah yeah there's
01:41:08.000 antarctic research stations
01:41:09.360 okay so they're going to have internet
01:41:11.040 access it's it's they're going to hack
01:41:13.040 they can play halo up there yeah they're
01:41:14.480 going to go from having trash for
01:41:15.600 internet to having incredible internet
01:41:17.199 wow
01:41:18.000 yeah so it'll be the whole world yeah
01:41:20.560 wow
01:41:22.480 wow yeah every everywhere on earth we'll
01:41:25.520 have
01:41:26.159 high bandwidth low latency internet
01:41:29.520 and will you be able to increase the
01:41:32.080 bandwidth
01:41:33.199 over time through software uh there's a
01:41:35.920 lot that can be improved with software
01:41:38.239 but but i should say that there's
01:41:39.760 there's going to be
01:41:41.679 a role for many different types of
01:41:43.360 connectivity so
01:41:44.880 starlink is great for low to medium
01:41:48.880 population density uh but
01:41:52.320 the satellites are actually not great
01:41:55.360 for high density urban
01:41:57.280 uh so you're actually better off having
01:41:59.199 5g for that
01:42:00.480 um really yeah because
01:42:03.520 that satellite's pretty far away right
01:42:05.119 yeah
01:42:06.560 so you got that satellite it's uh
01:42:11.280 over 500 kilometers away even if it's
01:42:13.280 right above you um
01:42:15.040 on a slant distance it's like could be
01:42:17.280 you know uh
01:42:18.239 upwards of a thousand a thousand
01:42:19.520 kilometers away so so this would be
01:42:21.199 fantastic for rural
01:42:22.560 areas yeah it will provide
01:42:26.159 some kind of amount of connectivity
01:42:29.280 in urban environment dense urban
01:42:30.639 environments but um
01:42:32.560 equivalent to like what 3g
01:42:35.600 no it's more like so i think like
01:42:37.280 basically like what's the spot size of a
01:42:39.280 satellite
01:42:40.000 like when it's putting a beam down in a
01:42:41.760 location and how how big is that beam
01:42:44.880 um and that's that's that's it's so it's
01:42:47.280 got a certain amount of bandwidth
01:42:48.960 for that beam and that that beam is just
01:42:51.440 like it's a pretty big i think like a
01:42:53.199 flashlight or something
01:42:54.159 right and what is it it's the same thing
01:42:55.679 it's just it reaches a few blocks
01:42:57.760 like if you had a flashlight up there
01:42:59.600 and you're pointing down it's like okay
01:43:01.199 you're going to illuminate an area right
01:43:03.360 um
01:43:04.719 so flashlight's just shooting out photo
01:43:06.320 photons in the visible spectrum
01:43:08.159 um we're shooting out photons in the k
01:43:10.800 uk event
01:43:11.840 um so um much bigger wavelength than
01:43:15.679 light
01:43:16.239 than visible light um so
01:43:20.400 anyway so these things um so we got we
01:43:23.920 got a bunch of spot beams basically
01:43:25.760 um and and but that's these beams are
01:43:29.119 giant
01:43:29.679 by cellular standards like they might be
01:43:33.280 you know several miles uh diameter
01:43:37.520 on on that beam so then you got you know
01:43:41.040 say for argument's sake 10 mile diameter
01:43:43.440 you know 16 kilometer diameter
01:43:45.679 uh beam that's this is a lot of area
01:43:48.000 that's
01:43:48.880 and and all of the all those terminals
01:43:52.000 in that area will get the same
01:43:53.280 information because it's got that that
01:43:54.560 beam that's just going down
01:43:55.600 that spot so
01:43:58.639 um whereas you could have like a 5g
01:44:02.400 uh tower that's uh the ones that aren't
01:44:05.360 causing corona
01:44:06.560 um
01:44:11.840 kidding
01:44:15.280 5g courses corona it's a fact oh my god
01:44:18.080 have you seen any of that stuff
01:44:20.800 that's one of the most disturbing things
01:44:22.239 about the internet
01:44:24.159 anyway well i mean when technology is
01:44:25.840 magic then you don't know what to
01:44:26.880 believe
01:44:27.360 right and when you're a [ __ ] you
01:44:28.880 believe anything
01:44:29.550 [Laughter]
01:44:32.880 well let's say so uh a cell tower could
01:44:36.400 have a range of
01:44:37.600 um you know a mile or
01:44:41.280 you know miles one and a half kilometers
01:44:44.080 um
01:44:45.679 it basically could have like uh one
01:44:48.800 percent the area of
01:44:50.639 of a satellite beam so like if you had
01:44:53.520 something that was
01:44:55.520 about um you know one mile or
01:44:59.040 five minutes a kilometer or two or ten
01:45:03.119 it's going to be the square of that that
01:45:05.040 is the area so
01:45:07.040 uh satellites are what are great
01:45:10.560 for low to medium
01:45:13.960 density uh 5g
01:45:16.719 is ideal for high density i say yeah
01:45:20.159 and also because you could distribute
01:45:22.000 the towers
01:45:23.600 every mile or so easily and yes yeah and
01:45:26.719 dress them up like trees that always
01:45:28.480 bothers me i'd rather i think they
01:45:30.800 should do better at the fake trees
01:45:33.119 i feel like come on somebody didn't care
01:45:35.040 enough uh you could definitely have a
01:45:36.320 way better fake tree than that
01:45:37.679 they're so bad they're so bad they look
01:45:39.679 terrible
01:45:40.960 who are they tricking no one no one
01:45:42.639 right no i'm not like what is this part
01:45:45.440 yeah they're offensive they're more
01:45:47.600 offensive than like the most ridiculous
01:45:49.360 fake tits
01:45:50.719 you know like the the big ones that look
01:45:52.320 like basketballs they
01:45:54.080 don't cleave them yeah they have no
01:45:56.080 shape that resembles a breast at all
01:45:58.719 but yeah yeah there's something weird
01:46:01.520 about them too it's like
01:46:03.040 i'm not offended by a tower
01:46:08.880 well the christmas tree part the bottom
01:46:10.480 was kind of sweet you could
01:46:11.920 put ornaments on it is that one at the
01:46:13.520 top right that palm tree one is that
01:46:15.600 fake
01:46:16.560 no that's a good fake effect left side
01:46:18.400 jamie yeah yeah
01:46:19.760 i'm sorry scroll keeps growing the palm
01:46:21.360 tree one looks pretty good is that real
01:46:23.280 yeah well that's kind of not bad okay
01:46:25.679 that's not bad yeah that one's pretty
01:46:27.119 good
01:46:27.679 it's not bad yeah if you were driving by
01:46:30.000 that that wouldn't be offensive
01:46:31.280 yeah but the the one in the middle is
01:46:32.960 not bad either that's kind of a pine
01:46:34.480 tree looking
01:46:35.360 like some sort of demented christmas
01:46:36.639 tree that's a tower
01:46:39.040 go back to the one you just had the that
01:46:41.440 far left
01:46:42.320 that's probably the most impressive the
01:46:44.000 one on the left-hand side
01:46:45.760 the the far left one because if you had
01:46:48.239 like a forest full of those like yeah
01:46:50.800 true you would just go these are just
01:46:52.239 like weirdly uh
01:46:54.239 trimmed trees yeah it's not that hard to
01:46:55.840 have a fake tree you could definitely
01:46:57.679 have a little bit of effort i don't need
01:46:59.360 that you know just like i don't need
01:47:01.040 when i pass by a telephone pole
01:47:03.440 i don't need to pretend it's something
01:47:04.719 different it's a [ __ ] cell phone
01:47:07.040 tower yep
01:47:08.080 who decided to make those things into
01:47:09.600 fake trees like when did this
01:47:11.280 become a precedent i don't know but
01:47:15.679 you can definitely make a fake tree that
01:47:17.360 is convincing
01:47:18.800 so maybe just put more effort in the
01:47:21.280 fakery
01:47:22.080 yeah or just make them look cool make
01:47:24.000 them look like robots
01:47:25.760 yeah yeah have a big ultraman out there
01:47:28.560 i mean some people are like really
01:47:29.760 worried about like cellphone towers
01:47:31.280 i'm thinking they cause like radiation
01:47:32.719 or something poisoning this is not true
01:47:35.199 yeah people are worried about 5g right
01:47:37.760 don't worry about it
01:47:38.639 no not at all i mean no
01:47:42.080 uh like let me put this way like if i
01:47:43.920 had cell phones if i had a helmet of
01:47:46.000 cell phones right
01:47:47.600 strap around around my head and around
01:47:50.800 my nuts i would not worry
01:47:52.560 yeah yeah i met a dude once who had ball
01:47:54.480 cancer who's convinced that his cell
01:47:55.840 phone
01:47:56.480 no was in his pocket and that's what
01:47:58.080 gave him ball cancer nope
01:47:59.840 no no okay sorry
01:48:04.000 yeah no it's not it's the cell phone is
01:48:06.080 not um
01:48:08.159 no um yes i didn't know this guy very
01:48:10.960 well but he was uh
01:48:12.239 pretty convinced meanwhile he kept the
01:48:14.320 phone on the same side he was one of
01:48:15.679 those dudes that had the phone on the
01:48:16.880 little hip okay
01:48:18.159 thing you know a little little little
01:48:20.719 bracket
01:48:21.360 on his hip kept his phone there even
01:48:23.600 after he killed one of his nuts in his
01:48:25.119 eyes
01:48:26.159 he's like wow he wants his phone well
01:48:27.679 damage is done
01:48:28.560 [Laughter]
01:48:30.080 your phone or your balls yeah he gave up
01:48:33.280 uh they got me um
01:48:38.560 yeah don't worry about phones not
01:48:40.000 causing cancer so there's
01:48:41.600 no concern whatsoever with the radiation
01:48:43.840 that's caused by those things
01:48:45.520 uh no first of all uh when people say
01:48:47.360 radiation they're
01:48:48.960 uh there's just like they're conflating
01:48:50.239 this uh you know term from like nuclear
01:48:52.719 you know bombs and like technically we
01:48:56.239 are currently bathed
01:48:57.679 in radiation right now the
01:49:01.040 this table has radiation right
01:49:02.400 everything produces radiation everything
01:49:04.560 everything is emitting photons all the
01:49:06.159 time
01:49:06.800 um so this is a question of what
01:49:09.360 wavelength
01:49:10.480 and uh if you have a very short
01:49:13.360 wavelength of high frequency photon
01:49:15.679 that is capable of uh causing dna damage
01:49:19.360 but we're talking about like ultraviolet
01:49:21.040 and beyond your phone is not even close
01:49:23.360 um so
01:49:26.480 yeah um and and then
01:49:30.159 the thing that really causes problems in
01:49:33.360 let's say a nuclear explosion are uh
01:49:36.080 alpha particles
01:49:37.440 so like basically helium nuclei so those
01:49:39.520 things will they're like tiny
01:49:40.719 cannonballs
01:49:41.679 so those will rip right through you it's
01:49:43.440 like if you guys shot with tiny
01:49:44.480 cannibals bad things would happen
01:49:46.480 so that's that's also called radiation
01:49:49.199 but it's really
01:49:50.159 particles so you don't want to be
01:49:52.080 bombarded with uh
01:49:53.599 high-speed helium nuclei that's going to
01:49:55.760 be bad how does that happen
01:49:57.679 well that happens in a nuclear explosion
01:49:59.360 oh yeah okay avoid those
01:50:01.599 yeah that's bad but cell phones are okay
01:50:04.400 yeah cell phones are not emitting
01:50:05.679 particles
01:50:06.320 so if it says like as my cell phone can
01:50:09.280 cause brain cancer
01:50:10.000 i'm like because of radiation like do
01:50:11.119 you mean photons or particles it's like
01:50:13.280 it's not emitting particles
01:50:14.480 so we can just put that aside don't
01:50:16.080 worry about the particles then the
01:50:17.360 photons that
01:50:18.159 are that's emitting uh the most they can
01:50:20.719 do
01:50:21.199 is slightly warm up your ear and only by
01:50:24.560 a tiny amount
01:50:25.760 it's like it's like okay if you had an
01:50:27.440 ear warmer
01:50:29.119 that was very mild that's your phone
01:50:33.520 that's all it's it's many photons at a
01:50:35.920 frequency that are
01:50:37.679 that that is it's a a frequency that can
01:50:41.679 that is not going to cause dna damage so
01:50:44.880 don't worry about it concerns people
01:50:46.320 leave the easy at night don't worry
01:50:47.679 about your phone
01:50:48.400 it's fine david ike does not believe you
01:50:50.800 he's doing backflips right
01:50:52.080 now you [ __ ] chill um
01:50:55.360 so what concerns people is the unknown
01:50:57.280 right they hear about 5g
01:50:59.040 and then they hear about radiation
01:51:00.320 they're like wait a minute should i is
01:51:02.159 this say what are we doing
01:51:03.679 are we just ruining everything we're
01:51:05.760 ruining it's fine
01:51:07.040 fine totally fine um thank you
01:51:10.239 yeah now i feel good about my 5g phone
01:51:13.119 if you had a helmet
01:51:14.320 that was made of cell phones you'll be
01:51:16.320 fine yeah but this is coming from a guy
01:51:18.000 who wants to stick a quarter-sized hole
01:51:19.599 in your head
01:51:20.000 and shove wires into your brain yeah so
01:51:22.480 i know if
01:51:23.040 a few things about what caused the brain
01:51:24.719 damage
01:51:26.560 i know but that like uh neural link
01:51:30.080 concerns the [ __ ] out of people that
01:51:31.599 that that that scares folks that's the
01:51:34.400 ultimate
01:51:35.760 i think it would be problematic if we
01:51:37.040 pinned you to the ground and put it in
01:51:39.119 yes i agree and said like okay you're
01:51:42.080 gonna get this
01:51:43.040 we're gonna chip you out whether you'll
01:51:44.320 like it or not the chip
01:51:47.520 that's the yeah thing that people are
01:51:48.480 scared of right now
01:51:51.840 you will have to sign a million
01:51:55.040 disclosures
01:51:56.239 and it this is not going to be something
01:51:59.199 that where where
01:52:00.080 it just suddenly pounces on you like ah
01:52:01.760 everyone getting chipped no
01:52:03.520 it's it's it's a very slow process of
01:52:06.080 okay let's first try to help people who
01:52:07.679 have serious brain injuries
01:52:09.440 like like if somebody got like a you
01:52:12.000 know broken
01:52:12.880 spinal cord injury or something like
01:52:14.320 that like that's one of the first things
01:52:15.440 we're looking at
01:52:16.159 at doing is like somebody maybe a
01:52:18.400 quadriplegic tetraplegic
01:52:20.320 how how do we give them uh like an
01:52:22.800 implant that allows them to use their
01:52:24.960 computer or their phone
01:52:28.400 and uh and have it be wireless and
01:52:31.520 uh you know like they look totally
01:52:32.960 normal you wouldn't even know that they
01:52:34.400 had a chip in their head
01:52:35.599 um and uh they could just charge it
01:52:37.840 inductively like you charge like a
01:52:39.520 fitbit or something like that or
01:52:41.280 apple watch something um and uh
01:52:44.560 that that's kind of like one of the
01:52:45.679 first applications we're thinking of is
01:52:47.119 like let's let's uh restore
01:52:49.440 uh functionality someone has had a
01:52:51.760 serious spinal injury
01:52:53.040 or a serious brain injury or some other
01:52:54.560 kind you know so this is going to be
01:52:56.000 like a very gradual process you'll see
01:52:57.679 it coming
01:52:58.480 you know but i was playing cyberpunk the
01:53:00.960 game and i'm like
01:53:01.630 [Laughter]
01:53:04.000 are you worried about where you're going
01:53:05.199 yeah that's like
01:53:07.280 yeah this is pretty close to home here
01:53:08.719 you know
01:53:12.000 like oh man um yeah
01:53:15.679 like is this where it leads my it might
01:53:18.480 lead there eventually i'm just saying
01:53:20.480 right now it's gonna help people who
01:53:22.719 really need it well you know we had this
01:53:24.239 discussion before that we're all
01:53:25.520 basically
01:53:26.000 already cyborgs right we're already
01:53:27.840 relying upon our phones
01:53:29.679 either connected it's a hip to them
01:53:31.679 people are relying on glasses and all
01:53:33.760 sorts of other technology to improve
01:53:35.199 their life
01:53:36.239 this is another gradual step in that
01:53:38.480 direction
01:53:39.520 and if you just keep going in that way
01:53:42.159 yeah it seems and
01:53:43.679 like i like being a human and i think
01:53:45.599 you know look here we're drinking
01:53:46.800 whiskey we're talking
01:53:48.080 yeah wood table this is very human
01:53:50.320 experience yeah
01:53:51.440 but ultimately we are archaic and we
01:53:54.719 will eventually be aliens we're going to
01:53:56.880 be
01:53:57.199 those those dudes with the big heads and
01:54:00.080 the
01:54:00.480 little tiny bodies and we're going to be
01:54:02.800 but we still
01:54:03.520 yeah we still need to feel for now
01:54:06.880 until i don't know i mean i think more
01:54:08.400 efficiently
01:54:10.400 yeah but then once it becomes virtual
01:54:12.880 once once virtual
01:54:15.119 supersedes whatever like imagine if
01:54:18.159 uh the virtual orgasm was a hundred
01:54:21.440 times better
01:54:22.560 than a regular orchestra i got news for
01:54:24.159 you on that front oh
01:54:25.920 we can it is
01:54:31.040 it's disturbingly good when you're
01:54:32.480 rubbing your chin
01:54:40.080 oh you'll love it money back guarantee
01:54:44.480 um do we love it it's a snap there was a
01:54:47.840 woman
01:54:48.560 who it was in the 1970s who had some
01:54:50.960 sort of analogy to pain pills
01:54:53.199 and uh they uh did some experiment with
01:54:56.239 her with a
01:54:56.960 uh they put wires
01:55:00.000 into her brain and gave her a device do
01:55:02.960 you know the story
01:55:05.119 there are a few stories like this yeah
01:55:06.320 yeah and where it actually hits the
01:55:08.320 pleasure center yeah and then you're
01:55:09.599 like my god this is the best thing ever
01:55:11.440 kept
01:55:12.000 hammering it she developed blisters on
01:55:14.880 her finger
01:55:15.840 that she used to hit the button she
01:55:17.280 never stopped hitting that button with
01:55:18.639 the same finger
01:55:19.520 didn't give a [ __ ] about those blisters
01:55:21.040 she was just coming constantly
01:55:22.960 yeah and then she started adjusting that
01:55:25.119 she tried to tamper with the device
01:55:27.040 to increase the amplitude she became
01:55:29.599 just
01:55:30.080 an orgasm junkie she's and she was crazy
01:55:32.800 and they tried to take
01:55:33.840 she was begging them to take it away
01:55:36.159 from her and then when they tried to
01:55:37.599 take it away from her she would fight
01:55:38.880 them
01:55:39.760 it was it's it's madness and it made me
01:55:42.719 i mean
01:55:43.119 i researched this extensively because i
01:55:45.599 was
01:55:46.239 fascinated by the idea that this could
01:55:48.000 eventually become a part we could
01:55:49.280 definitely
01:55:49.679 make that happen that's the that's a
01:55:51.520 real issue with people the
01:55:53.360 instrumentation
01:55:54.000 we wouldn't deserve because you know you
01:55:56.480 wouldn't do it but the chinese
01:55:58.480 uh sure i mean i i don't know my way
01:56:01.119 phones
01:56:01.679 immediately with a come button
01:56:03.440 [Music]
01:56:05.119 right as soon as you log on you give
01:56:06.480 them your fingerprint you come
01:56:08.800 you know i mean we could just put in
01:56:10.960 there with some software limits you know
01:56:12.480 easily but software limits could easily
01:56:14.480 be worked around
01:56:15.760 someone's going to come up with someone
01:56:17.199 on the dark web well i mean your
01:56:19.599 your phone is you're if you're carrying
01:56:21.440 a phone around you're carrying a
01:56:22.400 microphone
01:56:23.520 gps yeah camera yeah every day
01:56:26.320 everywhere
01:56:26.880 everything i mean orwell would be losing
01:56:28.560 his mind and it answers questions
01:56:30.560 yeah yeah and he knows where you are
01:56:32.320 yeah it's like you can just maybe have
01:56:33.520 it like it's it's
01:56:35.199 that phone by the way if you say like uh
01:56:37.280 please like turn off
01:56:38.639 it's it just says that it's off it's not
01:56:40.560 actually all it's lying
01:56:41.760 it could totally lie yeah and you can't
01:56:43.760 take the back
01:56:44.880 basically like apple or android anytime
01:56:46.639 they want they could just turn your mic
01:56:47.920 on
01:56:48.320 yeah or your camera your gps everything
01:56:51.760 yeah and just tell you it's off well i
01:56:54.159 looked at the setting it says it's off
01:56:55.760 yeah and some people like that's not
01:56:57.040 good enough i want it strapped to my
01:56:58.159 wrist
01:57:00.719 i need one on me all the time
01:57:03.840 yeah i mean these days like the modern
01:57:05.280 smartphone is it's like a tiny cell
01:57:06.960 phone on your
01:57:07.679 wrist it is yeah even has low cellular
01:57:09.920 connectivity and everything
01:57:10.800 everything it is everything you leave
01:57:12.880 your house you can make phone calls like
01:57:14.080 dick tracy
01:57:14.800 yeah yeah rather than anything tracy
01:57:17.760 even imagined
01:57:18.400 yeah [ __ ] it crazy yeah nothing he
01:57:21.040 didn't know [ __ ] stop track communicator
01:57:23.119 it's like it looks like a cheesy flower
01:57:24.400 so walkie-talkie you have to say over
01:57:26.639 kirk over a big one yeah they had to
01:57:29.360 tell you out you couldn't just hang up
01:57:32.400 yeah it was really ridiculous and they
01:57:34.000 couldn't get on the internet
01:57:35.440 couldn't take pictures yeah he was
01:57:37.440 talking to people from another planet
01:57:39.199 they couldn't even send them a photo i
01:57:41.840 mean they'd
01:57:42.400 even have a camera they would beam a
01:57:44.000 whole body just to see what's going on
01:57:46.560 rearrange your body right yeah take all
01:57:49.920 of your
01:57:50.560 all your atoms and reproject them on
01:57:53.840 this planet totally or
01:57:55.119 exactly well they could just stand a
01:57:56.159 camera
01:57:58.159 if you thought about that sending a
01:57:59.679 camera to this very dangerous situation
01:58:02.080 that really shows you how truly amazing
01:58:05.440 the internet
01:58:06.080 is that in all of science fiction they
01:58:08.880 never thought that was going to happen
01:58:10.880 yeah you think about all the star trek
01:58:13.199 star wars
01:58:14.320 they thought it would be out there on
01:58:15.440 where they thought we'd be on mars for
01:58:16.880 sure but that
01:58:17.760 but they never thought we'd have like a
01:58:19.599 super computer in our pocket that and
01:58:21.280 everyone's got a
01:58:22.320 you know an amazing camera and yeah as
01:58:24.800 much memories they could possibly
01:58:26.800 a super computer in your pocket like
01:58:28.159 something better than the best super
01:58:30.000 like your phone is better than the best
01:58:32.639 computer that earth had
01:58:34.000 by far in 1969 when we landed on oh yeah
01:58:37.599 by far
01:58:38.080 by far not even close the cameras like i
01:58:40.800 have a
01:58:41.679 samsung galaxy s21 that has a
01:58:45.199 moon photo capability so it's it's
01:58:48.400 designed it has a moon shot
01:58:50.480 so it's designed to be able to take
01:58:52.320 beautiful photos of the moon
01:58:55.040 and you can okay yeah it's like because
01:58:57.199 if you do with an iphone it's
01:58:58.800 it's not really programmed that way yeah
01:59:01.679 actually that's true the iphone cam
01:59:02.960 can't take good photos of the moon
01:59:04.159 because actually i was just like in l.a
01:59:05.920 and the
01:59:06.320 the moon was low in the horizon and it
01:59:08.080 was just like hanging there it's like
01:59:09.599 this
01:59:10.080 giant planetoid you need a galaxy yeah
01:59:12.800 and i'll try looking at my phone like it
01:59:14.159 looks like tiny
01:59:15.119 jimmy you got one of those talk to him
01:59:17.040 about the moonshot
01:59:18.880 didn't even know it was on there yeah
01:59:20.320 just google moonshot
01:59:22.159 with galaxy s21 ultra it's [ __ ]
01:59:24.800 phenomenal
01:59:25.920 i got i got one just for that i got one
01:59:28.639 because i'm always interested in the
01:59:30.320 both platforms and see where you're at
01:59:32.480 you know but the uh
01:59:33.679 the the photographs are [ __ ]
01:59:35.280 incredible the zoom's incredible too
01:59:37.520 they have much better zooms like look at
01:59:39.840 this these are photos with the
01:59:41.520 galaxy and that thing is just going to
01:59:43.599 be all camera out there isn't that
01:59:44.880 incredible i know look at the background
01:59:46.480 just to make it all out of lenses it's
01:59:49.119 it's incredible
01:59:50.480 it's just what they it's just we're
01:59:52.400 living in
01:59:53.520 it's constantly accelerating that's
01:59:55.760 what's so amazing about it
01:59:57.280 is that the right one to mars photo with
01:59:58.960 that i don't i don't know that's why
02:00:01.040 you're taking a photo of marshall phone
02:00:02.639 like yeah no
02:00:04.239 no impossible thank you glad you're here
02:00:07.040 for that
02:00:07.520 because we would buy right into it i
02:00:10.480 think that was last year's uh model
02:00:12.960 what last year's model could take a
02:00:14.719 picture of the no no no like lots
02:00:16.639 last year's moon photo versus this
02:00:18.159 year's oh yeah i mean if you had a giant
02:00:20.480 like uh
02:00:21.280 lens or something after basically you
02:00:23.280 need a photon
02:00:24.719 distillery so that's some that's the
02:00:26.480 moon that's all that is on the right
02:00:27.760 it's not mars it's just a shitty
02:00:29.440 it's like their last year's version of
02:00:32.159 moonshot
02:00:32.800 so the new one can actually see the
02:00:34.560 craters which is just
02:00:36.400 [ __ ] bananas i mean if that's just on
02:00:38.639 a camera without a
02:00:40.080 lens because you're just like saying
02:00:41.119 what's your photon gathering area you
02:00:42.800 know it's like photons per
02:00:44.480 unit area certain limit if you were
02:00:47.119 what's that jamie's honestly not that
02:00:48.320 good
02:00:48.960 well it's pretty good for a cell phone
02:00:50.880 yeah yeah sure i mean it's not great for
02:00:52.400 a telescope
02:00:53.280 sure well i mean the thing i was trying
02:00:55.119 to do like literally
02:00:57.199 uh you know i don't know five or six
02:00:59.920 days ago
02:01:00.880 there was just like the i don't know you
02:01:03.520 know the air was clear
02:01:04.639 like l.a can be amazing like on a clear
02:01:07.040 winter day
02:01:08.320 where the moon is low in the horizon
02:01:10.560 yeah and the the
02:01:11.840 sun's hitting at the right angle and
02:01:13.920 just looks incredible
02:01:15.119 um and i was trying to take a photo of
02:01:17.199 that with my phone and it looked
02:01:18.080 terrible
02:01:18.800 yeah it just never yeah i can't capture
02:01:21.199 it no
02:01:21.920 no unfortunately but galaxies can this
02:01:25.119 is that's the interesting thing it's
02:01:26.239 like
02:01:26.719 the galaxy yeah well it's a great name
02:01:29.280 too
02:01:29.840 they they just they're always one step
02:01:32.960 ahead
02:01:33.760 in many directions like they have these
02:01:35.760 ultrasonic fingerprint detectors
02:01:37.679 but they just can't beat the operating
02:01:39.199 system apple just has the ease of use
02:01:42.320 and there is
02:01:43.040 is it still good it's still better apple
02:01:45.280 yeah it's still better
02:01:46.159 yeah it's but it's close it's close but
02:01:48.960 the other thing that bothers me about
02:01:50.320 google is google is constantly tracking
02:01:52.080 you
02:01:52.560 android phones there's like so let me
02:01:54.719 see if you're an ad
02:01:55.679 it's so hard to avoid but they'll know
02:01:58.719 you better than you know yourself
02:02:00.320 they know what you will want i'm a big
02:02:02.159 admirer of what tim cook is doing
02:02:04.320 what what he's doing to sort of cut them
02:02:06.560 out from their ability to
02:02:08.400 constantly track you and and gather your
02:02:11.040 data
02:02:11.920 and this battle that's going on between
02:02:13.760 tim cook and facebook i [ __ ] love it
02:02:15.599 i love that he's stepping up
02:02:17.360 yeah and saying hey you can just
02:02:19.360 advertise you don't have to
02:02:21.199 gather up people's data and sell it
02:02:23.119 constantly and then
02:02:24.599 disingenuously facebook tries to say you
02:02:26.560 are killing small businesses
02:02:28.400 with these here
02:02:31.520 the decisions out of here you're not
02:02:32.880 killing small business we're killing
02:02:34.320 this
02:02:34.719 one gigantic information gathering
02:02:37.840 business that's decided
02:02:39.360 that it's gonna take all of the data
02:02:42.400 that people didn't know was valuable and
02:02:44.639 sell it and make [ __ ] billions of
02:02:46.480 dollars
02:02:47.360 yeah well i mean even perhaps arguably
02:02:50.159 worse they're going to feed all that
02:02:51.360 data into their um
02:02:52.639 the ai that they're developing it's
02:02:54.800 called facebook ai you can follow them
02:02:56.239 on twitter
02:02:57.760 and they're like just let's just feed
02:02:59.440 all those informations into the ai and
02:03:01.440 see what to see what it is
02:03:03.280 yeah who knows what would happen you
02:03:05.040 know it seems like
02:03:06.880 i don't know some dystopian outcomes are
02:03:09.440 possible
02:03:10.320 yeah well you're terrified of ai right
02:03:13.199 no well i mean i just think
02:03:14.960 if it's unchecked no well i think
02:03:18.480 things that are a danger to the public
02:03:21.599 should have some kind of public
02:03:22.719 oversight
02:03:23.440 yeah so you know like i
02:03:27.119 you know although sometimes we have our
02:03:28.800 disagreements i'm
02:03:30.159 you know in favor of the faa and uh
02:03:33.360 nitsa you know the the various
02:03:35.679 regulatory agencies
02:03:37.679 fda and so forth you know i think it's
02:03:40.239 we're better off having them than not
02:03:41.440 having them
02:03:42.320 um um there is a risk
02:03:45.679 a risk-reward asymmetry in that they're
02:03:47.760 that they tend to be
02:03:48.960 perhaps not not weigh the good as much
02:03:51.840 as they weigh the bad
02:03:53.199 um you know yeah because their their
02:03:56.159 incentive structure is
02:03:57.360 uh you know they get punished a lot for
02:04:00.000 approving something but they don't get
02:04:01.280 punished that much for not approving
02:04:02.880 stuffing
02:04:03.840 so that's just in the nature of
02:04:05.920 government
02:04:07.440 um but nonetheless i think everyone
02:04:09.360 would would
02:04:10.719 you know feel safer flying with the faa
02:04:12.960 than not having an faa
02:04:15.599 or we feel safer buying food and drugs
02:04:19.599 having a regulatory agency oversee this
02:04:21.760 stuff
02:04:23.440 but we don't have any regulatory agency
02:04:25.119 overseeing artificial intelligence
02:04:27.119 right and this i think is our probably
02:04:30.480 our biggest
02:04:31.360 existential threat
02:04:34.719 yeah it's it seems like hey we should
02:04:37.520 like have somebody keep an eye on there
02:04:38.880 you know
02:04:39.920 right but who that's the problem i don't
02:04:42.239 know the problem is the
02:04:43.440 government who's going to do joe biden
02:04:45.360 let's have him pay attention to it
02:04:46.880 no i mean this is like the deep state oh
02:04:50.159 those folks
02:04:51.599 well they're looking out for our best
02:04:53.040 interests they're surely going to watch
02:04:54.719 out
02:04:55.119 what they're going to do is they're
02:04:56.159 going to develop it and use it as a
02:04:57.599 weapon it's going to turn on like a
02:04:58.960 [ __ ] terminator movie
02:05:01.920 right that's the real worry is that
02:05:03.840 they're going to decide
02:05:05.040 that this is a very valuable tool
02:05:08.320 for controlling populations
02:05:12.000 governments whatever the [ __ ] they're
02:05:14.639 going to use it for
02:05:15.760 and then it's going to decide why am i
02:05:17.840 listening to you yeah
02:05:21.199 if you read like the plot line for
02:05:23.040 terminator it's actually
02:05:25.760 it's actually pretty smart like james
02:05:27.360 cameron wrote a pretty
02:05:28.800 smart script there it's not it's not
02:05:32.480 quite as like or there's just like
02:05:34.159 arnold schwarzenegger chasing you down
02:05:35.440 the street
02:05:36.000 it's like well how did cyber dying
02:05:37.280 systems develop it's like well they were
02:05:39.360 a multi-military contractor and
02:05:41.920 they were asked to develop um a
02:05:45.119 a a protective system something that
02:05:47.119 would protect it
02:05:48.400 for cyber security you know so we need
02:05:51.360 to have
02:05:52.159 protection against cyber attacks
02:05:55.280 so its primary thing is to defend
02:05:57.920 against cyber attacks
02:06:00.400 to develop an ai that can defend against
02:06:02.239 cyber attacks sounds pretty reasonable
02:06:04.719 um and then as part of the what the ai
02:06:08.000 did
02:06:08.400 is it it in order to defend itself it it
02:06:11.280 propagated throughout the world
02:06:12.719 to keep to keep an eye on things see
02:06:14.480 what was going on
02:06:16.320 and then they they the then they've
02:06:19.040 thought well
02:06:19.679 hang on this is there's something they
02:06:21.440 didn't realize that it was cyber
02:06:22.880 that it was skynet that was propagating
02:06:24.880 through all these systems
02:06:26.560 and i said okay uh the there seems to be
02:06:29.599 something propagating through all these
02:06:30.719 systems
02:06:31.199 skynet you need to stop it you need to
02:06:33.920 end it
02:06:34.639 and skynet said oh you've asked me to
02:06:37.440 destroy myself
02:06:39.119 uh you are the enemy you must be
02:06:41.280 destroyed
02:06:42.800 that's how uh terminator actually goes
02:06:46.400 like it was created as a defense system
02:06:49.440 to defend against cyber attacks then it
02:06:52.239 was asked to destroy itself
02:06:54.079 and then a concluded humanity was the
02:06:55.599 enemy
02:06:57.119 hmm that's too close to home right
02:07:01.599 well you know earlier we talked about
02:07:04.239 what is the meaning of life
02:07:06.400 well the the the meaning of life for us
02:07:09.840 would be very different in the meaning
02:07:11.199 of life or something that we create that
02:07:12.719 becomes life
02:07:14.800 the idea of life being restricted to
02:07:16.719 cells or carbon-based life forms
02:07:18.639 is kind of silly like the idea of
02:07:21.040 artificial life right what is artificial
02:07:23.199 it's right there what are you talking
02:07:24.480 about
02:07:25.119 ai artificial insemination
02:07:28.400 i think it's but it is expensive you ask
02:07:30.960 if we create
02:07:32.320 if we create some sort of silicon based
02:07:34.880 life form
02:07:36.000 but it acts like a life form it has
02:07:40.320 a desire
02:07:43.840 [Laughter]
02:07:46.400 it was i think in australia a few years
02:07:49.040 ago
02:07:50.000 um an artificial insemination lab that
02:07:53.119 had
02:07:53.599 had a bunch of like bulges stored in
02:07:56.400 bile
02:07:56.880 in in canisters but it like overheated
02:08:00.320 and so that you had basically exploding
02:08:03.280 bulges all over the place
02:08:04.960 really and that line was ai goes wild
02:08:08.560 has come everywhere
02:08:11.390 [Laughter]
02:08:18.480 yeah just like come rockets all over the
02:08:20.560 place yeah
02:08:22.160 [Applause]
02:08:23.440 nobody wants that right yeah does that
02:08:25.679 help them clean up on
02:08:26.960 uh you know all nine or whatever
02:08:29.390 [Laughter]
02:08:33.760 bullet joe's all over the walls
02:08:35.920 literally
02:08:36.880 it actually happened yeah
02:08:42.560 back to artificial insight wait i mean
02:08:44.800 artificial intelligence
02:08:46.880 back to artificial intelligence i'm
02:08:49.599 really worried
02:08:50.079 about it yeah i think we should be
02:08:52.239 concerned and we should have uh
02:08:53.360 oversight of some kind
02:08:54.639 yeah but who would be the oversight like
02:08:56.320 i don't know like the regulatory agency
02:08:57.840 i don't know whoever
02:08:58.880 yeah it's like you know people have the
02:09:00.159 faa like i said we have the faa we got
02:09:02.079 the
02:09:04.480 um fda
02:09:08.079 yeah but uh we just need an acronym to
02:09:10.719 oversee this stuff
02:09:11.599 the problem is like governing government
02:09:13.679 agencies suck at most things
02:09:16.239 you know yeah what i mean it's the best
02:09:18.880 government agency
02:09:20.320 like what what what government agency
02:09:22.159 does the best job
02:09:23.679 of oversight no i i think generally
02:09:27.119 um okay i mean i think the right way to
02:09:30.480 think about government is government is
02:09:32.000 a corporation in the limit
02:09:33.840 like there's some people like well like
02:09:35.119 we're against corporations but we're for
02:09:36.880 government i'm like
02:09:37.679 governor's just the biggest corporation
02:09:38.960 what are you talking about you know it's
02:09:40.480 a corporation with a monopoly
02:09:42.079 it's the biggest corporation and has
02:09:44.079 monopoly
02:09:45.679 that's government so but you get to pick
02:09:48.960 who runs it
02:09:51.119 yeah you have more influence on who is
02:09:53.520 ceo of
02:09:54.239 general electric than you have on who's
02:09:55.679 president really
02:09:57.360 sure how so well i mean you're gonna
02:09:59.599 have how many voters are there like 150
02:10:02.400 million i don't know
02:10:03.520 and maybe a hundred million who actually
02:10:05.280 vote so you have 100 millionth
02:10:08.400 of a vote and if you're not in a swing
02:10:11.520 state
02:10:12.560 it doesn't matter um so
02:10:15.920 i'm here live in california it's going
02:10:17.119 democratic this is for sure
02:10:19.679 gavin newsom might be [ __ ] that up
02:10:23.040 um i do think you know in california in
02:10:26.800 any given state there's got to be uh
02:10:28.960 above zero percent chance that the other
02:10:30.880 party wins
02:10:32.079 right if it's zero percent chance that
02:10:33.679 the other party wins they get cocky the
02:10:36.000 forcing yeah
02:10:36.719 the forcing function for being reset
02:10:38.800 like are they going to be responsive to
02:10:40.239 the people
02:10:40.880 right they're only going to be
02:10:42.000 responsible to the people if the other
02:10:43.199 party has a shot at winning right
02:10:44.480 they're going to be responsive to the
02:10:45.599 special interest groups that help them
02:10:46.960 yeah exactly and that's where california
02:10:48.880 yeah yeah so
02:10:52.560 anyway so government is corporation in
02:10:54.400 the limit it's a
02:10:55.679 it's the government is the biggest
02:10:56.800 corporation with a monopoly nonetheless
02:11:00.159 uh it there are some things that it's
02:11:03.440 hard to see
02:11:04.239 having be an industry buddy
02:11:07.280 the probability of regulatory capture if
02:11:09.840 it's an industry body is higher than if
02:11:11.520 it's the government
02:11:12.400 this it's not zero if it's the
02:11:13.840 government there's plenty of cases
02:11:14.960 regulatory capture
02:11:16.320 uh for for federal agencies but
02:11:20.079 um but the probability is lower than if
02:11:22.639 it's an industry group
02:11:24.079 and at the end of the day somebody asked
02:11:26.719 to say
02:11:27.440 you know go and tell facebook or
02:11:30.480 google or apple or tesla tesla has a lot
02:11:33.119 of advanced ai
02:11:35.040 this is okay or it's not okay uh or at
02:11:37.840 least
02:11:38.320 and be able to report back to the public
02:11:40.000 this is what we found
02:11:42.880 uh otherwise the inmates are running the
02:11:44.800 asylum yeah
02:11:46.239 and there's like not necessarily
02:11:47.840 friendly inmates no
02:11:50.239 i just wonder like if you wanted to
02:11:53.920 compile some sort of a regulatory body
02:11:56.480 to
02:11:56.790 [Music]
02:11:58.400 keep an eye on ai how would you do that
02:12:01.520 and how would you avoid having them
02:12:04.000 being incentivized by special interest
02:12:06.560 groups or
02:12:07.679 some sort of corporation that would
02:12:09.040 profit on ai succeeding
02:12:11.520 oh that's already happening yeah
02:12:14.639 um i mean all the companies are going
02:12:17.440 hog wild on the air front so
02:12:21.520 anyway i i my recommendation that should
02:12:24.880 be some kind of regulatory
02:12:26.400 authority so how would they do that and
02:12:28.320 i'm not you know i'm not
02:12:29.679 i'm i'm not a fan of like let's have the
02:12:31.360 government do lots of things i think you
02:12:32.800 want to have the government do the least
02:12:34.079 amount of stuff but and i think the the
02:12:37.360 you know right role of government is to
02:12:38.480 be like the referee on the field you
02:12:40.159 know
02:12:40.800 when the governor starts being the
02:12:41.920 player on the field that's problematic
02:12:43.520 or
02:12:44.000 when you start having more referees than
02:12:45.599 players which is the case in california
02:12:47.679 then that's not good
02:12:50.800 yeah um so you can't have no referees
02:12:55.280 yeah everyone agrees the referee may be
02:12:58.159 it might be annoying at times
02:12:59.599 but it's better that referee than not
02:13:01.360 yes yeah
02:13:04.719 i'm i'm just worried that these things
02:13:06.480 are gonna it's gonna be too late
02:13:07.920 by the time and i'm sure you're worried
02:13:09.199 about it as well but by the time these
02:13:11.440 things become sentient
02:13:12.800 by the time they develop the ability to
02:13:16.480 analyze
02:13:17.199 what the threat of human beings are and
02:13:19.119 whether or not human beings are
02:13:20.239 essential
02:13:22.400 yeah i'm not saying that having
02:13:24.639 regulatory agencies on panacea
02:13:26.560 or reduces the risk to zero there's
02:13:29.520 still significant risk
02:13:30.719 even with the regulatory agency
02:13:33.840 nonetheless i think the good outweighs
02:13:36.239 the bad of and we should have one
02:13:38.239 um the the the
02:13:41.520 you know it took a while before there
02:13:42.800 was an faa you know there were a lot of
02:13:44.639 plane crashes
02:13:45.760 a lot of companies cutting corners um
02:13:48.960 it took a while before there's an fda
02:13:50.639 you know this and and
02:13:52.400 is what tends to happen is you know some
02:13:55.040 company gets desperate they're on the
02:13:56.239 verge of bankruptcy and they're like ah
02:13:58.239 man
02:13:58.800 uh we'll just cut this corner it'll be
02:14:00.639 fine um
02:14:02.800 and then you know
02:14:06.079 somebody dies you know and
02:14:09.199 you know some of these like regulatory
02:14:10.800 situations like look at seat belts
02:14:12.880 i mean now we take seat belts for
02:14:14.079 granted man the car company sports seat
02:14:15.599 belts like there was no tomorrow
02:14:17.199 uh they tried everything oh yeah they
02:14:18.960 fought them for
02:14:20.560 decades like 15 20 years
02:14:24.159 the data was absolutely
02:14:27.599 clear that you needed seat belts like
02:14:30.000 seat belts
02:14:31.920 you know you really needed seat belts
02:14:36.239 like the difference in fatalities and
02:14:37.760 serious injuries seat belt not seated
02:14:39.199 well it's gigantic
02:14:40.320 and obvious it's not subtle so
02:14:44.560 but still the car companies fought
02:14:46.239 seatbelts for
02:14:47.599 i don't know 10 20 years
02:14:53.040 a lot of people died
02:14:56.960 now these ain't actually with advanced
02:14:59.599 airbags
02:15:00.480 actually i'm not i think we might have
02:15:01.599 come full circle and no longer need seat
02:15:03.520 belts if you have advanced airbags
02:15:04.880 really
02:15:05.360 yeah um i think there's a strong
02:15:07.760 argument for saying if you've got
02:15:09.119 what if the car flips no you're just
02:15:11.440 you're just covered in plenty
02:15:12.880 it's airbags everywhere
02:15:16.400 bottom airbags are so good you you
02:15:19.520 blow your mind just how good the airbags
02:15:21.599 are
02:15:22.719 and tesla we up we even update the
02:15:24.800 software to improve how the airbags
02:15:26.400 deploy
02:15:27.119 so we'll calculate you know are you an
02:15:30.400 adult
02:15:31.199 like how much do you weigh are you
02:15:32.800 sitting in this part of the seat or that
02:15:34.639 part of the seat are you maybe
02:15:36.000 a baby are you a toddler are you based
02:15:38.480 on the weight
02:15:39.520 yeah so the seat not just the weight but
02:15:41.440 the pressure distribute distribution on
02:15:43.040 the seat
02:15:43.840 so we're measuring the pressure
02:15:45.040 distribution are you sitting on the edge
02:15:46.880 of your seat
02:15:47.840 are you a fifth percentile female and 95
02:15:50.320 percentile male
02:15:51.360 the airbag firing will be different
02:15:52.719 depending upon where you're sitting on
02:15:54.159 the seat and what size you are and what
02:15:55.520 your orientation is
02:15:57.040 really yeah and we'll update it
02:16:00.079 uh over the air so it even gets better
02:16:02.800 over time
02:16:03.440 so a child could conceivably sit in the
02:16:05.360 front seat unbelted
02:16:06.880 child sitting in a in a bad position
02:16:10.719 probably still fine jesus christ yeah
02:16:14.960 it's dynamically updating this the
02:16:16.639 airbag firing according
02:16:18.000 to your where you're sitting how much
02:16:21.040 you weigh
02:16:23.280 in real time the seat belt is like
02:16:27.599 if you wear the seat belt that's nice
02:16:31.440 but the airbag is going to do most of
02:16:32.879 the work airbag's doing the work and
02:16:35.359 is it possible that we can come up with
02:16:36.718 something even better than the airbag
02:16:39.920 like you fill the whole cabin up with
02:16:41.599 foam
02:16:43.840 now yeah it's tough because
02:16:46.879 airbag technology is crazy good um
02:16:49.439 because you want the airbag to inflate
02:16:51.200 and then deflate right so otherwise
02:16:53.280 you're going to get asphyxiated
02:16:54.478 you know okay so you can just like fill
02:16:56.318 it up with stuff it's got to
02:16:57.679 inflate and then and there's different
02:17:00.160 stages of inflation
02:17:01.439 it's like uh fast inflation and slow
02:17:04.240 inflation
02:17:04.799 then slowly subside i the sophistication
02:17:08.398 of airbags is crazy good
02:17:09.840 and this is all done not through some
02:17:12.000 regulatory body this is done
02:17:13.519 through your own desire to make these
02:17:16.000 things safer
02:17:17.040 and more efficient i mean in the case of
02:17:19.280 tesla we go way beyond
02:17:21.359 the regulatory requirements
02:17:24.558 you know so like we got the lowest
02:17:26.240 probability of injury of any cars
02:17:27.519 they've ever tested
02:17:28.879 um so it was five stars in every
02:17:31.920 category and subcategory
02:17:33.599 and if there was a six star we get a six
02:17:35.280 star um
02:17:37.040 it's total it is actually legal to have
02:17:38.638 one star car
02:17:40.398 really yeah what's like a smart car are
02:17:43.040 those one star
02:17:45.200 oh oh i got to tell you this okay so the
02:17:47.840 star rating is kind of [ __ ]
02:17:49.439 really yeah i'm probably necessarily
02:17:50.879 gonna be upset about me about this but
02:17:53.920 um they adjust the star rating depending
02:17:56.240 upon the size of the car
02:17:58.478 so i mean it stands to reason that if
02:18:00.398 you're in a freight train
02:18:01.599 and you're you know and if a smart car
02:18:03.920 hits a freight train it doesn't matter
02:18:05.439 how good your
02:18:06.478 safety systems is you're screwed um
02:18:10.638 you know if you're in a little car get
02:18:12.638 hit by a big car
02:18:14.080 the big car will win okay so
02:18:17.200 a low star rating in a big car hitting
02:18:20.478 a high star rating in a small car the
02:18:22.638 small car is screwed
02:18:24.080 small cars are not safe
02:18:27.519 yeah they're not safe right yeah
02:18:30.879 but what about your small car our model
02:18:33.519 3 is not small
02:18:35.040 what is medium the roadster yeah the
02:18:37.599 roadster is not super safe
02:18:39.359 original roadster not super safe the
02:18:42.000 original roadster safe for a car
02:18:43.840 like that but it's not it's it's safety
02:18:46.959 maximization is not the golden sports
02:18:48.799 car
02:18:49.120 well the original one was based on a
02:18:50.478 lotus right
02:18:52.718 yeah that was the theory but in reality
02:18:58.160 it was low to c i think we had like
02:19:01.599 maybe seven percent i think we
02:19:03.200 calculated seven percent of the parts
02:19:04.799 were actually carry over from the lotus
02:19:06.718 the entire body
02:19:08.160 chassis everything was redesigned new
02:19:10.160 powertrain
02:19:11.280 even the hvac system used to run off a
02:19:13.280 belt from the engine
02:19:14.638 now we need an electric hvac system so
02:19:18.558 pretty almost everything got changed um
02:19:21.519 it was
02:19:22.000 uh not a it's something that sounded
02:19:24.638 good
02:19:25.439 let's take an ac propulsion drivetrain
02:19:28.318 from this little
02:19:29.120 little company in la let's stick it in a
02:19:31.200 modified lotus elise
02:19:32.558 bingo we got a car only problem is
02:19:36.160 a lot of problems both of the
02:19:38.718 fundamental premises
02:19:39.840 on which tesla was created are false
02:19:43.040 the the battery ended up increasing the
02:19:46.080 the mass of the car by 30 percent so
02:19:48.800 then
02:19:49.200 and the weight distribution was all
02:19:50.560 different so you invalidated all the
02:19:51.840 crash tests
02:19:52.960 now you have to stretch the car in order
02:19:54.800 to fit the battery so now the chassis is
02:19:56.560 different
02:19:58.560 uh all the airbags have to be redone all
02:20:00.880 the crash structure had to be redone
02:20:03.040 um it would have been better to start
02:20:06.640 from scratch
02:20:07.520 than to use than to start to then to use
02:20:10.560 any part of a lotus lease
02:20:13.040 it was worse it was like like let's say
02:20:14.960 there's a house that you want
02:20:16.720 you haven't mined a particular house and
02:20:19.040 then you buy
02:20:19.840 you buy a pr you buy a house and you end
02:20:21.920 up changing everything except one wall
02:20:24.080 and the basement
02:20:26.319 but you're still stuck with most of the
02:20:28.319 original footprint
02:20:30.720 it's just easier sometimes just knock
02:20:32.319 the house down build a new one
02:20:33.760 um don't just try to modify it one piece
02:20:35.840 at a time
02:20:37.600 so the like so we
02:20:41.280 had to change over 90 percent of the the
02:20:43.520 non-power train portion of the car
02:20:45.280 had to be changed 90 93
02:20:48.880 um and then the the the battery and
02:20:52.319 drivetrain from ac propulsion did not
02:20:54.080 work
02:20:55.120 uh the the it had a
02:21:00.880 you know an analog motor controller that
02:21:03.520 was extremely unreliable
02:21:06.160 um the the the way that the
02:21:09.920 power electronics were done it was
02:21:11.680 artisanal
02:21:13.120 you could not recreate that in a
02:21:15.439 production situation
02:21:17.439 uh the battery pack was air-cooled which
02:21:21.359 meant that if it was cold outside the
02:21:23.120 car didn't work
02:21:25.120 if it was uh hot too hot the battery
02:21:28.240 would overheat
02:21:30.080 and if you had any cell any part of this
02:21:32.640 any one of the cells in the
02:21:33.760 battery pack had a heat concentration
02:21:36.399 you could not remove it the air was just
02:21:38.160 not it's not good enough to just
02:21:39.520 air cool the pack and so you could have
02:21:41.840 thermal runway in the pack with the
02:21:43.200 carbon down
02:21:44.880 so we can use the battery pack couldn't
02:21:47.280 use the motor
02:21:49.359 you can use the inverter
02:21:53.439 you can use a charger in the end we used
02:21:55.920 none of the ac propulsion technology
02:21:58.319 and almost none of the lotus technology
02:22:00.720 wow
02:22:01.920 so you just have the general shape it
02:22:05.840 it has a passing resemblance to
02:22:09.359 a lotus elise but if you put the lotus
02:22:11.040 leaves in the roaster side by side they
02:22:13.200 look
02:22:13.520 actually quite different and i actually
02:22:17.439 led the design of the the rose so the
02:22:20.720 product design of the roadster they gave
02:22:22.479 me like a
02:22:24.000 fasting school art gave me like a
02:22:25.600 honorary doctorate for it
02:22:27.200 but be totally frank it's easy to do a
02:22:28.960 design of a sports car
02:22:30.479 it's very hard to do design of a sedan i
02:22:33.359 tried i failed
02:22:34.479 and that's why i hired um bronson
02:22:37.520 holzhausen who's
02:22:38.479 been our head of design since 2008. he's
02:22:41.359 great
02:22:42.399 he does things like i that are beyond my
02:22:44.319 skill you know we talked about this
02:22:46.080 before but
02:22:46.640 it's it's worth bringing up again um
02:22:49.040 i've always been a fan of top gear
02:22:50.800 but i got disgusted when i found out
02:22:53.840 what they did
02:22:55.040 with your car when they tried to pretend
02:22:56.960 that the car broke down
02:22:58.160 just to make an entertaining
02:23:01.280 program where they had a laugh at the
02:23:03.280 folly of this thing
02:23:04.960 dying on them but it didn't really die
02:23:07.040 on them yeah that was messed up i mean
02:23:08.960 to be totally friendly
02:23:09.840 so you know new top gear in top gear of
02:23:13.040 recent years
02:23:14.479 is a tesla supporter so one of like just
02:23:16.880 voice a note of appreciation for
02:23:18.960 top gear of recent years james may he
02:23:21.760 has one right
02:23:23.520 but they're not top gear anymore right
02:23:24.880 they're the grand tour
02:23:26.640 that's what they are on amazon is that
02:23:28.240 what they call them i i don't know but
02:23:30.560 top gear has been supportive in recent
02:23:32.000 years but um yeah back in the day
02:23:34.640 uh and remember at the time like tesla
02:23:36.479 was not a big company we're just a
02:23:37.600 little company
02:23:38.640 and we're like you know yeah we're
02:23:41.840 the little kid on the block so um
02:23:45.680 and we you know we're so we the top gear
02:23:47.520 is like hey top gear wants to test your
02:23:48.720 car like cool and we gave them
02:23:50.640 we only had a few cars and we gave them
02:23:52.160 one of our cars and when
02:23:53.760 we handed over the car they had a right
02:23:56.160 you know
02:23:56.960 so one of our engineers like ghost
02:23:58.720 delivers the car and then he sees a
02:24:00.399 script on the table
02:24:02.000 it's like how'd you write the script
02:24:05.040 you don't even yo we only just gave you
02:24:06.399 the car and in the script
02:24:09.120 the car breaks down yeah it's messed up
02:24:13.040 yeah it was crazy it was crazy it was
02:24:16.080 crazy because they basically sabotaged
02:24:17.760 the company i mean that had to cost you
02:24:19.200 guys a shitload of money
02:24:20.640 because a lot of people watch that show
02:24:21.920 and car enthusiasts like myself
02:24:24.319 kind of rely on them for this also like
02:24:27.520 obviously jeremy clarkson's hilarious
02:24:29.520 there's information
02:24:30.800 there it's funny but you would imagine
02:24:33.359 that they could do that without lying
02:24:35.520 about the actual performance of the car
02:24:39.280 yeah the car never broke down they just
02:24:42.240 they just pretended that it did and they
02:24:43.840 wrote the script
02:24:44.720 so crazy literally whenever a guy is
02:24:47.200 handed over the car
02:24:48.399 is reading through a script it's like
02:24:50.000 the cars break breaks down it like runs
02:24:51.760 out i
02:24:52.880 charge the brakes fail and we're like
02:24:54.720 what the [ __ ] man we just gave you the
02:24:56.080 car
02:24:56.720 this is not cool and what did they say
02:24:59.120 about that
02:25:01.920 uh their their objection was like this
02:25:05.120 is just entertainment it's not meant to
02:25:06.560 be true
02:25:07.200 that's so crazy though because that's
02:25:09.120 they they had to know what the [ __ ]
02:25:10.560 they're doing
02:25:11.439 yeah yeah but
02:25:14.960 anyway well now we're under the bridge
02:25:17.120 water under the bridge
02:25:18.160 but crazy for for anybody who
02:25:19.920 experienced it back in the day i mean i
02:25:21.439 remember
02:25:22.080 i knew very little about electric cars
02:25:24.640 it was just the early days and i
02:25:26.000 remember watching that going oh
02:25:27.359 that sucks broke down yeah
02:25:37.600 well you know anyway i've been a fan of
02:25:40.720 electric cars since for you know for a
02:25:42.080 long time since
02:25:42.880 uh basically high school early early
02:25:45.840 college
02:25:47.200 um what'd you think of that documentary
02:25:50.000 who killed the electric car
02:25:52.160 i thought it was pretty good yeah yeah
02:25:54.399 it's worth watching
02:25:55.359 interesting mortally wounded not killed
02:25:59.359 exactly exactly but i mean the irony is
02:26:02.000 like
02:26:02.800 man can you imagine just how different a
02:26:04.560 future gm would have had
02:26:06.080 because they had the ev1 electric
02:26:07.840 vehicle one
02:26:09.200 if they had just gone eb2 ev3 man they
02:26:12.479 would have just
02:26:13.920 owned the world who knows where we'd be
02:26:15.680 right now with electric cars too and the
02:26:17.120 technology with that kind of money
02:26:18.399 behind yeah
02:26:19.600 it's fascinating now you're seeing like
02:26:22.000 this mustang
02:26:23.520 this uh sort of suv style mustang that's
02:26:26.479 electric
02:26:27.200 yeah you know you're seeing so many
02:26:28.880 different vehicles that are electric
02:26:30.800 there's so many companies that have
02:26:32.160 electric cars now and it's really been
02:26:35.120 becoming interesting porsche's electric
02:26:36.960 car there's there's
02:26:38.640 a large supply of electric cars now
02:26:42.880 i mean that's got to make you feel good
02:26:44.160 though because without you
02:26:46.160 and without tesla this i mean there was
02:26:49.040 no way it would be where it's at right
02:26:50.560 now
02:26:52.319 uh yeah i mean when i think about like
02:26:53.680 what's the final good of tesla
02:26:56.160 it's to what degree have we accelerated
02:26:58.080 the advent of sustainable energy
02:27:00.800 you know so it would have happened
02:27:02.960 anyway but i think
02:27:04.240 tesla is an accelerant you know i think
02:27:06.800 we're
02:27:08.319 that's how we judge the fundamental good
02:27:09.840 of tesla by how many years did we
02:27:11.280 accelerate
02:27:12.000 the advent of sustainable energy um
02:27:18.640 but yeah i mean in the early days my
02:27:20.319 interest in electric cars was mostly
02:27:21.680 driven by the fact that
02:27:22.800 uh wisdom was not it wasn't
02:27:24.800 environmental in the sense of like co2
02:27:27.840 uh you know parts per million in the
02:27:29.520 atmosphere type of thing i do think the
02:27:31.120 artist added urgency to the situation
02:27:33.120 but
02:27:34.080 um my original interest was it was just
02:27:36.000 like we're going to run out oil
02:27:37.520 and then civilization is going to
02:27:38.880 collapse and so if we don't
02:27:41.439 have some kind of sustainable energy
02:27:43.280 situation which really is electric cars
02:27:45.760 the solar energy and electric cars
02:27:47.920 um then civilization's gonna fall apart
02:27:50.960 and and we'll be back in the stone age
02:27:54.080 or something like someone bad you know
02:27:55.920 um but we're not going to be able to
02:27:57.920 move forward
02:27:59.280 it won't be a good future so
02:28:02.560 so my interest in electric cars was like
02:28:04.240 okay how do we
02:28:05.920 how do we make this work um
02:28:09.439 and you think of like a gasoline car i
02:28:11.120 mean it's got an electric motor
02:28:13.040 and a battery just to start the car you
02:28:15.520 know like electric cars like way simpler
02:28:17.760 than a gasoline car
02:28:19.439 just need it's just a range question so
02:28:23.200 in the early days of cars there were um
02:28:26.560 you know almost as many electric cars as
02:28:28.319 there were gasoline cars in the very
02:28:29.520 early days
02:28:31.200 but the the batteries weren't didn't
02:28:33.040 have enough range
02:28:34.240 so um
02:28:37.359 you know as soon as they had an electric
02:28:38.720 starter and you didn't have to hand
02:28:40.000 crank the engine
02:28:41.040 then gasoline cars won
02:28:44.240 um because i had the range so it's
02:28:46.720 really a question of like how do you
02:28:47.760 solve the range palm
02:28:50.080 and um you know when i first came out
02:28:53.200 it came out to california the reason i
02:28:55.120 came out of california was to
02:28:57.760 work on energy storage solutions for
02:29:00.800 electric cars
02:29:01.600 basically advanced um
02:29:04.800 about ways to store electric electric
02:29:07.520 energy
02:29:09.120 that would give you long range so in my
02:29:12.240 summer internships i worked at
02:29:13.920 this company called pinnacle research
02:29:15.439 that that did
02:29:18.319 high energy density capacitors um
02:29:22.080 now they use the ruthenium
02:29:25.520 and tantalum which are ruthenium
02:29:28.000 especially quite rare
02:29:29.200 you cannot scale that because there's
02:29:30.560 not enough ruthenium where does that
02:29:32.080 come from
02:29:33.439 um it's a trace element it's uh
02:29:38.080 it's coming from like radioactive decay
02:29:39.680 and like uh
02:29:42.080 you know meteorites and that kind of
02:29:43.280 thing it's it's it's rare um
02:29:47.120 you know i think at the time like it was
02:29:48.960 only like it's like
02:29:51.920 impossible to scale it doesn't matter
02:29:53.439 how smart you get you can't scale
02:29:54.880 something if it's using ruthenium
02:29:57.120 um there's not enough of it uh it was
02:30:00.160 like rarer than gold
02:30:01.600 like it's way better for like trying to
02:30:03.280 make cars powered by gold
02:30:04.960 is there any argument that there's not
02:30:07.200 enough conflict minerals
02:30:08.640 to go around because that's what they
02:30:09.840 call it like conflict minerals things
02:30:11.600 like lithium
02:30:12.880 now lithium is extremely common is it
02:30:15.280 yeah lithium is everywhere
02:30:18.560 lithium is one of the most common
02:30:19.600 elements in the in the universe
02:30:22.000 it's at number three on the periodic
02:30:23.280 table so it's got a lithium ion pretty
02:30:25.439 much everywhere
02:30:26.640 where do we get it uh well i mean tesla
02:30:30.160 we get most of our lithium from
02:30:31.680 australia actually um so
02:30:35.200 um but it's you could get lithium from
02:30:38.160 seawater
02:30:38.880 if you wanted to it's really yes yeah
02:30:40.800 lithium is a it just forms assault
02:30:42.800 and that's the primary component of the
02:30:45.280 batteries or
02:30:46.160 what else is in there it's a misnomer
02:30:47.840 actually the it's called lithium
02:30:49.680 lithium ion but that's like that's like
02:30:51.760 the salt in the salad
02:30:53.040 you know it's like it's like do you like
02:30:54.240 salt in your salad sure but it's not
02:30:55.840 made of salt
02:30:59.359 uh the i mean the primary component in
02:31:02.880 lithium-ion batteries like in a tesla is
02:31:05.439 nickel
02:31:06.479 um and nickel is also relatively common
02:31:09.920 it's not super common iron is very
02:31:11.359 common so there's
02:31:12.399 that the two main schools
02:31:15.600 of of the main the two main types of
02:31:17.600 battery pack are
02:31:19.840 um iron and nickel and iron is very
02:31:23.040 common
02:31:23.760 uh so much eyes ridiculous amount of
02:31:25.840 iron just like this ridiculous amount of
02:31:27.359 lithium
02:31:28.160 now nickels a little a little more
02:31:30.399 unusual
02:31:31.439 still not not that unusual but it's uh
02:31:35.359 you know way way
02:31:38.399 much harder to get nickel and iron um
02:31:43.680 but for example stainless steel you know
02:31:45.680 that that'll be
02:31:48.080 you know i don't know 12 12 it's quote
02:31:51.120 10 to 20
02:31:51.920 nickel depending on the situation uh
02:31:55.280 like uh cutlery you know like knives and
02:31:58.880 forks will be like
02:32:00.479 electroplated nickel silver that's what
02:32:03.200 epns means
02:32:05.840 so so you got like nickel based
02:32:09.600 cells and you got iron-based cells
02:32:12.960 the nickel based cells have more energy
02:32:15.280 density like so for a given amount of
02:32:17.680 volume and mass you're going to get more
02:32:19.359 energy out of nickel and iron
02:32:22.880 iron is cheaper and so
02:32:26.399 anyway those are two two main types of
02:32:28.000 cells they've got a iron cathode
02:32:29.840 nickel cathode and then some of the
02:32:33.120 nickel cathodes have some amount of
02:32:34.960 cobalt to stabilize nickel and then iron
02:32:38.000 it's like they call it usually iron
02:32:39.120 phosphate you get like you know but it's
02:32:41.120 it's really mostly it's like like the
02:32:42.720 heavy stuff is iron and the heavy stuff
02:32:45.040 is nickel and the nickel based stuff so
02:32:47.359 your nickel iron and then you got the
02:32:48.399 anode side which is
02:32:51.040 um basically a carbon lattice with a
02:32:54.479 little bit of
02:32:55.840 uh silicon sometimes so and then these
02:32:59.120 these
02:32:59.920 these uh lithium ions they like they
02:33:02.479 they sort of trundle back and forth
02:33:04.640 between the cathode and the anode
02:33:08.800 so um
02:33:11.920 i just read the if you read the
02:33:13.359 wikipedia article on
02:33:15.520 destiny mines quite quite good um
02:33:18.800 anyway so
02:33:21.920 the the the the challenge like the rate
02:33:24.640 at which we are producing
02:33:26.479 what are what are called lithium ion
02:33:27.920 cells but really primarily iron and
02:33:29.680 nickel cells
02:33:31.200 uh is improv it's increasing very very
02:33:33.840 rapidly year over year
02:33:35.120 it's just that in order to uh
02:33:38.399 compensate for the rest for
02:33:41.439 for an economy which is fundamentally
02:33:43.200 based on fossil fuels
02:33:44.720 you need a [ __ ] ton of batteries
02:33:48.000 so a gigaton giga [ __ ] ton
02:33:51.840 of batteries and that is what uh
02:33:55.280 that's gonna happen it's just a question
02:33:56.720 when that's why i say like the
02:33:57.680 fundamental good of tesla
02:33:59.120 is to what degree it accelerates the
02:34:01.680 advent of sustainable energy it's uh
02:34:03.680 inevitable like either we have
02:34:05.439 sustainable energy is totally logical
02:34:07.760 it's either we have sustainable energy
02:34:09.200 or civilization collapses and so
02:34:11.760 if civilization doesn't collapse we will
02:34:13.359 have sustainable energy it's just a
02:34:14.800 question of how soon does that happen
02:34:17.280 sooner is better um
02:34:20.319 and then the you know the there's a risk
02:34:23.680 that we're incurring because of the
02:34:26.000 increased parts per million
02:34:27.760 of co2 in the oceans and atmosphere
02:34:30.800 um you know it has some acidification of
02:34:33.760 it makes the
02:34:34.800 water looks a little bit more acidic um
02:34:38.399 and uh you know and it just causes the
02:34:41.120 air to be a little warmer
02:34:42.800 not a lot i think sometimes people look
02:34:45.280 at the temperature
02:34:47.520 especially in celsius you might say like
02:34:50.080 okay it's like
02:34:51.600 20 degrees celsius i mean can a small
02:34:54.960 ppm increase
02:34:56.240 and carbon really moved the needle that
02:34:58.319 much
02:34:59.359 but but actually you should be looking
02:35:00.800 at it in degrees kelvin
02:35:02.800 so then it's like actually it's like
02:35:04.160 more like we're at around 300 kelvin
02:35:07.359 and so uh you know what would it take to
02:35:10.560 have like
02:35:11.359 only a point three percent increase
02:35:13.359 would be one degree
02:35:14.720 celsius two degrees fahrenheit so
02:35:17.200 therefore
02:35:18.319 this is actually you know it's it's more
02:35:22.560 it's a smaller percentage increase than
02:35:24.160 you'd think when looking at temperature
02:35:26.399 in the absolute as opposed to
02:35:28.640 you know above the freezing point of
02:35:30.160 water so
02:35:32.000 and and then if people weren't just
02:35:33.520 living right on the water
02:35:35.920 then that would also help a lot but it's
02:35:37.920 just like we love living right on the
02:35:39.600 water
02:35:40.479 so like the humanity is like a
02:35:42.880 thermometer
02:35:44.160 it's like you look like a thermometer
02:35:46.560 you know like a
02:35:47.840 you know that like like old-school sort
02:35:50.560 of analog thermometer which is like
02:35:53.040 you know to judge changing the
02:35:55.439 temperature as a function of like some
02:35:56.880 liquid that is
02:35:58.080 uh increasing its volume due to
02:36:00.160 temperature and it only takes a little
02:36:01.680 bit of small increase in volume
02:36:03.520 uh to raise the temperature you know on
02:36:06.160 an old-school analog liquid
02:36:08.399 thermometer and and humanity's like that
02:36:10.880 we we've just decided that we want to
02:36:12.800 ride on the damn beach yep so because
02:36:16.080 the beach is cool
02:36:17.359 now the problem is you're right you see
02:36:19.040 you you're like what's
02:36:20.880 it's kind of like if we wanted to say
02:36:22.399 what's the most sensitive instrument you
02:36:24.399 could
02:36:24.720 like how can we maximize our sensitivity
02:36:27.760 to
02:36:28.160 to water level we'll live right on the
02:36:30.399 right on the ocean
02:36:32.000 okay we just did that yeah and and then
02:36:34.160 it's like
02:36:35.439 and then it's like okay well you know
02:36:39.359 and by the way like throughout history
02:36:41.600 like the water level is varied a lot
02:36:43.920 like it's like nutty how much it's
02:36:45.680 buried um
02:36:48.240 so and then if you look at say the co2
02:36:50.960 parchment million
02:36:52.319 you know based on the fossil record i
02:36:53.840 mean it just looks like a wall
02:36:55.920 um i i'm not like a doomsayer here i'm
02:36:59.200 like
02:36:59.920 my view is that if um
02:37:03.359 provided we are not complacent about
02:37:06.800 a sustainable energy economy i think
02:37:08.479 things will be fine if we are complacent
02:37:10.640 about it that's where problems arise
02:37:12.720 so like to be totally frank i think
02:37:16.720 we'll be fine
02:37:18.319 but as long as we don't behave as though
02:37:21.439 we're going to be fine
02:37:22.399 we will be fine yeah don't
02:37:25.600 if we don't take it for granted if we're
02:37:27.359 not complacent
02:37:29.359 i think we'll be fine do you anticipate
02:37:32.319 any large
02:37:33.200 leaps in in in battery technology
02:37:36.560 like is is there anything that can be
02:37:38.479 done to increase the efficiency
02:37:40.880 increase the the manufacturing abilities
02:37:44.640 like
02:37:45.200 what what can be done to
02:37:49.680 to to move that
02:37:58.840 so
02:38:04.399 the ball is in motion in this like like
02:38:06.479 the the good things that are happening
02:38:08.399 are happening like the the the rate at
02:38:11.280 which we are making new
02:38:12.960 we're increasing the production capacity
02:38:14.800 of batteries it's it's
02:38:16.800 increasing at a rate of that i think we
02:38:19.120 haven't seen
02:38:20.960 in a century it's like it's crazy fast
02:38:26.160 it's just that in order to change from a
02:38:28.479 fossil fuel economy to
02:38:30.479 um kind of like a solar wind
02:38:34.880 uh battery economy uh it just
02:38:38.560 a hell of a lot of batteries needed um
02:38:42.560 now it would it would i mean my top
02:38:44.640 recommendation honestly would be
02:38:46.479 just to have a carbon tax like the
02:38:48.880 economy works great
02:38:50.399 like prices and money are just
02:38:53.040 information
02:38:55.040 prices or information if the price is
02:38:57.359 wrong
02:38:58.080 the economy doesn't do the right thing
02:39:00.560 so we got
02:39:01.680 basically an unpriced externality in the
02:39:05.120 carbon concentration in the oceans and
02:39:07.120 atmosphere
02:39:08.240 like it's a it's kind of like not paying
02:39:10.479 like if you're
02:39:11.359 not paying for for garbage removal or
02:39:13.520 something like okay everyone's going to
02:39:14.720 throw garbage in the street
02:39:16.240 it's like garbage removal is free um but
02:39:18.880 it's like
02:39:19.600 there's a little bit of like okay
02:39:21.200 garbage removal isn't free we've got to
02:39:22.560 pay a little bit for this
02:39:24.640 and because we're not paying for the co2
02:39:27.840 capacity of the oceans and atmosphere we
02:39:29.600 have
02:39:30.319 what in economics uh is called an
02:39:32.960 unpriced externality
02:39:34.880 so the market is unable to respond to an
02:39:38.000 unpriced externality if we just put a
02:39:40.880 price on it the market will
02:39:42.399 react in a sensible way
02:39:45.439 but because we don't have a price in it
02:39:47.120 and it's doing just
02:39:49.040 behaving badly so theoretically how
02:39:50.800 would you put a price on that like would
02:39:52.080 you
02:39:52.319 look look at various industries and how
02:39:54.560 they contribute to the co2
02:39:57.120 yeah i mean just put it at the point of
02:39:58.960 consumption and tax it
02:40:00.640 it ends up being yeah electricity and
02:40:03.120 gasoline
02:40:04.080 pretty much now you could make this a
02:40:06.479 non-aggressive tax you could say like
02:40:07.840 okay well
02:40:08.479 you know what if somebody's like driving
02:40:10.080 around a lot and they're low income
02:40:11.600 it's like eight great give them a rebate
02:40:13.760 you know so it's like
02:40:16.640 give a tax rebate that's the way to do
02:40:18.840 it um
02:40:20.960 and then the market will be forced to
02:40:22.640 respond to the fact that the
02:40:24.399 the market just does things
02:40:25.680 automatically based on pricing
02:40:27.920 so markets work great if the pricing is
02:40:30.319 correct
02:40:31.359 it's only when something you have a
02:40:33.520 tragedy of the commons
02:40:35.279 and the price is not there that the
02:40:37.840 market does not respond or nor would you
02:40:39.680 expect it to
02:40:41.760 you know so if you if you have like the
02:40:45.279 public toilets problem where it's like
02:40:46.960 nobody's responsible for it
02:40:48.560 nobody's paying for it it's like okay
02:40:50.240 well probably toilets are not good
02:40:54.720 so as soon as you put a price on it the
02:40:57.439 right thing will happen automatically
02:41:00.880 has there been a response to this like
02:41:02.560 is is is this something i
02:41:04.399 i talked to the biden administration
02:41:05.680 incoming administration and they they
02:41:07.120 were like well
02:41:08.560 this seems to politically difficult and
02:41:10.479 i was like well this is obviously a
02:41:12.240 thing that should happen and by the way
02:41:13.600 spacex would be paying
02:41:14.960 a carbon tax too sure so i'm like you
02:41:17.520 know i'm like
02:41:18.560 i think we should pay it too it's not
02:41:20.560 like uh
02:41:21.920 it's not like we shouldn't have karma
02:41:23.600 generating things it just there's god it
02:41:25.279 should be a price on this stuff
02:41:26.960 and that would encourage people to make
02:41:29.439 either carbon
02:41:30.080 neutral automatically fix the problem
02:41:33.200 no for sure you know just think about
02:41:36.000 like taxes
02:41:37.279 it's like you know here we are drinking
02:41:39.120 alcohol
02:41:40.800 now taxes on alcohol and tobacco are
02:41:43.600 higher
02:41:44.240 than on let's say fruit and vegetables
02:41:48.399 okay because everyone knows like fruit
02:41:50.960 and vegetables are good for you
02:41:52.640 and alcohol and tobacco are not good for
02:41:55.680 you nice
02:41:57.120 yeah so we're like yeah you should
02:41:58.960 probably buy us the taxes towards
02:42:01.520 alcohol and tobacco
02:42:03.359 have higher taxes on alcohol and tobacco
02:42:06.080 and lower taxes on fruits and vegetables
02:42:08.319 that's just sensible like same thing
02:42:10.880 goes for
02:42:11.439 energy um
02:42:14.640 yeah that seems very reasonable i don't
02:42:16.479 understand how that would be
02:42:17.760 politically difficult i don't know i
02:42:19.439 talked to the incoming biden
02:42:20.479 administration i was like i thought well
02:42:22.080 for sure like this
02:42:23.279 you know i mean it's like half the
02:42:24.720 reason they got elected and even some
02:42:26.240 sort of an incremental
02:42:27.520 increase over time yeah exactly we don't
02:42:30.160 need to join people
02:42:31.279 yeah just say just if you just say it's
02:42:33.279 coming people will automatically
02:42:35.600 make the changes that seems so
02:42:37.840 reasonable
02:42:38.880 yeah i agree and they were like
02:42:42.560 they thought it was like too politically
02:42:44.000 difficult and i'm like uh
02:42:45.840 i mean i don't know man i think that's
02:42:47.359 like half at least half the reason you
02:42:48.800 got elected so
02:42:49.760 why don't you just fight for that you
02:42:51.120 know yeah it's it's a factor it's
02:42:53.680 the the the the optics were that they're
02:42:55.920 the more reasonable
02:42:57.040 people they're going to bring us back to
02:42:58.399 the paris climate accord and
02:43:00.080 the the whole yeah i mean the thing is
02:43:03.200 like the paris record
02:43:04.160 that this is just a piece of paper
02:43:05.600 unless you do something about it
02:43:08.720 i mean apparently the it's not like the
02:43:11.680 paris accord is
02:43:12.880 yeah it's pretty much toothless you know
02:43:15.200 and and even if we did that
02:43:17.120 thing it's like probably still not
02:43:18.399 enough there's just one thing that will
02:43:20.720 matter
02:43:21.120 put a price on carbon that would be the
02:43:23.600 best option for sure
02:43:25.279 um that seems like it'd be such a good
02:43:28.319 idea
02:43:29.359 i mean i think it's it's an obvious move
02:43:31.439 and if you if you just call up like
02:43:33.680 you know say like top economists like
02:43:36.319 just do a poll of
02:43:37.600 like what do 90 percent of economists
02:43:39.920 think and like
02:43:40.720 they all agree okay we should do that
02:43:43.040 well also if you think about the
02:43:44.319 variability of gas prices
02:43:46.880 it changes so much like how about the
02:43:49.040 difference between gas
02:43:50.479 in california versus gas in texas
02:43:53.520 yeah giant difference giant difference
02:43:55.760 yeah and you know by the way i i i'm
02:43:58.160 actually
02:43:58.800 not in favor of like demonizing the oil
02:44:01.520 and gas industry
02:44:02.880 because like we can't like stop
02:44:04.920 instantaneously and not have
02:44:07.200 oil and gas right you know like
02:44:10.399 we'll like die of starvation basically
02:44:12.560 so that's always the argument against it
02:44:14.960 right
02:44:16.080 we need fossil fuels and this is sort of
02:44:18.000 the short-sighted argument
02:44:20.319 we we we're going to need to burn fossil
02:44:23.279 fuels for a long time
02:44:24.720 the question is just what at what rate
02:44:27.359 do we move to a sustainable energy
02:44:29.040 future
02:44:30.000 um so i think we should
02:44:33.840 probably move there faster than slower
02:44:36.160 but it's you know
02:44:37.359 um but but i i mean the current approach
02:44:41.359 is is basically just to demonize
02:44:45.120 oil and gas and i'm like okay well
02:44:48.080 obviously and
02:44:48.800 you know there are people who spent
02:44:50.080 their whole career in oil and gas and
02:44:51.600 they started out in that career
02:44:53.040 when it wasn't doesn't seem like that
02:44:54.479 bad of a thing to do right so then like
02:44:56.800 so then they're like hey man i just
02:44:58.640 spent my whole career working hard to
02:45:00.800 do useful things and now you're telling
02:45:02.240 me i'm the devil i mean that that's like
02:45:04.560 gonna make him pretty upset you know so
02:45:08.319 i say like instead of demonizing oil and
02:45:10.319 gas which also they should stop lobbying
02:45:12.880 against the carbon tax
02:45:14.640 by the way then just like
02:45:18.080 honestly the smartest thing the oil and
02:45:19.600 gas industry could do would say
02:45:21.279 let's do a carbon tax and and then we'll
02:45:23.760 just do a carbon tax and it make us not
02:45:25.680 the devil
02:45:26.800 meg is not the devil they'll still make
02:45:28.160 a [ __ ] load of money so we'll be fine
02:45:30.080 they'll be fine yeah that seems so
02:45:34.000 reasonable i can't imagine
02:45:35.840 how anybody would argue against that
02:45:37.439 that's what i thought i don't know
02:45:39.120 i think the white administration should
02:45:40.399 take a strong stance on this situation
02:45:42.720 what political candidates endorsed a
02:45:45.040 carbon tax
02:45:45.920 did bernie sanders endorse a carbon tax
02:45:48.319 i don't know you might have
02:45:51.600 um it seems super reasonable
02:45:55.600 i mean i mean like i kind of like even
02:45:58.240 though he's a communist i kind of like
02:45:59.520 bernie sanders
02:46:01.279 yeah i like him too yeah he's a i think
02:46:04.399 he's
02:46:05.439 yeah i think he means well yeah i think
02:46:07.600 he means well the best part about him
02:46:09.760 and he's been remarkably consistent and
02:46:12.479 meaning well his whole life
02:46:14.319 and they kept [ __ ] throwing them
02:46:16.479 right under the bus
02:46:17.520 yeah absolutely two election cycles in a
02:46:20.560 row
02:46:21.359 yeah i think it is larry's that he like
02:46:23.120 went to like the soviet union like three
02:46:25.279 days after his wedding
02:46:26.560 for like 10 days he was like
02:46:30.000 a mayor of a city and i guess i'm here
02:46:32.160 in vermont i'm like
02:46:33.279 yo dude like how do you explain day 6 to
02:46:36.840 10.
02:46:39.120 don't you get it didn't you see
02:46:41.520 everything you needed
02:46:42.319 for a long time will the kgb interviews
02:46:45.520 take that long
02:46:52.160 yeah carbon tax seems like the most
02:46:54.880 reasonable thing that anyone could ever
02:46:57.600 ask of uh an industry that
02:47:00.880 is without a doubt causing some problems
02:47:03.760 i mean there's no
02:47:05.359 no one's saying it doesn't cause
02:47:06.720 problems people will deny
02:47:08.640 the extent of the problem yeah but no
02:47:10.560 one says that excess co2
02:47:12.479 from you know from emissions is not an
02:47:15.439 issue
02:47:15.920 no i mean like like like exxon's
02:47:19.920 own scientists said uh in like the i
02:47:22.880 think it was like the late 70s like we
02:47:24.479 think there might be a problem
02:47:26.160 here with climate change due to the co2
02:47:29.279 it's like internal their own documents
02:47:31.439 their own people
02:47:32.319 then they were like be quiet isn't it
02:47:34.720 weird when
02:47:35.359 environmental things become political
02:47:36.880 though when the denial of the
02:47:38.319 environmental thing is like
02:47:39.439 predominantly from
02:47:40.720 from some factions of the right and then
02:47:44.160 you know like the the opposite is from
02:47:46.240 some factions and then it becomes a
02:47:47.520 political thing so they dig their heels
02:47:48.960 in the sand
02:47:50.160 and they're like no no this is this is
02:47:52.800 this is fine this is the way the
02:47:54.560 the earth is a there's a cycle a natural
02:47:56.880 cycle
02:47:57.760 and it becomes this mantra that they
02:48:00.000 repeat
02:48:00.880 it's true there is a natural cycle but
02:48:02.560 that does not explain the situation
02:48:04.240 right
02:48:04.880 um it's a wall man yeah i mean you just
02:48:08.000 look at
02:48:08.560 carbon parts per million and it just
02:48:10.880 looks like a wall
02:48:11.840 like that it just you know goes like
02:48:14.160 blah blah blah
02:48:15.200 you know uh two to three hundred parts
02:48:17.520 per million bam 400
02:48:19.760 out of nowhere there's also some weird
02:48:21.920 arguments that some people will make
02:48:23.600 in terms of the impact that it has
02:48:26.640 on uh on plant life and that it actually
02:48:30.319 is making the earth greener
02:48:31.920 oh i think that's actually true yeah
02:48:33.840 yeah
02:48:35.040 yeah but that's not necessarily okay
02:48:38.479 still causes problems yeah i mean i'm
02:48:40.720 trying to be like
02:48:41.600 as precise i mean or at least um
02:48:45.600 uh the least amount wrong that i can be
02:48:48.640 i'm trying to be the least amount wrong
02:48:50.240 because um plants live off carbon
02:48:52.000 dioxide so the more
02:48:54.160 more co2 well it does improve plant
02:48:57.120 growth it's true
02:48:58.160 yeah like i said i don't think
02:49:02.960 based on where we are provided we're not
02:49:05.120 complacent provided we don't take things
02:49:07.200 for granted
02:49:08.080 i think we'll be fine but if we're
02:49:10.960 complacent and we take things for
02:49:12.399 granted and we just proceed like
02:49:13.680 everything's fine
02:49:15.359 um and we continue on the momentum
02:49:18.880 of co2 emissions
02:49:21.920 we're taking a big risk um
02:49:25.040 and the especially big risk is if
02:49:27.279 there's a non-linear event
02:49:29.439 okay so the co2 ppm parts per million
02:49:32.800 has been increasing you know pretty
02:49:35.920 reliably two or three ppm per year
02:49:39.279 but you could have a non-linear event
02:49:43.120 what would constitute a non-linear event
02:49:45.600 if we melt the siberian tundra
02:49:49.359 there's like a massive amount of trapped
02:49:52.479 gas
02:49:53.120 and and dead plant matter that's frozen
02:49:55.600 solid
02:49:56.960 now if that warms up
02:50:01.200 and and that decays and that that that
02:50:03.120 could put a massive amount of co2 into
02:50:04.960 the atmosphere
02:50:06.840 potentially um
02:50:09.120 and then you have like how we like
02:50:12.560 room what are the carbon sinks and like
02:50:14.560 if you saturate the carbon sinks
02:50:16.560 and you have like a sudden release
02:50:20.000 of co2 um
02:50:23.040 from something that was previously
02:50:24.319 frozen solid that's where you could have
02:50:26.560 a non-linearity and things could go
02:50:28.640 haywire pretty fast what could happen
02:50:30.240 then
02:50:32.160 yes i mean earth would heat up before
02:50:35.200 water level would rise
02:50:37.439 uh you'd have you'd have a higher
02:50:38.960 probability of extreme weather events
02:50:41.439 um sure we hit the fan
02:50:45.600 [ __ ] we did the fan sure hit the fan
02:50:47.920 like i'm not saying for sure she would
02:50:49.439 hit the fan but i'm saying like the
02:50:50.720 probability
02:50:52.399 increases with time
02:50:55.439 so you can't just change the the
02:50:58.399 chemical makeup of the atmosphere and
02:51:00.000 oceans and expect nothing's gonna happen
02:51:01.680 this is just a chemical reaction man
02:51:03.760 it's like
02:51:05.840 yeah so is there anything it's like why
02:51:08.479 are we even running this experiment
02:51:09.760 right so the crazy thing is like hey we
02:51:11.760 need we know we need to have a
02:51:13.279 sustainable energy economy long term
02:51:15.120 because we're going to run out oil
02:51:17.760 so so then we got we're running this
02:51:20.640 crazy experiment to see
02:51:22.560 what is the effect of massively of
02:51:24.800 taking
02:51:25.680 billions of tons of carbon that was deep
02:51:28.080 underground putting in the atmosphere
02:51:30.160 and oceans and and and what's going to
02:51:32.640 happen as a result that
02:51:34.399 and and it's a crazy it's like literally
02:51:38.000 the craziest experiment in human history
02:51:40.240 because
02:51:40.880 we know no matter what that we have to
02:51:44.560 have a sustainable energy future we have
02:51:46.880 to because otherwise
02:51:48.319 civilization will collapse so what the
02:51:50.800 hell are we running this experiment for
02:51:53.920 because we're accustomed to doing things
02:51:55.600 a certain way this is going to go down
02:51:58.000 as the most foolish
02:51:59.520 experiment in the history of human
02:52:00.880 civilization
02:52:02.640 is it possible to create some sort of
02:52:05.279 carbon extraction technology
02:52:07.200 that will significantly impact the
02:52:08.800 amount of co2 that's in the air
02:52:11.600 or or mitigate the emissions
02:52:19.200 yeah i mean so i just actually uh
02:52:22.080 announced that
02:52:23.040 i'm funding this 100 million dollar
02:52:24.880 common capture prize
02:52:27.040 to find out the answer to that question
02:52:29.680 um
02:52:30.399 so right now all of the carbon capture
02:52:32.240 methods that we're aware of
02:52:34.080 uh are very expensive the cost per ton
02:52:36.399 is very expensive and then even if
02:52:38.000 money is not an issue you have to say
02:52:39.279 okay how much wind or solar energy was
02:52:42.000 required to pull carbon out of the
02:52:45.040 uh atmosphere um
02:52:48.240 and and like i don't know make it in
02:52:49.760 solid form like like make a cube of it
02:52:51.760 or something you know just a giant cube
02:52:54.840 um i we don't actually know the answer
02:52:58.080 to that question
02:52:59.200 that's why i'm giving 100 million
02:53:01.359 dollars to this carbon capture price
02:53:03.439 to try to get a better answer wasn't
02:53:05.279 there there's nothing good that we're
02:53:06.880 aware of right now not currently
02:53:08.560 not currently that world because there's
02:53:09.920 a point of diminishing returns the
02:53:11.200 amount of energy that you would need
02:53:13.520 you need basically a co2
02:53:17.359 has a very low energy state and
02:53:19.600 naturally so it's like you burn
02:53:20.880 something you combine oxygen
02:53:23.200 with fuel with with hydrocarbons and
02:53:26.880 the net result is co2 and h2o or
02:53:30.000 basically and there's a bunch of other
02:53:31.120 stuff too but primarily it's carbon
02:53:32.640 dioxide and
02:53:34.080 water mostly carbon dioxide
02:53:37.840 uh so so like it obviously it goes from
02:53:41.600 a high energy state we use that to power
02:53:43.840 our cars or our power plants and then it
02:53:45.520 ends up in a low energy state which is
02:53:47.359 co2 in the atmosphere
02:53:48.880 and then like i said once it gets in the
02:53:50.479 ocean
02:53:51.920 so um
02:53:55.359 naturally that it therefore requires a
02:53:56.880 lot of energy to rebind that
02:53:59.040 in solid form it doesn't want to just
02:54:02.000 it's not gonna
02:54:02.800 you've got to put a lot of energy in to
02:54:04.399 bind it and and then
02:54:06.080 you want it to be something that's going
02:54:07.279 to be stable in solid form for a long
02:54:09.600 time
02:54:10.240 this is a hard problem
02:54:13.840 the there was a concept i don't know if
02:54:16.640 it was implemented but
02:54:17.840 in china they developed essentially like
02:54:20.000 a giant building
02:54:21.279 that was uh you know you wear this
02:54:25.040 it was i don't know if they actually did
02:54:26.880 it did they want
02:54:28.640 we talked about this before jamie did
02:54:30.240 they ever wind up doing that
02:54:31.840 it was like a building that was
02:54:33.120 essentially a giant air filter
02:54:36.160 and they were going to use it but that
02:54:37.680 might have been about particulates
02:54:39.840 more than it was about that co2 maybe
02:54:42.880 more of a
02:54:43.439 i by the way i have to be you know
02:54:47.120 say a good word here for for china china
02:54:49.439 is
02:54:50.160 has them some of them for any large
02:54:53.840 economy has the most progressive
02:54:56.160 pro-environmental
02:54:57.359 rules of any large economy really yeah
02:55:00.800 they're like super supportive elect of
02:55:02.560 electric vehicles of solar power of wind
02:55:05.279 they actually even made a giant solar
02:55:07.200 field in the shape of a panda
02:55:09.279 which is pretty cute uh
02:55:12.479 so and it's actually funny it happened
02:55:14.800 like for for a long time china was like
02:55:16.479 not
02:55:17.359 uh you know it was not buying into the
02:55:19.279 carbon thing
02:55:20.399 uh you know like they're like oh it's
02:55:21.760 just like a bunch of soft westerners
02:55:23.680 they're like uh
02:55:25.120 they're just a bunch of environmental
02:55:26.800 softies um
02:55:28.319 and then at some point like senior
02:55:29.840 members of the chinese government they
02:55:31.040 they
02:55:31.439 you know say well let's like ask the you
02:55:34.240 know
02:55:34.560 engineering professors like at the
02:55:37.120 universities like what do they think
02:55:38.560 they're like oh yeah no it's definitely
02:55:39.760 real like wait you mean it's real
02:55:42.319 like they're like yeah yeah it's real so
02:55:44.000 then like holy [ __ ]
02:55:45.520 immediate change well that's the power
02:55:48.479 of having the government
02:55:49.680 and business inexorably intertwined
02:55:52.720 yeah they can kind of decide how
02:55:54.479 business is going to react and what's
02:55:56.000 going to happen
02:55:57.200 right yeah i think people don't realize
02:55:58.960 china is super pro
02:56:00.479 environment right now like way more than
02:56:02.319 america is that the thing the skyscraper
02:56:04.640 size air purifier
02:56:06.560 is the world's tallest look at that
02:56:09.600 thing
02:56:10.399 so that's an air purifier but that's the
02:56:12.319 thing is like is that pulling
02:56:13.520 particulates out of the atmosphere
02:56:15.359 or is that actually taking carbon out
02:56:17.920 you know
02:56:18.560 an air purifier air purifier not
02:56:21.920 uh it's super hard to capture carbon
02:56:24.240 look at that though
02:56:25.279 jesus christ imagine falling into that
02:56:28.960 yeah i mean naturally it's just
02:56:31.359 fundamental
02:56:32.640 thermodynamics like you know you
02:56:35.359 released a lot of energy
02:56:36.560 that resulted in the co2 so now you
02:56:39.520 gotta
02:56:40.640 use a lot of energy to capture it um
02:56:43.200 yeah
02:56:44.000 um made a particulate matter no bigger
02:56:46.479 than 2.5 microns in diameter
02:56:49.040 yeah yeah that that's like a hard it's
02:56:51.920 particularly difficult to filter two
02:56:53.359 microns
02:56:55.600 oh you know so i don't know most people
02:56:58.080 probably don't know but
02:57:00.000 like a model s and x have a hospital
02:57:03.200 grade hepa filters
02:57:04.319 uh so and they'll they'll actually drop
02:57:07.359 uh the two micron ppm level to
02:57:10.800 almost undetectable in the car really
02:57:14.000 yeah so if you're in some sort of a
02:57:15.920 biological disaster area
02:57:18.160 you can drive through your tesla yes
02:57:21.200 it's literally this like bio has a
02:57:22.960 defense mode where it basically
02:57:25.120 pressurizes the car so it's like like
02:57:27.439 the car is
02:57:28.399 is at under positive pressure with all
02:57:30.720 the air coming through
02:57:32.720 a a gigantic hepa filter and then even
02:57:36.319 the air
02:57:36.960 in inside the car is recirculating in a
02:57:39.520 secondary filter
02:57:40.800 it's got the most advanced filtration
02:57:42.479 system of any car by far
02:57:44.319 literally hospital grade wow you could
02:57:46.399 do an operation in the car
02:57:48.080 it's insane that's awesome yeah we got a
02:57:50.399 little carried away
02:57:52.640 i'm glad you get carried away you know
02:57:54.560 the other thing i thought is that
02:57:55.439 jamie's got the
02:57:56.240 x and one of the things that i love
02:57:57.840 about the x is when it gets hit they
02:57:59.600 literally
02:58:00.080 can't flip over oh yeah yeah it's like
02:58:03.279 one of those like things that you if you
02:58:04.640 you know like where you punch the thing
02:58:06.000 it just
02:58:06.560 comes back up yeah yeah those like that
02:58:09.359 they they
02:58:09.920 they couldn't flip it over in the test
02:58:12.080 so they would like
02:58:13.439 roll on its side and they roll back i
02:58:15.439 know it's amazing very low center of
02:58:17.120 gravity
02:58:18.319 um so that's giant
02:58:22.000 yeah that is so [ __ ] funny it's nice
02:58:25.439 it just rolls back on i mean um
02:58:28.479 there's not another car like that in the
02:58:30.319 world no every other car in the world
02:58:32.399 would would just
02:58:33.680 [ __ ] roll it's pretty amazing man
02:58:36.560 yeah even if you did
02:58:37.680 manage to bang it on the on the roof uh
02:58:39.680 it like you can stack like five cars on
02:58:42.160 top of a model
02:58:42.960 model s or x wow now are you guys still
02:58:45.760 making the x
02:58:47.520 yeah you're still going to do crazy
02:58:49.120 doors the crazy doors that those doors
02:58:51.840 are exercising hubris
02:58:54.240 that's for sure well that's a lot of
02:58:56.640 things you do
02:58:57.520 is an exercise in hubris well some
02:59:00.319 things like
02:59:01.439 where some things are really important
02:59:02.960 and necessary some things are
02:59:06.000 you know uh
02:59:09.600 some things are not necessary so the
02:59:12.240 doors
02:59:12.720 but the thing is those doors are not
02:59:14.160 necessary but they're very cool
02:59:16.000 functional though if like you're in a
02:59:17.439 tight spot those doors will open up
02:59:19.680 uh yeah tighter than almost any door
02:59:22.720 out there like you even they'll open up
02:59:25.760 in 18 inches you've got an 18 inch gap
02:59:27.760 between you and the next car that door
02:59:29.279 will open that's pretty amazing
02:59:30.880 so um
02:59:34.479 we developed a i mean just in order to
02:59:36.800 avoid
02:59:37.840 having a a puck like an ultrasonic puck
02:59:41.040 in the door
02:59:41.760 we developed the uh that's the best of
02:59:43.359 my knowledge what's an ultrasonic puck
02:59:45.279 so like this the the the
02:59:48.479 ultrasonic sensors that you have in a
02:59:49.840 car if you look carefully you'll see
02:59:51.120 that there's a little puck
02:59:52.160 like a little um isolation ring like a
02:59:54.720 rubber isolation ring and
02:59:56.720 that's when the the sonar which is like
02:59:58.640 basically a loudspeaker
02:59:59.840 is generating ultrasonic noise and it's
03:00:03.040 uh
03:00:03.520 and then listening to the echoes but but
03:00:06.240 normally in order to
03:00:07.600 listen to the echoes you've got to
03:00:09.359 isolate the the thing that's generating
03:00:11.359 the sound
03:00:12.000 so that's why if you look carefully
03:00:13.200 around round
03:00:15.040 cars you'll see these little pucks these
03:00:16.640 little circles and those are the
03:00:18.479 ultrasonic sensors
03:00:20.080 and we didn't want to have an ultra
03:00:21.600 exact name so we didn't want to have an
03:00:23.600 ultrasonic sensor in the door but we
03:00:25.279 also didn't want the door to like
03:00:26.640 you know bat some kid out of the way you
03:00:28.240 know like just
03:00:31.920 you know there's a hay maker or
03:00:32.960 something right so we
03:00:35.439 uh we developed the best of my knowledge
03:00:37.520 the only ultrasonic sensor that can
03:00:39.680 uh see through metal uh so it's it's
03:00:42.800 it's mounted on the on the inside of the
03:00:45.040 door
03:00:46.560 on on isolation mounts and it's super
03:00:49.359 loud and then it's got cancellation
03:00:51.520 it's because it's kind of basically
03:00:53.040 screaming at itself and it's listening
03:00:54.880 for a tiny echo on the other side of the
03:00:57.279 metal
03:00:57.920 just to avoid having a little rubber
03:01:00.880 ring
03:01:01.439 in the bottom of the door jesus christ
03:01:04.080 yeah
03:01:05.040 we put in a capacitive sensor an
03:01:06.880 inductive sensor force feedback sensor
03:01:10.000 and and ultrasonics that can see through
03:01:12.000 metal
03:01:13.120 this is when i say exercise and hubris i
03:01:15.920 mean like
03:01:16.479 wow is that the most ridiculous car
03:01:18.800 you've created
03:01:19.600 yeah this is a favorite the model x is
03:01:21.680 the favorite egg of cars
03:01:24.000 it's crazy um i mean for
03:01:27.680 for like the the six seaters like for
03:01:30.319 the
03:01:30.960 the seats the the seats are on a
03:01:34.560 rear inclined single post
03:01:37.760 um with the the seat movement mechanism
03:01:41.600 hidden in the floor so if you open the
03:01:43.600 door and you look through it's
03:01:45.520 completely clean it's just like the
03:01:47.840 floor is like a knife edge it's just
03:01:49.920 there's nothing else like it never it's
03:01:52.800 crazy
03:01:53.840 that that windscreen is like a
03:01:55.279 helicopter it's like a helicopter
03:01:56.960 windscreen
03:01:58.319 and there's no place to put the to
03:02:00.880 attach
03:02:01.439 the sun visors so we have to have
03:02:04.800 sun visors that that nest in the a
03:02:07.279 pillar
03:02:08.080 rotate forward have a magnetic and a
03:02:11.439 magnetic attachment that pops out and it
03:02:14.160 and and
03:02:14.720 and connects to the rear view mirror
03:02:18.319 but you seem very proud of all that
03:02:21.600 you say all these details and they sound
03:02:23.840 really crazy but
03:02:24.880 that's great it's pretty awesome i mean
03:02:27.520 the sound system on the x
03:02:29.120 is awesome um i mean we designed
03:02:33.040 so that the sound system is taking into
03:02:34.960 account the fact that the windscreen
03:02:36.960 is like a giant like you know a
03:02:39.920 subwoofer
03:02:40.640 resonator it's like a windscreen is a
03:02:42.640 resonator for the
03:02:44.000 sound system it's the sound system is
03:02:47.040 epic in the in the x it's good on the s2
03:02:50.000 it's even better in the new s
03:02:52.479 have you thought about doing a plaid x
03:02:55.279 yeah there's gonna be a platex too
03:02:56.960 yeah when's that coming which is like
03:02:58.800 bizarrely fast for an suv
03:03:00.800 that's coming out isn't it already
03:03:02.240 bizarrely fast you said it was
03:03:03.520 preposterous right
03:03:05.279 yeah it's it's like it really
03:03:08.800 it's like those things too fast it's too
03:03:11.120 fast probably have you increased the
03:03:12.560 range
03:03:13.040 of the x like what is the range of the x
03:03:15.200 currently it's like 300 something
03:03:17.120 yeah three or something so it'll be like
03:03:18.880 uh high 300s
03:03:21.200 yeah and is the the difference the
03:03:23.200 between the x and the
03:03:24.399 s the aerodynamics like what is uh what
03:03:27.120 what will you say
03:03:28.479 the x weighs more and it's got a bigger
03:03:30.720 cross-sectional area
03:03:32.000 so the the something called the cda drag
03:03:33.920 efficient drag coefficient times
03:03:35.520 uh frontal area is higher for the x as
03:03:38.399 you'd expect
03:03:39.439 and um the weight is higher so
03:03:42.800 it's going to be yeah 10 to 15 percent
03:03:45.760 uh less range for the same battery pack
03:03:47.439 as the s
03:03:48.160 the first time i saw an x tiffany hash
03:03:50.000 had one and she was in the comedy store
03:03:51.439 parking lot and she had it dancing for
03:03:53.040 us
03:03:53.680 oh yeah playing music and dancing like
03:03:55.520 this a lot of people don't know that
03:03:56.880 that the model x can do this crazy like
03:03:59.200 ballet thing with the [ __ ] dances
03:04:02.000 oh yeah with the doors we're going up
03:04:03.840 and down and the music's playing and we
03:04:05.279 were all dancing in the parking lot to
03:04:06.880 this car yeah
03:04:08.960 it's crazy um what is your do you have a
03:04:12.479 favorite that you've created
03:04:14.880 car i mean or yeah um not rocket
03:04:18.479 that's a little
03:04:29.040 well the car i drive every day
03:04:33.760 or tend to drive is the high performance
03:04:37.040 model s and like the model the hi
03:04:40.080 so the model i said i basically just
03:04:41.920 said i don't know what other people like
03:04:43.279 but i know what i love
03:04:44.720 and i want to just make a car that's the
03:04:46.479 car that i love
03:04:47.760 and hopefully there'll be enough people
03:04:49.760 out there who also love the car
03:04:52.000 so that's the reason i love the model s
03:04:54.720 is because i just designed the car that
03:04:56.080 i would love
03:04:57.439 that's it and then it's like okay well
03:05:00.399 how can we use a lot of the same
03:05:01.520 technology to also create an suv
03:05:04.319 um you know because a lot of people like
03:05:05.680 an suv and like you got more seats and
03:05:08.000 more room and a higher you know you see
03:05:11.520 that sitting higher
03:05:12.960 um so well what cool things what a
03:05:16.479 little cool
03:05:17.040 i mean like i said exercising hubris we
03:05:18.640 just got carried away like what are all
03:05:19.840 the cool things we can think of
03:05:21.680 in the if we're for an suv
03:05:25.920 or you know friends and i had a lot of
03:05:28.080 discussions about this
03:05:30.840 um you know and jv
03:05:33.359 struggled back in the day and drew back
03:05:36.080 leno
03:05:36.560 and um jerome and
03:05:40.240 there's a lot of a lot of talented
03:05:41.600 people now it has this relative a lot of
03:05:43.840 talented people that's for sure
03:05:50.960 the car that's the most fun to show for
03:05:52.399 others is the model x for sure
03:05:55.600 so it's a great car
03:05:59.120 but i thought like you know is this
03:06:02.160 really part of our mission to
03:06:03.840 like we're trying to the mission from
03:06:05.520 tesla from the beginning
03:06:07.200 uh has been to accelerate the advent of
03:06:09.920 sustainable
03:06:10.800 energy so are we really doing the right
03:06:13.840 thing
03:06:14.319 by creating this faberge egg of course
03:06:16.240 with the model x
03:06:18.080 uh real let me do totally frank it's not
03:06:21.200 entirely consistent with our mission
03:06:22.720 because there's too many bells and
03:06:23.760 whistles yeah but isn't it though
03:06:25.359 because americans love
03:06:26.960 suvs and what better way to entice them
03:06:29.200 into embracing
03:06:30.720 sustainable energy than give them the
03:06:32.319 dopest suv you can buy
03:06:34.479 yeah but that's how we justified it to
03:06:38.080 us
03:06:38.479 it's not a justification it's a great
03:06:40.640 carrot you're dangling in
03:06:42.000 an amazing carrot yeah i mean actually
03:06:44.960 in terms of
03:06:46.240 you know co2 per mile also suvs are like
03:06:49.040 among the worst you know like those very
03:06:51.439 sovs typically very low mileage take a
03:06:53.200 lot of gasoline per mile so uh you know
03:06:56.319 if
03:06:56.720 you're replacing you know big suvs
03:06:59.120 that's actually like the best thing you
03:07:00.399 could do
03:07:01.359 um on a per mile basis uh but still we
03:07:04.479 we really got carried away you know
03:07:07.840 the fabric of cars uh nobody's ever
03:07:10.399 gonna make a car like that
03:07:12.080 uh explain to me what the [ __ ] bill
03:07:14.960 gates was talking about when he was
03:07:16.240 saying that you can't do trucks
03:07:18.800 well what was yeah i didn't know what to
03:07:20.240 talk about why did he say that then
03:07:22.160 like why would somebody probably
03:07:23.439 somebody told him that and you know he
03:07:25.680 just repeated it he's just not that
03:07:27.040 close to the physics of it and
03:07:28.880 so it was because he's still intentioned
03:07:31.040 here he just doesn't know what he's
03:07:32.000 talking about
03:07:32.640 but why say it then you think about a
03:07:35.120 guy who's so
03:07:35.920 involved in technology you would think
03:07:37.439 you would only talk about things you
03:07:38.640 understand
03:07:40.160 i don't know it's weird i also heard
03:07:41.520 that at one point he had a big short
03:07:42.880 position against tesla which was kind of
03:07:44.640 i don't know if that's true or not but
03:07:45.920 it seems weird
03:07:48.560 people i know who know know the
03:07:50.000 situation well they said are you sure
03:07:52.080 they said yeah he's a big short position
03:07:53.920 against tesla which obviously didn't
03:07:55.200 work out too well
03:07:56.960 um but anyway i i think he's generally
03:08:01.040 got good intentions here i think he's
03:08:02.640 probably just not um
03:08:04.080 i don't hate bill gates to be clear i
03:08:06.080 think he just probably doesn't know
03:08:07.439 the the science yeah i just thought it
03:08:09.040 was odd because i knew that you guys
03:08:10.479 were developing yeah
03:08:11.520 semi we have prototypes that yeah that
03:08:14.240 actually drive
03:08:14.880 that actually drive like we've used them
03:08:16.319 to transport cars and stuff it's not
03:08:17.920 like
03:08:18.240 some [ __ ] it's not like a unicorn
03:08:20.160 like it was like
03:08:21.279 with pegasus or something i was like
03:08:22.720 what are you talking about we literally
03:08:24.160 have prototypes that work
03:08:25.359 what kind of mileage does those things
03:08:26.640 get uh well these are prototypes so
03:08:29.200 they'll be like
03:08:30.240 you know i don't know about 300 miles
03:08:33.040 something like that and so
03:08:34.800 we're driving back and forth from
03:08:36.880 fremont to
03:08:37.920 reno you know for transporting stuff
03:08:41.120 but generally when semi-truck drivers
03:08:43.920 when
03:08:44.319 when it's a human being driving them
03:08:46.080 they drive for long periods of time far
03:08:48.000 more than 300 miles right
03:08:50.399 no actually most trucking is short range
03:08:52.720 really yeah majority oh okay
03:08:54.240 the majority like shipping things around
03:08:56.960 cities and things like that
03:08:58.160 yeah it'll be like take stuff from the
03:08:59.680 port to the straight straightforwarding
03:09:01.600 will you
03:09:02.000 have a long range like cross-continental
03:09:04.800 conversion absolutely and so it'll be
03:09:06.800 much more batteries and
03:09:10.000 yeah um the
03:09:14.080 yeah um i mean
03:09:17.279 you want something on the order of like
03:09:19.200 uh probably a 500 kilowatt hour pack
03:09:21.920 like what we have in the s and the x is
03:09:23.439 100 kilowatt hour pack
03:09:25.200 um and yeah i probably want like i don't
03:09:27.840 know 500 kilowatt hour pack for a semi
03:09:31.520 but this is not a game changer on the
03:09:33.600 mass
03:09:34.800 especially for a structural pack where
03:09:36.800 the pack itself is uh
03:09:38.880 is the structure is the primary load
03:09:40.960 carrying
03:09:42.239 element in the vehicle is it potentially
03:09:44.880 because
03:09:45.279 it's not a game it definitely works 100
03:09:48.319 no question about it would it be
03:09:50.319 possible to have
03:09:51.520 a safer semi because of this whole
03:09:54.960 yeah well we can also you have with the
03:09:58.160 x
03:09:59.120 yeah the the center of gravity would be
03:10:01.200 really low
03:10:02.640 so that would certainly help uh we can
03:10:04.720 also um
03:10:06.880 we would have motors individually
03:10:08.560 controlling the wheels
03:10:10.000 so we can just automatically and this is
03:10:12.800 part of
03:10:13.359 our semi presentation we can just the
03:10:15.439 computer will automatically prevent it
03:10:16.880 from jackknifing like you know
03:10:18.160 jackknifing on a low
03:10:19.680 traction surface is like truck driver's
03:10:21.760 worst nightmare you know
03:10:23.040 you're like some icy road icy
03:10:25.439 mountainous road
03:10:26.479 that the trailer slides slides and you
03:10:28.399 know you know where jackknife's like
03:10:29.520 that and
03:10:30.000 it could slide off the edge of the hill
03:10:31.680 and you could stop that from happening
03:10:33.120 even on an icy road
03:10:34.239 yeah wow so because you have individual
03:10:38.399 control over over each of the wheels so
03:10:40.880 you can like you can just make sure
03:10:42.319 it's it's stable and doesn't attract
03:10:44.560 knife
03:10:45.359 um you know whereas if you've got just
03:10:47.120 one engine it's very difficult to do
03:10:48.880 that
03:10:49.840 so do you anticipate that eventually
03:10:52.319 these things would be completely
03:10:53.359 autonomous like some like
03:10:54.800 there won't be truck drivers eventually
03:10:56.880 it will be autonomous but
03:10:58.239 we're still a ways away from that um
03:11:01.359 but in the in the uh in the short term i
03:11:03.520 think we can certainly see
03:11:04.479 convoys so you know we've got uh
03:11:07.520 one truck driver and then there's like a
03:11:09.760 whole bunch of trucks following that
03:11:11.279 truck
03:11:11.920 and you know keeping like a distance so
03:11:13.840 that other cars can pass in between them
03:11:16.640 um it's sort of like having a train but
03:11:19.520 on the highway
03:11:20.800 it's like like it like linked where it's
03:11:23.200 just like one
03:11:23.920 like you got one you know truck driver
03:11:26.720 in the front and then a whole series of
03:11:28.160 trucks behind it that are following in a
03:11:29.600 convoy
03:11:30.560 whoa but the trucks behind it are
03:11:32.479 autonomous and how much space in between
03:11:34.080 you get like wheels so probably you
03:11:36.000 could put like you know
03:11:36.960 40 50 feet between them no problem oh
03:11:39.120 wow yeah and those trucks will just
03:11:40.720 follow the lead and it's just like
03:11:42.479 it's like having trains on the road and
03:11:44.479 they'll be following
03:11:45.680 through like just they know where the
03:11:47.600 trucks ahead of them are
03:11:48.960 at all times it's very easy to do a
03:11:50.560 follow
03:11:52.080 oh you say follow this thing no problem
03:11:55.359 what's next after this
03:11:58.800 um
03:12:01.840 you mean after what products or
03:12:03.520 something or yeah like
03:12:05.279 what ultimately do you think that you
03:12:07.120 could have planes
03:12:10.160 i thought about plants for a long time
03:12:16.399 but my brain will explode if i do planes
03:12:20.319 literally it's just like this is too
03:12:22.560 crazy man
03:12:24.080 it's my my brain is overloaded
03:12:27.359 so um
03:12:30.960 overloaded because of the complexity
03:12:35.600 right yeah um i'm glad there's a limit
03:12:39.760 i'm glad you got a spot where you can't
03:12:41.680 go any further
03:12:43.120 um there's only so many hours in the day
03:12:45.680 yeah
03:12:46.720 so i mean i think there's
03:12:50.000 there there are improvements happening
03:12:51.840 over time for the
03:12:53.279 uh energy density of batteries like
03:12:56.560 what hours per or should really be
03:12:59.359 joules but
03:13:00.160 like like joules per kilogram joules per
03:13:02.319 liter
03:13:03.279 um it's it's improving a little bit
03:13:06.479 every year
03:13:07.200 you know so uh planes really need a high
03:13:10.560 energy density
03:13:11.680 because you gotta get up to altitude um
03:13:15.200 like most energy is getting up to
03:13:16.560 altitude and then once you're in the
03:13:18.160 lower dense
03:13:18.960 low air density situation you can cruise
03:13:22.080 along
03:13:22.960 with fair it takes very little energy to
03:13:25.040 once you're increased
03:13:26.399 that's a massive amount of energy you
03:13:27.920 get up there so
03:13:31.520 um man i thought about this a lot
03:13:40.840 um
03:13:43.439 yeah i mean an aircraft increases a
03:13:46.319 neutral force balance so it's like it's
03:13:48.080 not accelerating
03:13:49.279 so basically if you've got an um you
03:13:51.200 know a a motor of a given
03:13:53.200 uh force the then like for for a given
03:13:56.399 force you will just go faster
03:13:58.399 as you go higher so you've got the air
03:14:01.359 resistance
03:14:02.319 the air resistance is dropping
03:14:03.520 exponentially as you go higher
03:14:05.359 if you have a constant accelerating a
03:14:08.080 constant force
03:14:09.600 from your you know motor and
03:14:13.439 propeller or turbine or whatever then
03:14:16.560 you will
03:14:16.960 just go faster the higher you go the
03:14:18.720 faster you go for the same amount of
03:14:21.279 power so so the key would be achieving a
03:14:24.239 high
03:14:24.800 altitude uh yeah it's all about altitude
03:14:28.640 like the air is very thick at at sea
03:14:31.279 level
03:14:32.319 um like for the same amount of force
03:14:35.279 that would
03:14:35.760 you would get go say like you know
03:14:38.880 uh half the speed of sound at sea level
03:14:41.920 you could go you know twice the speed of
03:14:44.960 sound at like let's say at 100
03:14:46.560 000 feet same amount of
03:14:49.680 same amount of energy in cruise is it is
03:14:52.160 that i'm just
03:14:52.880 like fly a commercial plane at 100 000
03:14:54.800 feet would that be possible
03:14:56.000 oh yeah yeah you just go fast the great
03:14:58.319 thing about that is you could bring flat
03:14:59.920 earthers up there
03:15:02.720 um yeah the the faster you go
03:15:06.880 the like you just want to go the higher
03:15:08.960 you go the faster you want to go right
03:15:10.880 um so um
03:15:14.479 like you're thinking about like the
03:15:15.680 sr-71 is that it's
03:15:18.160 it's uh it's most fuel efficient speed
03:15:20.319 was its fastest speed pretty much or
03:15:22.239 pretty you know pretty close
03:15:23.760 um because that's when it could go at
03:15:26.080 the highest altitude
03:15:27.920 so because it could go faster at higher
03:15:31.120 altitude it
03:15:31.840 it got better miles per gallon
03:15:35.279 at high speed than low speed that's
03:15:37.760 pretty wild
03:15:38.640 yeah so altitude because air density
03:15:41.520 decays exponentially
03:15:42.880 and drag increases with the square and
03:15:45.680 so
03:15:46.399 the exponential beats the square do you
03:15:48.880 think there would ever be a time where
03:15:50.399 tesla could run itself
03:15:52.000 in a sense of like you have enough
03:15:53.520 talented people running it and you
03:15:54.800 wouldn't have to devote all your
03:15:55.840 resources to
03:15:57.200 to being there all the time and handling
03:15:59.520 things and
03:16:00.319 maybe you would think about planes
03:16:05.359 yeah i mean i i'm committed to run tesla
03:16:08.640 for
03:16:10.000 you know several years into the future
03:16:12.080 um and there's
03:16:13.279 still a lot of things we got to get done
03:16:15.439 um could tesla possibly expand the
03:16:17.760 planes
03:16:20.239 it could i it is a different regime i
03:16:23.439 mean there are
03:16:24.160 there are no car companies that are
03:16:25.760 there are aircraft companies really
03:16:27.520 so um
03:16:33.760 but i think that i think there is a way
03:16:36.080 ultimately
03:16:37.040 to have a vertical tape vertical
03:16:39.600 takeover landing
03:16:41.520 supersonic electric jet wow
03:16:45.120 that would be cool but what about the
03:16:48.080 weight
03:16:49.680 that's where it comes energy density of
03:16:52.239 the of the pack is important
03:16:55.120 um you need to get high quickly yeah
03:16:58.479 good eye get high fast um
03:17:10.840 so um and you can get rid of most of the
03:17:14.000 things that are on a plane
03:17:16.160 um if you just if you if you gimble the
03:17:19.520 uh
03:17:21.279 the fan you have the fan change
03:17:23.760 direction like you do with a rocket
03:17:26.080 you know you don't need like uh your
03:17:29.120 rudder
03:17:29.680 and uh you mostly don't need an elevator
03:17:32.479 you just need like some trim tabs
03:17:35.040 so you basically have a flying wing
03:17:38.160 pretty pretty easy to do a flying wing
03:17:40.239 wow um
03:17:42.479 or you know flying wing with a little
03:17:44.880 bit of fuselage
03:17:46.800 um so you make it lighter make the pack
03:17:49.920 structural
03:17:50.960 as well so the pack is though is the
03:17:53.439 wing
03:17:56.560 yeah you got to basically put pull a few
03:17:58.319 tricks like that this is all about like
03:18:00.960 how do you make the non-cell portion of
03:18:04.319 the
03:18:04.640 of the aircraft as light as possible um
03:18:09.200 anyway this is like there's like a lot
03:18:11.359 of regulatory things you have to go
03:18:12.640 through and
03:18:13.760 um and this is counting on a
03:18:17.680 what else per kilogram
03:18:21.040 you'd want white house program at the
03:18:22.800 pack level to be
03:18:24.960 over 400
03:18:28.160 yeah so we're pretty close to that so
03:18:30.479 it's like it's
03:18:31.520 you know at the pack level not at the
03:18:34.640 cell level
03:18:36.080 but at the pac level and with high cycle
03:18:38.479 life
03:18:41.760 well listen you're doing plenty you
03:18:44.160 don't you don't necessarily have to get
03:18:45.439 into planes right now
03:18:47.439 yeah i think you're busy enough planes
03:18:50.560 will be the
03:18:51.359 the last of the things cars and trucks
03:18:54.960 and then
03:18:56.560 you know boats and then planes well it's
03:18:59.359 interesting because
03:19:00.080 plane technology in terms of like
03:19:01.520 commercial air travel is probably
03:19:04.239 increased at least visibly to the
03:19:07.040 consumer the least
03:19:08.800 in the last like 30 40 50 years it's not
03:19:11.840 much difference
03:19:12.560 the experience yeah pretty similar yep
03:19:15.680 in fact it's got slower
03:19:17.680 so right after the concord not even the
03:19:20.000 concord like the
03:19:20.800 747 was the fastest plane oh really
03:19:23.840 yeah i had a uh
03:19:26.880 swept wings like those of the wing sweep
03:19:28.800 like what's the wing angle
03:19:30.239 that's a big factor in like what it's
03:19:32.080 cruise speed is gonna be
03:19:33.760 so the 747 had a you know pretty
03:19:37.600 steep wing uh but it's it's fuel
03:19:40.640 efficiency is not as good as um
03:19:44.080 something like uh you know triple seven
03:19:46.239 or seven eight seven
03:19:48.239 um i mean there's some some like basic
03:19:51.200 things in physics that
03:19:52.720 that uh are present
03:19:55.840 almost everywhere they sometimes take
03:19:57.520 different form but they're
03:19:59.439 basically referring to the relationship
03:20:02.080 between momentum and kinetic energy
03:20:04.239 kinetic energy goes as the square of
03:20:05.840 momentum is linear
03:20:07.520 and then there's surface to volume ratio
03:20:10.080 surface volume ratio
03:20:12.080 and the momentum to kinetic energy
03:20:15.680 ratio uh drives so
03:20:19.200 much of of of
03:20:22.319 the mechanics that's insane um it's like
03:20:25.200 the reason that you don't have like a
03:20:26.880 single cell creature that
03:20:28.000 is gigantic is because of surface volume
03:20:30.319 surface volume ratio
03:20:32.080 like there's a certain surface volume
03:20:34.239 ratio where diffusion works
03:20:35.920 and beyond that diffusion does not work
03:20:38.239 and you have to have a circulatory
03:20:39.600 system
03:20:41.359 um for
03:20:44.399 for aircraft or just generally you want
03:20:46.319 to move um
03:20:47.840 a large mass of air slowly um
03:20:51.040 so you can reduce the the velocity
03:20:53.840 component of kinetic energy which right
03:20:55.520 which grows as the square
03:20:57.120 you want to move a large amount of mass
03:20:58.479 slowly not a small amount of mass fast
03:21:01.840 so the way you make aircraft engines
03:21:04.399 more efficient is you move
03:21:05.520 a lot of air slowly like big fans
03:21:08.720 basically big slow fans work great small
03:21:12.399 tiny fast-moving jets are very
03:21:14.560 inefficient
03:21:16.080 so like the you know something like
03:21:19.279 triple seven
03:21:20.399 it's really just a propeller in a shroud
03:21:22.880 um so
03:21:26.399 um high bypass was called
03:21:29.760 bypass ratio like how much of it is jet
03:21:32.479 versus propeller you want
03:21:34.319 it to be mostly propeller so this is
03:21:35.840 clearly something you've been thinking
03:21:37.040 about a lot oh sure yeah like for
03:21:41.120 13 years do you think it's going to be
03:21:43.920 the next thing for you
03:21:45.279 no i don't i hope not i hope not
03:21:51.439 there's some smart people i have to try
03:21:52.800 and tackle it in i think i hope they are
03:21:54.640 successful
03:21:56.000 um but just uh it's just right try to
03:21:59.200 get high
03:22:00.160 get high go fast get high you will
03:22:02.640 automatically go fast as you get
03:22:04.399 as you go higher it's just air density
03:22:07.600 is dropping exponentially
03:22:09.040 and you think like in the limit you've
03:22:10.319 got like a satellite satellites going
03:22:12.319 around the earth
03:22:13.040 you know low earth over satellites going
03:22:14.319 around the 25 times the speed of sound
03:22:17.439 no propulsion
03:22:21.200 so if you get high enough you just keep
03:22:24.080 going
03:22:25.120 um obviously you just want to go super
03:22:27.120 high
03:22:28.960 higher the better now the thing like you
03:22:30.720 said well why don't planes do that
03:22:31.920 already well
03:22:34.720 so if you've got a combustion engine
03:22:37.040 it's got an aperture issue
03:22:38.880 so you're like okay how big is the hole
03:22:41.200 in which you're ingesting air
03:22:43.200 and then bear in mind air is mostly
03:22:45.200 nitrogen not oxygen
03:22:47.040 so you got a lot more chaff than you got
03:22:49.680 wheat
03:22:50.720 um and that's why you know it's like
03:22:53.279 you're going to design
03:22:54.960 and this thing's got to work at sea
03:22:56.560 level it's going to work at altitude
03:22:59.520 and then it's going to drop off in
03:23:00.960 efficiency quite a lot as you go higher
03:23:03.439 um otherwise and then there's also like
03:23:05.840 well if the error
03:23:06.880 there's some other issues relating to
03:23:08.399 depressurization like how fast can you
03:23:10.319 descend
03:23:11.520 but you really just want to go super
03:23:14.160 high
03:23:16.640 and it's very difficult to de design a
03:23:19.200 combustion engine
03:23:20.640 that is effective at a wide range of
03:23:23.200 altitudes
03:23:25.200 so like the the air density at a hundred
03:23:27.680 thousand feet is approximately one
03:23:29.120 percent that at sea level
03:23:31.279 so how the hell do you design a
03:23:34.160 combustion a
03:23:35.439 like an air burning that's like an air
03:23:37.520 an air there's something that's taking
03:23:38.720 an air of combining with fuel and
03:23:40.000 burning
03:23:40.800 to work when you have a hundred fold
03:23:43.200 difference in air density
03:23:45.520 this is like this is an intractable
03:23:48.000 problem
03:23:49.359 but if you have an electric fan it's not
03:23:51.760 burning anything
03:23:52.800 so aperture doesn't matter
03:23:56.000 it's a big deal it seems like it would
03:23:58.080 be the best way to fly
03:23:59.600 yeah someone can figure out how to do it
03:24:03.600 um we're like well over three hours in
03:24:06.479 here
03:24:06.880 oh wow amazing time flies when you're
03:24:08.960 here yeah wasted
03:24:12.000 well thank you very much as always it's
03:24:13.840 a pleasure always fun to talk to you man
03:24:15.600 i really appreciate it alright welcome
03:24:17.439 um if you ever want to talk about
03:24:19.279 something i'm here for you
03:24:22.080 thanks all right thank you all right bye
