00:00:56.589 remarkable  time. We've all 
00:00:58.090 had together. He  doesn't 
00:01:00.292 need  much  of  an  
00:01:00.860 introduction  by  which 
00:01:01.694 want to say a couple  things. 
00:01:03.496 He's  the richest person  
00:01:04.462 in the world. He very well  
00:01:05.598 be  the most  concise 
00:01:08.801 how most  consequential 
00:01:10.503 individual  in the  world 
00:01:11.204 right the world in  
00:01:11.671 individual  
00:01:12.005 most consequential  console 
00:01:12.605 right now.  He runs the most  
00:01:13.539 Innovative  companies.  
00:01:17.143 World Tesla SpaceX  
00:01:17.610 starlink, which is  part of 
00:01:18.211 that  neuro-link the  boring  
00:01:18.845 company X and his x.a.  I and 
00:01:23.649 he's  disrupted each  
00:01:24.350 of these  Lanes.  He's  moved 
00:01:26.652 at  Breakneck Breakneck 
00:01:27.853 speeds, but he's  
00:01:30.056 facing a storm of controversy 
00:01:30.690 in the  process.  He  joins 
00:01:32.358 us  today following a visit 
00:01:33.593 as  you all know, so  well  
00:01:34.460 we  discussed earlier on  
00:01:36.662 Monday  to  Israel  where he  
00:01:37.864 met with  the Prime Minister  
00:01:39.298 there and the 
00:01:40.566 president of Israel and we're 
00:01:41.467 going to  talk  about 
00:01:42.101 everything  and my  hope is 
00:01:42.902 that  we can  talk  
00:01:44.470 about how he  he thinks about 
00:01:48.241 He thinks his influence about 
00:01:48.875 he thinks his power about 
00:01:49.442 He thinks all of it.  
00:01:50.042 And we're going to  talk  
00:01:50.609 about Innovation  and 
00:01:51.544 everything  else. I 
00:01:52.845 want to say just  
00:01:54.247 two other things real quick.  
00:01:54.947 So  we  met each other  
00:01:56.282 for the first time  16  years 
00:01:58.517 ago.  Yes,  long time 
00:01:59.986 a long time and all the kids  
00:02:02.255 were  three when  we  first 
00:02:05.190 met I do. I think I do  
00:02:07.527 you're  just  you're  about 
00:02:08.961 to  deliver your  first 
00:02:10.062 Roadster. I don't think you 
00:02:10.797 had yet.  Larry Page  was 
00:02:11.998 still waiting.  Yeah. 
00:02:13.466 It's to get like  in  2007  
00:02:15.534 2008  and I don't agree with  
00:02:18.204 a little bit  2008. I 
00:02:19.405 remember  going back  to  The 
00:02:20.506 Newsroom  and saying  I think 
00:02:22.108 I just  met the next  
00:02:23.876 Steve Jobs  and it was  
00:02:26.879 I'm at a  hold  to that.  
00:02:27.780 Okay, I'm gonna hold  to that 
00:02:29.782 but a lot has happened  
00:02:31.417 between when I  first met you 
00:02:34.220 and now you came  to  deal  
00:02:36.255 with  been boring,  that's  
00:02:37.156 for sure. Well, actually  it  
00:02:38.858 taken by a  
00:02:39.225 driver boring Kony  
00:02:40.993 driver boring kony2012. You 
00:02:42.595 came. To  deal  book  and 
00:02:46.432 sat on  this  stage and we're 
00:02:47.066 thrilled  to have you back  
00:02:47.833 but there's been  so  much  
00:02:49.135 that  happens between now and 
00:02:50.569 then  and there's been  
00:02:51.103 so much that's  
00:02:51.637 happened in the past  week  
00:02:52.872 week and a half and a lot of  
00:02:54.707 folks and I want to tell  you 
00:02:55.908 this  elevator. A lot of  
00:02:57.476 folks called  me  up  
00:02:58.578 and said  you really you  
00:02:59.712 really  going to  host  Elon  
00:03:00.579 Musk  here. Can you believe 
00:03:02.214 what  he  just said on  
00:03:03.449 Twitter on  1X  on? Yeah, 
00:03:06.419 Yeah. Yeah, no idea what  
00:03:08.187 this  Twitter thing 
00:03:10.656 about. Should you platform? 
00:03:12.725 Him,  that's  what they said. 
00:03:14.226 Yeah, did you platform  then? 
00:03:15.427 I said  that  I think it's  
00:03:18.431 our role. And I know  you 
00:03:19.666 have  issues  with  
00:03:20.766 Journal has a platform  
00:03:22.835 and I know you  have  
00:03:23.335 an issue  with journalists  
00:03:24.370 often times,  but I said  
00:03:25.671 it's  our role  to  have  
00:03:28.341 conversations and to  inquire 
00:03:30.476 and to  and sometimes even  
00:03:33.579 interrogate ideas and that's  
00:03:35.915 what I'm hoping.  We can  do  
00:03:36.816 that. So  I want to start 
00:03:38.017 just  so  we  can begin this  
00:03:39.418 conversation  and just  level 
00:03:43.255 just  and conversation  this  
00:03:43.889 begin can we  so  just  start 
00:03:44.523 to  I want  
00:03:44.857 level said take us through. 
00:03:48.561 Everything  that happened 
00:03:49.128 if you could  everything  
00:03:49.695 know over the past  week  
00:03:50.263 and a half  of  your God  
00:03:50.830 we're going to  we've got the 
00:03:51.464 time, okay. You send out  
00:03:53.766 a you send out  a post  or  
00:03:56.135 an  X or a  tweet,  
00:03:57.536 otherwise,  whatever. Yeah, 
00:03:58.304 as  I'm trying to like  
00:04:02.141 when things were  just  140 
00:04:03.075 characters  that made sense 
00:04:04.143 coma tweet  because 
00:04:05.444 like a bunch of little  birds 
00:04:06.145 chirping, but when  you know  
00:04:07.346 point which you can put like  
00:04:08.447 three our videos  on  
00:04:09.582 it's like it's  very  long  
00:04:10.950 tweet.  So  here  we are. 
00:04:13.085 This is more  descriptive I 
00:04:14.387 think and at  some  point 
00:04:15.588 I don't know  where you were. 
00:04:18.824 But you write in  responding  
00:04:20.259 to  another tweet.  Yes.  
00:04:23.963 This  is  the actual  truth 
00:04:25.364 and it set off  a firestorm 
00:04:28.267 of  criticism all the way to  
00:04:30.069 the White House,  right?  And 
00:04:32.705 then  you make  this  trip  
00:04:34.340 to  Israel. You have  
00:04:35.341 advertisers who left  the 
00:04:35.975 platform  people  calling.  
00:04:37.643 Well, the trip to Israel  is  
00:04:39.678 independent of  it wasn't 
00:04:41.147 something like  apology tour. 
00:04:43.516 I want to be clear. That  was 
00:04:45.418 well. Let's talk  about that. 
00:04:46.052 So  just  but 
00:04:47.453 just take this back.  Back  
00:04:48.054 to the  moment  at which  you 
00:04:49.054 write that  trip  
00:04:50.856 to Israel is independent of 
00:04:51.457 was like  in  response  
00:04:52.224 to that at all. Well, let's 
00:04:53.759 do it will do is really just  
00:04:54.760 a moment. I have  no  problem 
00:04:56.128 being hated hated,  hated 
00:04:56.896 by the  way.  I hear  it  
00:04:59.398 away. Well, but you know  
00:05:02.735 what, let's go  straight to 
00:05:04.303 that  then  for a second  
00:05:05.337 sure  because there is  an  
00:05:06.739 idea  and you could say that  
00:05:10.810 you don't real weakness 21  
00:05:17.917 He  liked a real weakness.  
00:05:18.518 I do not  have  that. Let me  
00:05:19.152 ask you this. Then. There's a 
00:05:19.786 difference  
00:05:20.119 you're saying I don't care  
00:05:20.720 if  anyone  likes me  or  
00:05:21.287 they hate me, but given your  
00:05:22.955 power and given what  you 
00:05:24.156 have  amassed and your the  
00:05:26.425 importance you  have. I would 
00:05:28.861 think you want to be  trusted 
00:05:31.130 I would think maybe you don't 
00:05:32.932 need  to be liked or  hate  
00:05:34.567 it  but trusted matters if  
00:05:37.069 if x is going to  become a  
00:05:37.770 financial platform  where 
00:05:38.637 people  going to  put 
00:05:39.171 their money where people  
00:05:40.873 where the 
00:05:41.273 government's going to 
00:05:41.773 give you  money for 
00:05:43.809 four Rockets  where people  
00:05:45.144 are going to  get into the  
00:05:45.811 cars. They  need  to  
00:05:46.812 ultimately  decide  that  
00:05:49.014 you are they  don't have  
00:05:50.216 to say  that  they love you,  
00:05:52.117 but that you  are ultimately  
00:05:53.619 a decent  and good  human 
00:05:55.221 being.  Yes.  being.  human 
00:05:56.422 good  and decent  a 
00:05:56.889 ultimately  you are that  but 
00:05:57.523 Yes.  I am and I  think I am. 
00:06:01.260 But but I'm certainly not 
00:06:01.827 going to  But do  but some  
00:06:02.428 sort of tap dance to  prove 
00:06:03.229 to people that  I am  so  as  
00:06:06.832 for trust,  I mean, I think 
00:06:08.000 write that  down  in a few  
00:06:08.634 ways  if  you want  your  
00:06:10.202 if you want satellites  
00:06:11.704 into orbit  reliably  SpaceX  
00:06:13.338 will  do  80% of  all master  
00:06:14.907 orbit this  year  China will  
00:06:15.908 be  12  percent.  The rest  
00:06:17.042 of  the world will do eight 
00:06:19.311 that includes Boeing  
00:06:19.811 Lockheed  and everyone  else. 
00:06:21.714 So  the track record  of  the 
00:06:24.149 rocket  is  the best  by far  
00:06:26.552 of  anything  you 
00:06:28.354 could you could hey My  guts  
00:06:33.559 next  you could not 
00:06:34.026 trust me. It  is relevant the 
00:06:34.660 rocket  
00:06:34.927 track record speaks for 
00:06:35.461 itself  with  respect to  
00:06:36.028 Tesla.  We  make the  best  
00:06:36.896 cars  whether you height  
00:06:39.098 your  life  hate  me  like  
00:06:40.900 me  or  
00:06:42.401 in different different. 
00:06:42.935 Do you  want  the best  car 
00:06:43.903 or  do you  not want  the 
00:06:45.104 best car  so  So  I will  
00:06:50.910 certainly not Pander  and 
00:06:53.212 Johnson like  the only  
00:06:54.013 reason  I'm here  is  because 
00:06:55.447 you are a friend. Like  what  
00:06:58.117 was my  speaking  fee?  You 
00:07:00.085 don't you're not  making  any 
00:07:01.987 example.  I'm Andrew. But 
00:07:03.889 yeah, sorry.  It's okay.  
00:07:06.325 Second  of all, 
00:07:07.259 we've known each other  
00:07:07.793 for a very long time  
00:07:08.460 smoking.  Yes,  and listen, 
00:07:14.900 you know  what? I'm trying to 
00:07:20.072 illustrate  us that sometimes 
00:07:21.607 I say the wrong thing.  I 
00:07:25.311 think they're a lot of  
00:07:25.878 people  who are tired,  but 
00:07:27.313 let me  let me  go  back. 
00:07:31.717 You should  hear  the 
00:07:32.351 sketches  that  SNL 
00:07:33.786 wooden post.  By  the way,  
00:07:34.387 those are really good by  
00:07:37.456 wooden post and I would say 
00:07:38.056 By  wooden post.  
00:07:38.490 unfortunately or  fortunately 
00:07:39.559 or unfortunately  whatever  
00:07:40.559 friendship  we  have  not 
00:07:41.527 great.  We  don't talk  to  
00:07:42.128 each other  that  that  much  
00:07:43.562 but let me  ask you this. 
00:07:45.731 That's true.  Where am I? 
00:07:48.334 Where am I  
00:07:53.906 because I need any validation 
00:07:54.540 or  it  is  that  It  it  
00:07:57.276 we've been  friends for 16  
00:07:57.977 years It  and I 
00:08:00.746 promised you I'd be here  and 
00:08:01.380 that's  why I'm here. Well, I 
00:08:02.214 appreciate  you being here  
00:08:03.482 for any other reason but  
00:08:04.049 let me  ask you this. Then. 
00:08:04.984 Let's just  go  at it.  Just  
00:08:06.819 tell  me  what  happened  you 
00:08:08.621 write this  tweet that  says  
00:08:10.389 that this is the  actual  
00:08:11.290 truth people  read  that  
00:08:12.891 tweet.  Yes,  and they  say 
00:08:15.527 Elon  Musk  is  an  
00:08:16.495 anti-semite that  he  is. 
00:08:20.833 He's riling up  this  base  
00:08:22.401 you're hearing it from  as  
00:08:23.969 I said  the White House your  
00:08:29.008 You get from  Jewish  
00:08:29.508 groups all over 
00:08:29.909 I think Jonathan  Greenblatt  
00:08:30.543 from the  ADL is  here. 
00:08:31.077 There's lots of people who  
00:08:31.744 say this  and by the way, 
00:08:33.212 it's  not just  that  
00:08:34.712 generally the whole thing 
00:08:35.280 during the whole  I did and 
00:08:36.248 that's why  when I  ask her 
00:08:37.448 responses,  excuse me,  
00:08:38.851 I said  more  More  
00:08:40.986 responses.  Yeah, I said  
00:08:42.054 more I said more than what  
00:08:42.655 you just  
00:08:43.956 read this the other was 
00:08:44.490 absent. There is  absolutely  
00:08:45.124 more. Yes,  but I'll tell you 
00:08:47.426 the thing that  struck  me  
00:08:48.527 it  wasn't  and I'm 
00:08:50.262 an American Jew.  It  wasn't  
00:08:52.564 just  the people  who had 
00:08:54.667 that  view  was actually  
00:08:56.168 people  who who really  
00:08:58.570 are anti-semites  who said  
00:08:59.972 oh my goodness  go go E Lon 
00:09:03.375 this  is  E Lon,  fabulous. 
00:09:04.176 E Lon E Lon,  And that  
00:09:06.011 actually  was the thing that  
00:09:07.012 really  me  set really  
00:09:07.546 really  that  thing the was 
00:09:08.146 actually  that  And back. I 
00:09:09.114 said  I myself  
00:09:12.351 what's going on here  and I 
00:09:12.952 want  to  know  how you felt  
00:09:13.586 about What's going on that  
00:09:14.186 what's going on in that 
00:09:14.720 moment. When you  when  you 
00:09:15.854 saw all of this happening.  
00:09:17.623 Yeah. Well, first of all, I 
00:09:20.259 did clarify almost  
00:09:21.960 immediately what I meant, 
00:09:23.996 I would say that  that was  
00:09:25.864 you know, if I  could go  
00:09:26.465 back  and say I should  
00:09:28.901 in retrospect not have  
00:09:30.669 replied to that 
00:09:31.170 particular person and I 
00:09:32.905 should  have  written in  
00:09:36.308 Greater length  as  to  what  
00:09:37.309 I meant.  I did 
00:09:40.212 subsequently clarify. In  
00:09:43.482 replies,  but 
00:09:43.849 those clarifications  were  
00:09:44.449 ignored by  the media.  And 
00:09:46.552 essentially I had a loaded  
00:09:47.686 gun to  those who hate  me  
00:09:49.421 and arguably  to those  who 
00:09:50.723 had just medic  to  
00:09:53.158 fill in for that. I'm quite 
00:09:54.259 sorry.  That  is  not 
00:09:56.528 that was  not my  intention 
00:09:57.529 intention.  So  I that  sorry 
00:09:59.798 did,  you know  That  sorry.  
00:10:01.934 post  on  my  primary 
00:10:03.936 timeline  to  be  absolutely  
00:10:05.137 clear that  I'm not 
00:10:06.805 anti-semitic  that  and 
00:10:07.339 anti-semitic  not I'm that  
00:10:07.939 clear absolutely  be  to  and 
00:10:08.573 that  I in fact if  anything  
00:10:10.242 and file  of Summer Enoch 
00:10:12.378 and the trip to Israel  was 
00:10:12.979 planned before  any of that 
00:10:14.046 happened. It  was neither 
00:10:15.881 here  nor there.  Do you see  
00:10:18.183 this  thing?  You know  what  
00:10:19.451 it is?  I do  because I 
00:10:20.986 actually  followed  your tire 
00:10:22.454 trip  to  Israel  right when  
00:10:24.623 I tell everybody. This  is  
00:10:28.160 the says. It says bring them  
00:10:31.830 home. the hostages  it  was 
00:10:37.836 given to  me  by  the parents 
00:10:39.104 of  one of the  hostages. 
00:10:41.940 and I said  I would wear  it  
00:10:43.375 just as long  as  there was a 
00:10:44.443 hostage store meeting and I 
00:10:46.845 have  what  was that  trip  
00:10:50.549 like  and obviously,  
00:10:51.950 you know  that  there's a 
00:10:52.951 public  perception  that  and 
00:10:55.687 your clarifying this  now.  
00:10:58.056 but But 
00:10:58.690 there is a public perception  
00:10:59.324 that  that  was but part  of  
00:11:00.025 But a apology tour. If  
00:11:02.394 you will  that  this had been 
00:11:03.862 said  online  there was all 
00:11:05.664 of the  criticism there was 
00:11:07.332 advertisers leaving we  
00:11:08.200 talked  to  Bob I gotta stop  
00:11:10.669 you.  Hope  don't Hope  
00:11:11.837 gotta stop you. I Bob to  
00:11:12.404 talked  we  leaving 
00:11:12.872 was advertisers don't 
00:11:13.372 advertise.  You don't want  
00:11:13.973 them  to  have a Time know. 
00:11:15.140 What  do  you mean? If  
00:11:18.677 somebody  
00:11:19.144 could try to Blackmail  me  
00:11:19.745 with  advertising 
00:11:21.079 blackmail me with money go  
00:11:22.781 fááá  yourself. but go  fááá  
00:11:30.088 yourself. Is  that  clear?  
00:11:33.759 I hope  it  is. Hey Bob.  
00:11:36.662 You're in the audience. Well, 
00:11:38.197 let me ask you  then. That's  
00:11:41.400 how I feel. but advertise,  
00:11:44.770 how do  you But advertise,  
00:11:45.371 think that  about the 
00:11:46.271 economics of  x if  part of 
00:11:50.375 the underlying  model least 
00:11:51.710 today and maybe it  needs to  
00:11:52.978 shift.  Maybe the answer  
00:11:54.179 is it needs to  shift away  
00:11:54.780 from  advertising 
00:11:56.315 advertising?  If  you believe 
00:11:58.183 that  this is the one part  
00:11:59.384 of  your  business  where you 
00:12:00.685 will be beholding to  those 
00:12:02.154 who have  this  view. 
00:12:06.191 What do you do? Why?  I 
00:12:11.797 understand  that  there's a 
00:12:12.598 reality to  right.  
00:12:17.302 Yes, no. No,  I mean  
00:12:19.304 Ocarina is right here,  and 
00:12:19.905 Ocarina is right here she's 
00:12:20.505 got to sell advertising.  
00:12:21.206 Absolutely. So  no no,  
00:12:23.342 don't tell you  so  well, 
00:12:25.110 no, actually  what  this  
00:12:26.111 advertising boycott is  is  
00:12:28.313 going to do it's going  to  
00:12:28.981 kill  company.  And you think 
00:12:33.619 that the  and And and the 
00:12:35.487 whole world will know that  
00:12:37.823 those advertisers killed  
00:12:39.124 company and we  will  
00:12:39.725 document  it  in  
00:12:40.325 great detail. But there are 
00:12:42.494 those advertisers I imagine 
00:12:43.896 are going to  say 
00:12:44.930 they're going to  say we  
00:12:45.498 didn't  kill  the company.  
00:12:46.398 Oh, yeah, they can  you say 
00:12:48.800 hello to tell to Earth, 
00:12:49.334 hello to tell to Earth  but 
00:12:49.934 they're going to  say that  
00:12:50.535 hello to tell to Earth, 
00:12:51.069 they're going to  say you 
00:12:51.670 hello to tell to Earth  
00:12:52.203 Lon that you  killed  the 
00:12:52.771 company because you said  
00:12:53.338 these things  and they  were  
00:12:55.908 inappropriate things  and 
00:12:57.409 they  didn't  feel  
00:12:58.043 comfortable on the  platform, 
00:12:59.244 right?  platform, the 
00:13:00.279 comfortable on  feel  didn't  
00:13:00.913 they  and things  
00:13:01.346 inappropriate That's that's 
00:13:01.947 what Amanda said. Let's see 
00:13:02.547 how Earth response  to that.  
00:13:09.454 So many okay this then this 
00:13:10.055 goes  back  to  what  
00:13:10.555 we'll both make our cases,  
00:13:11.156 right and we'll see what  
00:13:11.723 the outcome is. What  are the 
00:13:12.724 economics of  that  for you?  
00:13:13.492 I mean  you have  enormous  
00:13:14.760 resources so you  can 
00:13:15.694 actually  keep this company 
00:13:16.495 going for very  long  time. 
00:13:17.796 Would you keep  it  going for 
00:13:18.730 a long  time  if  there was 
00:13:19.665 no  advertising?  I mean if 
00:13:22.334 the company fails because of  
00:13:24.336 an Advertiser boycott,  it  
00:13:25.037 will  fail  because of times  
00:13:26.705 boycott and that  will be 
00:13:28.073 what  bankrupt the company  
00:13:29.207 and that's  what  
00:13:30.442 everyone on Earth will  know. 
00:13:35.314 What  do you  think then  
00:13:35.881 of the  I can trust though? 
00:13:36.615 They're not be gone and we'll 
00:13:37.782 be  gone  because of an 
00:13:38.817 Advertiser  boycott,  but you 
00:13:41.053 recognize that  some of those 
00:13:41.853 people  are going to  say 
00:13:43.255 that  they  didn't  feel  
00:13:43.956 comfortable on the  platform  
00:13:45.791 and I want I just wonder  and 
00:13:47.526 ask you about and think about 
00:13:48.860 that  for a 
00:13:50.495 sec to adjudge with 
00:13:50.962 dollar to a judge it, but the 
00:13:51.796 judge is  going to  be  
00:13:53.298 judges  the public. And you 
00:13:56.167 think that  the public  is  
00:13:56.768 going to  say that  that  
00:13:58.670 Disney  is  making  
00:13:59.338 a mistake.  
00:14:01.907 Yeah, and they're going to  
00:14:02.508 boycott Disney  
00:14:03.174 yeah, and they're going 
00:14:03.775 Yeah, and they're going 
00:14:04.309 yeah, and they're going 
00:14:04.843 they already are  well, there 
00:14:06.211 are some  that are  
00:14:07.946 for lots of different 
00:14:08.446 reasons,  but you think that  
00:14:09.247 this  is  going to  that  you 
00:14:11.583 have  the this  
00:14:12.617 ghost actually  the 
00:14:13.084 interesting of  power 
00:14:14.419 of power and  leverage  let 
00:14:15.821 the chips fall  where they  
00:14:16.755 may 
00:14:22.127 Let the chips fall where they 
00:14:22.761 may I just want y that is the 
00:14:23.395 approach. I asked it because  
00:14:24.296 you've been 
00:14:25.430 with every approach.  Well, 
00:14:26.031 you've been very  particular  
00:14:26.932 about the approach to Tesla 
00:14:29.801 when you think about  the 
00:14:30.635 engineering involved  in that 
00:14:31.269 the approach  to  SpaceX  the 
00:14:33.338 approach  to  some  of the  
00:14:34.773 stuff you're doing  with  
00:14:35.941 with  AI has  been  very  
00:14:38.143 specific  right?  There's not 
00:14:40.045 a let the chips fall  
00:14:41.246 where they  may approach  to  
00:14:42.347 those businesses. I 
00:14:44.049 don't think that  we focus on 
00:14:45.050 making  the best  products  
00:14:46.451 and products  best  the 
00:14:46.985 focus on making we  
00:14:47.452 think that  don't I and Tesla 
00:14:48.086 has gotten  
00:14:48.620 to where it's gotten. With  
00:14:51.623 no  advertising at all. I 
00:14:52.190 understand  that  Tesla 
00:14:53.025 currently sells to  
00:14:55.427 twice as much in terms  of  
00:14:57.429 electric  vehicles  as  
00:14:59.031 rest of electric  car makers  
00:15:00.565 and United States combined  
00:15:03.535 tell has done more to help  
00:15:04.169 the environment than  all 
00:15:06.872 other companies combined  
00:15:09.875 refer to  say that  therefore 
00:15:11.276 as  a leader  of  
00:15:12.010 the company.  I've done more  
00:15:12.911 for the environment than  
00:15:14.012 everyone  else  at any  
00:15:14.913 single  human on  earth.  
00:15:17.449 How do you  feel  about that? 
00:15:19.017 Now 
00:15:20.952 what are still about that?  
00:15:21.553 Yeah. No, I'm asking  you 
00:15:22.754 personally  how you feel  
00:15:23.355 about that  because this goes 
00:15:24.223 we're talking about power and 
00:15:25.257 influence and I'm saying  
00:15:26.691 I'm saying  what  I care  
00:15:27.725 about is  the reality of  
00:15:29.494 goodness  not the perception  
00:15:30.562 of  it  and what  I see all 
00:15:33.765 of the place is people who  
00:15:34.366 care  about looking good  
00:15:36.101 while doing evil  fááá  them. 
00:15:43.175 Okay. Let me ask  you this  
00:15:43.776 because I think part  of  
00:15:44.343 let me ask  this  Let me ask  
00:15:44.977 by the way, there's some  
00:15:45.544 people who  said  look  
00:15:46.978 owning  X to  begin with  as  
00:15:48.346 just  created problems  that  
00:15:49.481 you created so  many  amazing 
00:15:51.249 things  that  are changing  
00:15:52.184 our world and and I know  you 
00:15:55.353 want to make  X at this And 
00:15:57.289 world.  fabulous  
00:15:59.157 Town Square Free  Speech  
00:16:00.258 platform, but that  
00:16:02.494 unto itself that that has 
00:16:03.528 create such a distraction of  
00:16:04.462 all of  these things. This  
00:16:05.463 is  the conversation  
00:16:06.298 we're having  we're not 
00:16:07.799 focus.  We're not talking 
00:16:08.567 lease yet and we  will  
00:16:09.901 on Tesla  you have  your  
00:16:10.602 cyber truck deliveries. 
00:16:13.705 Tomorrow  and everything  
00:16:14.272 else  you're doing  but 
00:16:14.806 is there any  will be the 
00:16:15.373 biggest product launch  of  
00:16:16.274 anything  but by far on Earth 
00:16:18.376 this year is  
00:16:19.878 it is there any part of you 
00:16:20.479 though? That  just  says  
00:16:21.580 you know  what  I just  
00:16:23.181 shouldn't have  done  this  
00:16:23.782 or  maybe I should  sell  it  
00:16:24.916 or give it  away  or  do  
00:16:25.917 something else  with  that  
00:16:28.019 with  the X piece of  it. 
00:16:29.521 Yeah, given given given the 
00:16:31.423 propensity  for some of the 
00:16:33.625 things  that  you do  and 
00:16:34.860 say on that platform  
00:16:36.294 to create these these issues. 
00:16:40.065 Yeah. I will  
00:16:47.339 the posts I've done on the  
00:16:47.973 platform. I think 
00:16:49.541 there might be. 30,000  or  
00:16:52.377 something like  that  right 
00:16:53.845 once  in awhile.  I'll say  
00:16:56.548 something foolish.  And I 
00:16:59.651 have  and I would certainly 
00:17:01.753 it  put and And that  comment 
00:17:02.821 and that  you said  there's 
00:17:05.057 truth in  among perhaps 
00:17:07.492 one of  the most  
00:17:08.393 foolish if not  the most  
00:17:08.960 foolish thing I've ever done  
00:17:09.761 on the  platform  and I did 
00:17:13.298 do  my  best  to  clarify 
00:17:15.867 afterwards  that  you know, I 
00:17:19.604 certainly don't mean  
00:17:20.305 anything  anti-semitic  in  
00:17:21.373 that  the nature of the 
00:17:23.974 criticism was simply  that  
00:17:25.109 the that  simply  was 
00:17:25.609 criticism of the  nature  the 
00:17:26.243 that  in  the Jewish people 
00:17:26.978 have  been  persecuted  for 
00:17:29.047 thousands of  years.  Ears. 
00:17:30.349 There is  a natural Affinity  
00:17:31.983 therefore for persecuted  
00:17:34.386 groups. This  has led to  the 
00:17:37.856 funding of  organizations.  
00:17:39.291 organizations that  
00:17:43.295 is essentially  promote any 
00:17:44.796 persecuted  group or  any 
00:17:45.630 group with  the perception of 
00:17:47.032 persecution.  This  includes  
00:17:49.000 radical Islamic groups. 
00:17:51.970 Everyone  here  has seen  
00:17:53.138 everyone  the Everyone  
00:17:54.406 everyone  massive 
00:17:55.740 demonstrations  for Hamas in  
00:17:58.677 every major city  in the  
00:18:00.478 West. That  should  be  
00:18:04.282 jarring.  Well  a number  of  
00:18:08.020 those organizations received  
00:18:10.288 funding from  
00:18:11.756 prominent people  in the  
00:18:12.323 Jewish  Community.  They  
00:18:14.192 didn't  expect  that  
00:18:15.260 to happen it  but if  you 
00:18:18.196 generically But it. but it  
00:18:18.830 But it. without condition 
00:18:22.300 sort of fund  if  you find  
00:18:24.402 the persecuted  groups  in  
00:18:26.404 general Some  of those  
00:18:29.608 persecuted  groups  
00:18:31.276 unfortunately won't your  
00:18:32.611 annihilation. and And and 
00:18:34.712 what  is what I meant by  
00:18:36.014 that  And when I  
00:18:37.582 subsequently  
00:18:39.484 clarify it is is  that  
00:18:40.185 it's unwise to  to to find  
00:18:42.821 to find organizations 
00:18:43.322 unwise to it's  
00:18:43.722 clarified is is that  
00:18:44.223 organizations that  support 
00:18:45.123 groups  that  want  your  
00:18:46.625 annihilation. Is  this  
00:18:49.828 coming  across  McNeely? Yeah 
00:18:53.198 my question to you  though. 
00:18:54.532 Logically.  This  is  makes 
00:18:55.433 a lot of  sense.  
00:18:56.334 Is there any  part of you?  
00:18:57.569 Just tell me  what  
00:18:58.236 happens though? When  once  
00:18:59.638 all this  happens,  let's say 
00:19:01.206 you find a group that group 
00:19:02.707 supports  
00:19:04.409 Moss. He wants you to die.  
00:19:06.211 Perhaps you should  not fund  
00:19:07.512 them, right?  But you but 
00:19:11.816 you do  thank you but you 
00:19:12.450 But you but you you do  
00:19:14.686 appreciate  that  when  you 
00:19:16.821 wade into these very  
00:19:18.023 delicate  Waters  When  that. 
00:19:19.290 at  these when  that  When  
00:19:19.891 that. very  delicate  times.  
00:19:21.393 Yes,  Yes that it can create  
00:19:23.194 a real. I mean  as  it  
00:19:25.130 created headlines for the 
00:19:26.131 past  two weeks and and 
00:19:27.932 economic  impact. What  I'm 
00:19:32.537 just so curious what  happens 
00:19:34.039 in  your brain when you see 
00:19:35.139 all this  happening,  I think 
00:19:36.141 are you sitting there going?  
00:19:37.542 Oh my God,  I stepped in  it. 
00:19:39.144 I wish I  didn't  do  that. 
00:19:40.278 Are you saying  sááá  
00:19:41.879 through them? I hate these  
00:19:42.480 people  why they after me but 
00:19:44.149 all of that.  Yeah, 
00:19:48.153 all of that.  I mean, look, 
00:19:51.656 I'm sorry for that  that  
00:19:53.758 pre or  post. It  was foolish 
00:19:54.792 of me of the  30,000. It  
00:19:56.761 might be  literally the worst 
00:19:57.696 and worst the literally be  
00:19:58.297 might It  30,000. the me of 
00:19:58.897 foolish of  was dumbest to  
00:19:59.498 post  that  I've ever done  
00:20:01.566 and I try to  do my best  
00:20:03.268 to clarify  six 
00:20:03.735 ways to Sunday, but But 
00:20:06.371 ways to Sunday. you know, 
00:20:06.938 at least  but ways to Sunday, 
00:20:07.572 But ways to Sunday. I think 
00:20:08.173 over time it'll be  obvious 
00:20:08.973 that  in fact far from  being 
00:20:11.576 anti-semitic. I'm in  fact  
00:20:12.711 follow  Semitic and my  
00:20:14.879 all the evidence  in  my  
00:20:16.781 track record  
00:20:17.782 would support that. 
00:20:18.983 Obviously. There  are people  
00:20:20.485 who say crazy things  on  on  
00:20:22.554 X,  as  you know, maybe think 
00:20:24.456 they're crazy people are not  
00:20:27.492 they're not the crazy, but  
00:20:28.093 they're think maybe know, you 
00:20:28.727 as  X,  the aspiration  for 
00:20:29.327 X is  to be the global  town  
00:20:35.700 square. 
00:20:35.967 Now if you were to walk down  
00:20:36.601 to let's  say 
00:20:36.968 x square, right?  Do you  
00:20:38.703 occasionally  hear  people  
00:20:39.370 saying  crazy things? Yes,  
00:20:40.905 but they're not they don't  
00:20:41.706 have  the megaphone right and 
00:20:43.408 that's  that's  the conundrum 
00:20:45.343 but they can only say it  to  
00:20:46.778 50 or 100 people  that  are 
00:20:47.445 that are  sitting standing  
00:20:48.246 there in  Times Square. They  
00:20:50.181 don't have  a mega. I mean  
00:20:51.249 look  the the joke I used 
00:20:52.650 to make about old Twitter was 
00:20:53.651 it  was like  giving  
00:20:54.652 everyone  in  the psych ward  
00:20:55.854 a megaphone.  So, you know, 
00:20:59.190 you So, megaphone.  ward a  
00:20:59.791 the psych in  everyone  
00:21:00.325 giving  like  I'm aware of  
00:21:00.925 that  things can  
00:21:04.195 gets promoted that  are - 
00:21:05.263 beyond  Gets promoted the 
00:21:05.864 sort of Circle  of  somebody  
00:21:08.600 simply  gets promoted 
00:21:09.100 screaming crazy things  in  
00:21:10.402 Time Square which happens 
00:21:10.969 all the time, you know, so  
00:21:14.906 the it's  actually  it's  
00:21:18.009 pretty  rare  for something 
00:21:21.179 frankly that  is  hateful to  
00:21:23.815 be  promoted. It's not  
00:21:24.916 it's not  it's  not 
00:21:25.817 that it never happened. But 
00:21:28.019 it's  it's  fairly  rare. 
00:21:30.422 I mean, I would encourage 
00:21:31.423 people  to  look  at  
00:21:32.724 for those that  use the 
00:21:33.525 system  when you  look  at  
00:21:35.059 the the sort of the feed  
00:21:36.427 that  you receive.  How often 
00:21:39.063 is  it? Is  it  hateful and 
00:21:41.666 over  time  has it gotten 
00:21:43.468 more  or  less  hateful and I 
00:21:45.370 would say that  if  you 
00:21:46.638 look at at the  look  you if  
00:21:47.972 that  say I would and hateful 
00:21:48.606 less  or  it gotten more  the 
00:21:49.240 X5 forms  a day versus a year 
00:21:52.710 ago.  Go  I think it  is  
00:21:53.277 actually  much  better. 
00:21:53.811 I mean, what  is  your  
00:21:54.612 clothes?  Like are you  
00:21:55.146 surprised I'm just  curious 
00:21:57.015 if you  use this  I use the 
00:21:58.215 platform  religiously I 
00:22:01.586 so you  admit to being  an  
00:22:02.354 addict  you and I use the 
00:22:03.922 for you and I will  I will  
00:22:05.423 say now the problem is  
00:22:07.692 because I'm a journalist  I 
00:22:08.827 go  looking for stuff.  Well, 
00:22:10.228 that's  not a sentence saying 
00:22:12.831 because I and I also  think 
00:22:14.332 the algorithm for me  
00:22:15.366 personally  because I'm 
00:22:16.434 looking for stuff also  is  
00:22:17.669 feeding the others  things. 
00:22:19.771 This  is actually a challenge 
00:22:21.572 in that A a like  sometimes 
00:22:23.608 people  will  say like  why 
00:22:24.476 is  it  showing me, you know  
00:22:27.879 posts from  this  person  
00:22:28.813 that  I hate  and 
00:22:30.482 we're like well,  did you 
00:22:31.716 interact  a lot with  this  
00:22:32.917 person  that you  hate? Well, 
00:22:34.118 yes.  Well  therefore 
00:22:36.388 thinks that you want  to  
00:22:37.021 interact  more  with  this  
00:22:38.022 person  that you  hate. 
00:22:39.324 That's  like  a reasonable. 
00:22:41.593 Let me ask, you know, 
00:22:42.494 if you kind of  want  
00:22:43.061 to have an argument tweet.  
00:22:44.262 Yeah. Do  you have  a post? 
00:22:46.564 Let's say post  when  you 
00:22:47.899 post  it wasn't a moment. If  
00:22:49.067 anyone  can I come  up with a 
00:22:49.834 better  word? better  a 
00:22:53.138 come up with  I can anyone  
00:22:53.738 If  moment. post it wasn't a  
00:22:54.372 word? That would be great 
00:22:58.610 when you  post  though, but 
00:22:59.277 this  bad word I can think  
00:22:59.878 of  is post. So when you  
00:23:00.445 post though,  do you  are you 
00:23:01.079 trying to rile  up  either  a 
00:23:01.880 base  or  an  audience? Do  
00:23:04.148 you recognize the power 
00:23:06.117 you have  in that?  And and 
00:23:08.253 also  by  the way not just  
00:23:09.454 rile up rile up one version 
00:23:11.322 of  sorry,  but also  
00:23:12.790 write down  which is  to say  
00:23:14.492 as  I said, there are people  
00:23:15.327 who are demonstrable  
00:23:16.895 anti-semitic  on  the site  
00:23:18.496 who I get jewboy things.  All 
00:23:21.299 sorts of  things  that come 
00:23:22.333 through on my way.  
00:23:23.668 Hey for a while.  I thought I 
00:23:24.302 was through so  they would  
00:23:24.903 you know  get it  to  it. But 
00:23:26.237 no, but the question  is  
00:23:27.405 condemned as Supergirl  you 
00:23:28.006 ever  think to  yourself. 
00:23:28.740 You know  what  I'm gonna go  
00:23:29.440 online  and I'm going to  say 
00:23:30.842 these people  I condemn these 
00:23:32.911 people  that  are on  my  
00:23:33.778 site  saying  these things  
00:23:36.214 because I have said I have  
00:23:37.949 you see I've  condemned an  
00:23:39.284 assembly  but do  you ever  
00:23:39.918 go  I said  I could can 
00:23:42.020 literally I literally posted  
00:23:43.287 I condemn anti-Semitism in  
00:23:44.689 all its forms like  that is a 
00:23:46.491 literal we've literal post  
00:23:48.426 that  post  we've literal 
00:23:48.993 literal a like that is  forms 
00:23:49.627 all its in  that I made.  
00:23:53.731 I mean, I'm like  listen  if  
00:23:54.365 I can get out thesaurus if  
00:23:54.966 you you know, and we  could 
00:23:56.134 you know, I let me ask  you 
00:23:57.735 a different question  
00:24:00.138 you you you compose it. I'll  
00:24:00.838 post it.  Okay. Let me  
00:24:01.939 ask you this. You You you you 
00:24:05.443 you you you You you you 
00:24:05.977 your honor  you're  
00:24:06.444 on a podcast  about a month 
00:24:07.345 ago.  And you said  something 
00:24:09.547 that struck me  and 
00:24:11.182 it struck me  is  accurate  
00:24:12.583 came  out of  your mouth. So  
00:24:13.952 hopefully it  is  but it  I'm 
00:24:15.953 hoping  to go deep  on this 
00:24:17.288 stuff because it came out 
00:24:17.855 of my mouth 
00:24:18.556 does not mean it's  true. You 
00:24:23.661 said  my  mother  who said  
00:24:24.295 my  mind  is a storm. I don't 
00:24:24.929 think most  people  would 
00:24:25.563 want  to  be  me. They  
00:24:27.365 may think they  want  to be 
00:24:28.099 me, but they  don't know  
00:24:30.468 they don't  understand. What  
00:24:33.371 did you mean  by  that? 
00:24:34.505 What was  that  what  your  
00:24:35.907 mind  being a storm and I 
00:24:37.408 think it  I mean  I have  
00:24:39.210 known you for quite 
00:24:39.844 some time.  I think it  is  
00:24:40.611 a bit of a  storm.  Yes.  
00:24:46.417 Yeah, I mean  I Yeah. Yeah, 
00:24:47.885 know as much as a where the 
00:24:49.687 metaphor  make  sense,  
00:24:52.724 my mind is  often feels like  
00:24:54.225 a like a  like  a very  Wild  
00:24:56.427 Storm.  I mean, I have  
00:24:59.497 a fountain of ideas.  I mean  
00:25:00.164 I have  my ideas and  I could 
00:25:01.099 possibly  execute so  
00:25:03.735 I have no shortage  of  ideas 
00:25:04.769 Innovation  is  not 
00:25:05.837 the problem.  The problem 
00:25:06.771 execution is the  problem.  
00:25:08.072 I've got a million  ideas.  
00:25:08.806 I mean, I've  got an entire 
00:25:09.707 entire design an  got 
00:25:10.207 mean, I've  I 
00:25:10.574 got a million ideas.  I've  
00:25:11.175 design  for an  electric  
00:25:12.510 supersonic  vertical. Off 
00:25:14.913 jet but I mean I just if I  
00:25:15.513 just  can't do  that  as  
00:25:16.214 well. I've had  it  for 10  
00:25:17.749 years.  And there's a million 
00:25:22.553 things  your storm a Happy  
00:25:24.422 Storm.  Yeah, 
00:25:30.995 it's not a Happy  Storm.  
00:25:32.196 Yeah. tell us about that  
00:25:34.699 Tell us because I think that  
00:25:35.333 that  tell us actually  
00:25:36.267 Tell us when people try to  
00:25:37.134 really  understand  you,  I 
00:25:38.102 think that  there's a lot 
00:25:39.003 there's a that  think I you.  
00:25:39.637 understand  really  to  
00:25:40.171 people try  it when of  this  
00:25:40.805 comes from  some  other place 
00:25:41.439 and I want  to  talk  about 
00:25:42.240 that. What  do you  think 
00:25:42.841 that  is? It was  really like 
00:25:57.055 a psychiatrist catch her or 
00:25:59.657 something.  You know, I think 
00:26:07.699 to some degree  I was 
00:26:08.599 born this way,  but and then  
00:26:09.400 it  was Amplified by  a 
00:26:10.702 difficult childhood rightly.  
00:26:13.137 So  but I can remember  even  
00:26:16.541 in  the happy moments when  
00:26:17.542 I was a kid that  there's 
00:26:19.543 kid that  was a I 
00:26:19.977 happy moments when  there's 
00:26:20.578 just  it  just  feels like  
00:26:22.847 this just a rage  of  horses  
00:26:25.984 Rage  in my mind  constantly  
00:26:29.187 now this, you know  
00:26:30.822 productively  
00:26:31.522 manifests itself  in  
00:26:34.859 technology  and Building  
00:26:35.827 Things  for the most  part, 
00:26:38.863 so  And I think on  balance 
00:26:43.267 the output  has been  very  
00:26:44.869 productive. I think the 
00:26:48.239 results at  as  we  you know, 
00:26:50.441 discussed earlier with  
00:26:51.242 SpaceX  Tesla PayPal, which 
00:26:53.444 is  you know, still going 
00:26:56.147 today the first year  and a 
00:27:00.251 company that  I started in  
00:27:01.018 fact  the first In  started.  
00:27:01.986 year in a company I started 
00:27:02.587 of  to  was funded  by  
00:27:06.991 New York  Times company 
00:27:08.192 Hearst  knight-ridder and 
00:27:09.293 remember  We  wrote some  
00:27:12.363 of the  software  for we  the 
00:27:14.365 New York  Times website We  
00:27:15.633 we  and we  help  bring 
00:27:17.168 online  several hundred 
00:27:19.370 newspapers  that  previously  
00:27:20.805 were  only  in  front.  Now.  
00:27:23.107 This  is  in  the 90s,  which 
00:27:25.042 at this point is  like  
00:27:26.911 I'm like  good  grandpa 
00:27:28.412 black, but  
00:27:31.115 basically, you know the 
00:27:32.717 nineties  and internet  feels 
00:27:33.484 like  a Precambrian era when  
00:27:34.819 there were only the sponges 
00:27:38.055 so  Anyway, so, anyway, so, 
00:27:41.692 Anyway, so, you know, 
00:27:42.393 anyway, so, I feel like that  
00:27:43.027 a lot of  productive  things  
00:27:43.661 have been done  and you can 
00:27:44.262 also  look at Tesla as  being 
00:27:46.030 through as  Tesla at  look  
00:27:46.764 can also  you and been done 
00:27:47.364 have  productive things many  
00:27:47.998 companies and wine  like are  
00:27:48.833 super charging  network is  
00:27:50.234 if  it  were  if  this  
00:27:53.571 it tells  
00:27:54.539 a supercharger Network  
00:27:55.073 where its own company,  
00:27:55.607 it would be a Fortune 500 
00:27:56.174 company by  itself. It's  
00:27:58.542 just  just  the super 
00:28:00.044 charging  system. We also 
00:28:03.181 make  the cells we  build the 
00:28:07.485 electronics in the  
00:28:08.486 power train from  scratch.  
00:28:10.988 We have the most  Innovative  
00:28:12.890 structural  design. The 
00:28:14.392 larger  castings  ever  used. 
00:28:16.994 We have the best  
00:28:18.229 manufacturing technology  
00:28:18.796 have the best manufacturing 
00:28:19.397 We  used. ever  castings  
00:28:19.964 larger  technology  
00:28:20.431 at Tesla better manufacturing 
00:28:21.065 technology  than  
00:28:22.266 companies that have been doing
00:28:23.434 it. For 100 years.  So so 
00:28:24.902 these these Demons  of  the 
00:28:26.671 mind, you know, I 
00:28:30.274 for the most  part  harnessed 
00:28:32.777 to  productive  ends, it's  
00:28:35.479 Luna a script that does 
00:28:37.315 it mean that once in  a while 
00:28:37.949 while.  They  they  while 
00:28:40.918 you know, go  wrong wrong,  
00:28:44.088 wrong wrong,  but but and 
00:28:46.590 this  is  a question, I think 
00:28:47.525 a lot of  lot of people,  
00:28:48.092 think a question, I a is  
00:28:48.659 this  and wrong know, go  
00:28:49.227 people, you know  are always  
00:28:49.861 trying to figure  out about 
00:28:50.728 not just  you but sometimes 
00:28:53.264 Meaning what  is  driving all 
00:28:53.965 this  you're doing  all of  
00:28:54.866 these things. Do you  think 
00:28:56.968 it's  do you  think that  you 
00:28:58.769 would be  as  successful? 
00:29:00.705 Whatever  success is  if  it  
00:29:03.774 wasn't  being If  if  driven  
00:29:04.575 by  some  I think that  
00:29:05.710 there's something 
00:29:06.310 you're trying to  prove 
00:29:07.378 either  yourself or to  
00:29:08.379 somebody. I don't know. We're 
00:29:09.747 all trying  to  prove that  
00:29:10.715 the person who  is my 
00:29:11.315 mother. I don't know. No, 
00:29:14.819 if I  were  to  sit 
00:29:15.820 describe My Philosophy  it  
00:29:17.288 is a philosophy of  
00:29:17.989 curiosity.  I did have  this  
00:29:26.130 existential crisis  when  I 
00:29:27.098 was around  12  about 
00:29:30.768 what's the  meaning of  life, 
00:29:32.036 isn't it  all pointless?  
00:29:34.472 Why not just  commit suicide  
00:29:35.606 why exist?  I read  the 
00:29:40.278 religious texts.  I read  the 
00:29:42.813 philosophy  books that  are 
00:29:46.617 especially  the German  
00:29:47.385 philosophy  books made  me  
00:29:48.386 quite depressed frankly when  
00:29:49.787 frankly depressed quite me  
00:29:50.388 made  books philosophy  
00:29:50.922 German  the when  you're  not 
00:29:51.556 read  schopenhauer  
00:29:52.423 and each has a teenager.  But 
00:29:55.626 then  I read  but But but 
00:29:57.628 Douglas Adams 
00:29:58.629 Hitchhiker's Guide  to the  
00:29:59.230 Galaxy  which is  a book  
00:30:00.398 on philosophy in the  form of 
00:30:01.933 humor.  And the point that  
00:30:05.236 Adams was making  there was 
00:30:05.903 that  we  don't actually  
00:30:10.208 know  what  questions to  
00:30:11.075 ask.  That's  why I said  
00:30:13.344 that, you know, the answer is 
00:30:14.512 that  42. that, that  
00:30:15.079 Basically it's a giant  
00:30:16.147 computer  and and it  came  
00:30:17.582 up  with  the answer  42, but 
00:30:18.916 then  to actually figure  out 
00:30:19.984 what the  out what  figure  
00:30:20.585 actually  then to but 42, 
00:30:21.152 answer  with the  up  the 
00:30:21.719 question  is. That's  
00:30:25.556 Actual hard part  I 
00:30:26.023 think this is generally true  
00:30:26.657 also  in  physics at the  
00:30:27.224 point of which  you can 
00:30:28.826 properly  frame.  The 
00:30:29.927 question. The answer  is  is  
00:30:32.296 actually  the easy  part. So  
00:30:37.301 so so mi  order vation  then  
00:30:41.038 was that  well. My  life  is  
00:30:44.275 finite  really  a 
00:30:45.109 flash in the pan  and on  a 
00:30:46.344 galactic  time scale, but if  
00:30:50.247 we  can expand  the scope and 
00:30:51.949 scale of  consciousness.  
00:30:54.819 Then  we  are better  able  
00:30:55.553 to  figure  out what  
00:30:59.223 questions to ask  about the 
00:31:01.158 answer. That is the universe. 
00:31:05.162 And we're maybe we  can 
00:31:06.230 find out  the meaning of  
00:31:06.965 life  or  even  what  
00:31:08.232 question to what  the right 
00:31:09.734 question  to ask  is. 
00:31:13.371 You know, where do we come  
00:31:14.271 from? Where are we  going?  
00:31:17.575 Where are the aliens  are 
00:31:18.743 there aliens? 
00:31:22.346 At you know, these  these 
00:31:23.347 questions.  You you You know  
00:31:26.584 is  their new physics to  you 
00:31:28.152 discover  or  is this because 
00:31:30.721 there's addition to be some 
00:31:31.489 real  questions about 
00:31:32.556 dark matter and dark  energy  
00:31:34.358 energy. And so  the 
00:31:38.562 purpose of  SpaceX  
00:31:40.364 is to extend  life  beyond  
00:31:41.499 Earth on a  sustained basis 
00:31:44.902 so  that  we  can at least  
00:31:46.904 pass  one of  the Fermi great 
00:31:48.606 filters,  which is  that  of  
00:31:50.374 being a single  planet  
00:31:51.876 civilization  if we are 
00:31:53.510 single  planet civilization 
00:31:55.446 then  Then  we  are simply  
00:31:57.415 waiting around  for some  
00:31:58.883 then  Extinction  event 
00:31:59.483 whether that  is  man-made  
00:32:01.185 or  natural.  natural,  
00:32:03.254 natural.  But if  
00:32:05.089 you're a single planet  
00:32:05.689 civilization, eventually  you 
00:32:07.491 will  something will happen 
00:32:09.260 to  that  planet  and you 
00:32:10.694 will  die.  If  you 
00:32:11.962 were a multi-planet 
00:32:12.429 civilization, you will  live  
00:32:13.063 much  longer. Also  multi 
00:32:14.598 plant civilization  is  
00:32:17.334 that's the  natural stepping  
00:32:18.569 stone to  being a multi 
00:32:20.404 Stella  civilization  
00:32:21.639 and being out there Among the 
00:32:22.406 Stars so, you know this 
00:32:24.375 I think has To  that. This is 
00:32:31.049 not simply a defensive  
00:32:31.582 motivation, but it  is  also  
00:32:32.883 one where that  you know  
00:32:34.985 that  gives meaning 
00:32:36.887 Man's Search for meaning  
00:32:38.289 triple  
00:32:41.092 ask you if there's this 
00:32:41.626 philosophy  Point even  
00:32:42.193 though  it  may seems rather  
00:32:43.394 esoteric  that may resonate 
00:32:45.797 with  a few people. We  must  
00:32:48.499 get past  this  Fermi filter  
00:32:50.301 of  Venus a great future  of  
00:32:52.837 being a single  planet  
00:32:54.004 civilization. And if  we do 
00:32:56.607 that  will  more likely to  
00:32:58.809 understand  the nature  of  
00:32:59.510 the universe  and what  
00:33:00.611 questions to ask  if  you're  
00:33:04.014 a believer in the 
00:33:05.950 philosophy of curiosity then  
00:33:07.017 Philosophy of then  
00:33:07.751 philosophy of I think 
00:33:08.251 you should  support this  
00:33:09.553 Philosophy of ambition  and 
00:33:12.389 but it's more that  there's 
00:33:14.725 being a multi-planet  species 
00:33:15.993 is  more  than  than  simply. 
00:33:18.996 You know  life  
00:33:20.297 insurance life insurance  for 
00:33:20.998 Life  collectively. That's  a 
00:33:22.800 defensive reason, but but I 
00:33:25.202 think also  that  that life 
00:33:27.304 has to  be  more  than  
00:33:29.406 simply  solving one side  
00:33:31.542 problem after another,  
00:33:33.144 you know, they're happy that  
00:33:35.212 be  reasons many  where you 
00:33:36.781 wake up in the  morning and 
00:33:38.749 you're happy  to be alive.  
00:33:43.988 They have to be reasons that  
00:33:44.622 you you have to say.  
00:33:45.122 Why are you excited about the 
00:33:46.156 future  like what gives you 
00:33:48.559 hope? And and if  you if  you 
00:33:52.963 are unsure  ask your kids.  
00:33:56.267 And and I think the idea of 
00:33:58.702 us  being a spacefaring 
00:34:00.271 civilization  and being out 
00:34:01.271 there Among the Stars.  Is  
00:34:04.175 incredibly  inspiring and 
00:34:06.477 exciting  and something 
00:34:07.277 to look forward to. And they  
00:34:09.813 need  to be such  things  
00:34:10.681 in the  world.  
00:34:13.184 May I ask you a different 
00:34:13.751 question  about confidence? 
00:34:15.085 We were having  
00:34:15.985 a conversation here earlier,  
00:34:16.786 but people  and where your  
00:34:18.755 where people  get 
00:34:19.356 their Confidence  from  some  
00:34:20.891 people  have  written 
00:34:22.159 security  other people  have  
00:34:24.161 insecurity  great great 
00:34:24.695 confidence  and I was 
00:34:26.597 thinking  about you because 
00:34:29.867 you have  a very  interesting 
00:34:31.702 history where people  have  
00:34:33.304 told  you over  and over  
00:34:34.804 again that  you're wrong. 
00:34:37.174 Well, sometimes 
00:34:37.675 they're right.  Well, 
00:34:40.277 sometimes they  are but I 
00:34:41.110 would say that  when  
00:34:42.513 it comes  to  Tesla when it 
00:34:44.648 came  to  SpaceX  people  
00:34:45.949 told  you that  you were  
00:34:47.484 crazy.  You're out  of your 
00:34:48.518 mind. This  was never going 
00:34:49.219 to  happen. Yeah, 
00:34:50.420 it's going to work. And so  
00:34:51.722 yes,  we  ask you this  
00:34:52.822 though  and so  
00:34:53.757 we're going to work is  now 
00:34:55.960 when  people  say you're  
00:34:57.060 wrong.  This  isn't right.  
00:35:01.632 Do you  look at that  and say 
00:35:03.000 you know  what  that's  like  
00:35:03.634 a red flag  for me  because 
00:35:05.202 you know, I've been told  so  
00:35:06.370 often that  I'm wrong that  I 
00:35:09.173 know  that  I and I know  
00:35:10.608 I'm right because I've had  
00:35:11.375 that  experience  or  other 
00:35:14.144 people  in your life  
00:35:15.212 when they say,  you know, 
00:35:15.846 what  Ilan this is  not this  
00:35:17.614 is not  right.  Do  you know  
00:35:19.683 what  I'm saying? I mean, 
00:35:22.920 I think 
00:35:23.721 we're just trying to say is 
00:35:24.322 that  do  at this point think 
00:35:25.923 because 
00:35:26.490 what you're trying to say is  
00:35:27.124 I've been right so many times 
00:35:27.758 for others  have said I'm 
00:35:28.325 wrong that  now I passed  
00:35:29.660 believe I'm right when  
00:35:31.095 I fact I'm wrong. 
00:35:33.197 You did very well.  What  
00:35:35.399 do you  think 
00:35:37.101 know? I'm right.  
00:35:37.535 know? I'm right 
00:35:37.935 know? I'm right.  So  
00:35:43.407 yeah, no, look. Here's  
00:35:44.741 the thing No, I'm right.  
00:35:45.309 think?  
00:35:45.576 physics is unforgiving for. 
00:35:46.176 Yeah, look here's the thing 
00:35:47.511 physics is  unforgiving 
00:35:49.313 physics is  unforgiving.  So. 
00:35:54.018 I mean  I have  you know, 
00:35:55.052 these very  simple  things  
00:35:56.420 I've  come  up  with  that  
00:35:58.422 physics is  the law and 
00:35:59.523 everything  else  was a 
00:36:00.324 recommendation  right in  the 
00:36:02.393 sense that  you can break any 
00:36:04.628 law made  by  humans, but 
00:36:07.431 try breaking  a law made  by  
00:36:08.766 physics as  much  more  
00:36:10.034 difficult.  So  if  you are 
00:36:12.736 wrong and persistent  being 
00:36:14.872 wrong,  the Rockets will  
00:36:16.207 blow  up  and the cars  will  
00:36:17.775 fail. So  this  is  
00:36:23.614 we're not trying to 
00:36:24.648 figure out  what  
00:36:25.849 flavor of ice cream is  the 
00:36:27.251 best  flavor  Figure out  
00:36:27.985 figure out  of  ice cream the 
00:36:29.653 like  if  there's a 
00:36:31.455 thousand things that  can 
00:36:32.056 happen  on  a rocket  flight  
00:36:35.059 and only  one of  them  gets  
00:36:37.194 the rocket orbit. and And so  
00:36:39.396 being wrong and And 
00:36:41.198 results in  Failure 
00:36:44.134 when dealing  with  physical  
00:36:45.602 objects,  but that's  
00:36:47.137 the interesting part. So now  
00:36:47.771 you've  built this  these 
00:36:49.039 great companies that  
00:36:50.841 physically  the physics of  
00:36:52.142 them  are enormously  
00:36:53.877 successful. So  successful  
00:36:55.846 arguably  that  you have  
00:36:57.748 leverage  over  everybody 
00:36:59.016 else, right?  There's nobody  
00:37:00.484 else  can do  starlink. 
00:37:01.785 Nobody  else  can get I 
00:37:03.987 nobody else can get the 
00:37:05.356 rockets in space  yet Amazon  
00:37:06.390 and Jeff  Bezos are trying  
00:37:07.591 but they  haven't yet.  
00:37:09.259 I hope  he does you hope  
00:37:10.661 he does.  Yeah, and I think 
00:37:12.830 you know, but I actually  
00:37:15.366 agree with  with  love  
00:37:16.533 Jeff's  motivations.  I mean, 
00:37:18.602 I think you know  he's  so  
00:37:24.174 I'm living for their  
00:37:25.509 but this way  if  
00:37:26.210 there was a button  I could 
00:37:26.811 press that  would delete  
00:37:28.545 blue origin.  I wouldn't  
00:37:29.112 press it. So  I think it's  
00:37:32.449 good  that  he's spending 
00:37:33.284 money on  on  making  Rockets 
00:37:35.352 to  you know, it's just 
00:37:38.722 Pepsi spend more time.  it  
00:37:39.757 but you know, it's  up  It  
00:37:40.924 to  him the 
00:37:46.363 to make a point here. So  
00:37:48.665 nothing nothing any of  my  
00:37:50.167 companies have  done  has 
00:37:51.268 been  to  stifle  
00:37:52.603 competition.  In  fact, we've 
00:37:54.404 done  the opposite. So  at  
00:37:56.540 Tesla we  have  open  sourced 
00:37:58.776 our patents anyone  can use 
00:38:01.078 anyone  patents our sourced 
00:38:01.679 open  have  we  Tesla at  So  
00:38:02.313 opposite. the done  our 
00:38:02.846 patents for free  how many  
00:38:04.148 companies do  not have done 
00:38:04.849 that? Can you name one? I 
00:38:09.153 can't at SpaceX.  We  don't 
00:38:12.423 use patterns. So  I mean  
00:38:16.560 said  once in a while will  
00:38:17.994 file a  patent  just  so some 
00:38:19.163 patent  troll doesn't 
00:38:20.264 cause trouble but we're not 
00:38:23.467 stopping  any 
00:38:24.568 that we've done we've done  
00:38:25.169 nothing anti-competitive. 
00:38:26.970 We've done  nothing to  stop  
00:38:28.872 a not just you  at all. 
00:38:30.374 I just want to  clarify 
00:38:30.908 for the audience  because 
00:38:31.875 some  companies have  done  
00:38:33.644 done  anti-competitive  
00:38:34.578 things. I think think the I 
00:38:36.213 things. anti-competitive  
00:38:36.780 done  have  companies the 
00:38:37.347 strange thing about the 
00:38:41.285 unusual.  Thing about 
00:38:41.785 space X and Tesla is  
00:38:42.286 that we've done things  that  
00:38:42.920 have  helped  a competition.  
00:38:43.620 So  at  Tesla we  have  made  
00:38:46.924 our supercharger  system  
00:38:49.059 Open  Access. We  made  our 
00:38:53.530 we  Access, We  Access. 
00:38:54.064 charger technology  we  
00:38:54.698 Access, available for free  
00:38:55.933 to the  other manufacturers.  
00:38:58.235 The reason  I know  
00:38:59.436 Walled Garden we  could have  
00:39:00.070 put a wall  up  
00:39:02.072 the road instead. We  invited 
00:39:02.706 them  in  the reason  I 
00:39:03.841 mention this  though  is  
00:39:04.442 because you've had  
00:39:05.275 the success had you've  
00:39:05.809 because though is this  
00:39:06.343 mention I reason  the 
00:39:06.843 the success in the  physical  
00:39:07.477 physics world,  you know. 
00:39:10.581 Now have  now have  these 
00:39:11.148 very  difficult Now have  
00:39:11.715 decisions now have  that  
00:39:12.283 have  huge  impacts on  the 
00:39:12.883 world that are  not physical  
00:39:14.585 decisions at all  their 
00:39:16.286 decisions of the  Mind  the 
00:39:17.788 decisions that  you and 
00:39:19.423 others  have  to  make  
00:39:20.190 it as a question  whether you 
00:39:20.824 should  be making these 
00:39:21.525 decisions at all  and I think 
00:39:23.594 about in the  context of  
00:39:25.429 starlink. Obviously there 
00:39:26.263 was the report  about how 
00:39:28.432 it's being  used  in  Ukraine 
00:39:29.766 and the rough War there's 
00:39:31.201 questions about what  you 
00:39:32.669 know, Taiwan  whether Taiwan  
00:39:34.571 should  use it  or  
00:39:35.572 we'll use it. I believe 
00:39:36.607 they're not right now because 
00:39:38.475 they're worried that  at  At  
00:39:39.109 at  some  point maybe the 
00:39:39.910 Chinese At  will  tell  you 
00:39:40.577 that  you have  to  
00:39:42.312 they have leverage  over  you 
00:39:42.946 and you're  going to  have  
00:39:43.547 to  turn  that  off right 
00:39:45.115 then. These are these are 
00:39:46.316 very  difficult decisions.  
00:39:47.751 And I'm so  curious how 
00:39:48.719 you think how you curious so  
00:39:49.353 I'm and decisions,  difficult 
00:39:49.987 very  are these about that  
00:39:50.588 and not just  the 
00:39:51.321 decisions the fact that you 
00:39:52.022 have  that  power.  I think 
00:39:58.094 it's important  for the 
00:39:58.628 audience to understand. The 
00:39:59.229 reason I have these Powers  
00:39:59.830 not because of  some  
00:40:00.330 anti-competitive  actions 
00:40:00.897 it simply because we've 
00:40:01.431 executed  very well.  Oh, I'm 
00:40:02.466 not dismissing  that I  think 
00:40:03.534 there's so many people  
00:40:04.268 by the  way who are huge  
00:40:05.335 supporters  of  what  you 
00:40:06.403 there are already dead lights 
00:40:07.504 out there,  you know, but 
00:40:09.573 they're and but they're not 
00:40:10.174 as good as  yours and 
00:40:11.375 the same  and we can  say 
00:40:11.976 that  maybe make the same 
00:40:13.176 argument  of  cars  and 
00:40:13.777 everything  else. But as  a 
00:40:15.045 result  that  gives that  
00:40:16.213 result  a as  But else. 
00:40:16.747 everything  and cars  of  
00:40:17.314 argument  same  gives you 
00:40:17.881 enormous  Leverage  Right,  
00:40:21.351 okay  with  the exception of  
00:40:21.985 the by the  way,  these 
00:40:22.519 advertisers weren't on X  in  
00:40:23.153 every other instance. 
00:40:23.654 Everybody needs you.  Well, 
00:40:27.257 I mean  nobody's  letting 
00:40:29.459 them use our  product if it's 
00:40:30.093 better  than  you somebody  
00:40:31.194 else's  product. If it's  
00:40:31.895 there are other 
00:40:33.063 products better and I 
00:40:34.298 accept that and maybe one day 
00:40:35.832 so I can also create a better 
00:40:36.466 product.  Like, you know, 
00:40:38.402 like, product Like, product.  
00:40:39.036 how like, product is it about 
00:40:39.670 thing to  make  better  
00:40:41.071 products  
00:40:41.905 with other companies? Well, 
00:40:42.906 and I wanted to go back to  
00:40:44.207 this  to  the 
00:40:45.409 Starling piece of it  though  
00:40:46.043 because it  that  has sort of 
00:40:46.944 a geo 
00:40:49.279 geo political ramification  
00:40:49.880 in  terms of  your  power and 
00:40:52.049 how you think about that  
00:40:53.784 specific  power and then  
00:40:55.619 the power that  the u.s.  
00:40:56.486 Government  might have  
00:40:57.387 either  over  you or  Not 
00:40:58.522 Over  Not or  you over  
00:40:59.489 either  have  might 
00:40:59.956 Government  u.s.  the that  
00:41:00.557 power Over You the  The power 
00:41:04.561 of the  Chinese government  
00:41:05.162 might have  over  you or  not 
00:41:05.796 over  you and how those 
00:41:06.330 things  get used. 
00:41:08.865 We're in what are you 
00:41:09.365 suggesting? I'm asking  the 
00:41:11.602 question  around  this  this  
00:41:12.803 very  idea  of  how these 
00:41:15.606 satellites  are going to  be  
00:41:17.107 used. Whether you think that  
00:41:18.508 you should  have  control of  
00:41:19.376 control have  should  you 
00:41:19.943 think that  you Whether used. 
00:41:20.577 be  to  of  them  whether the 
00:41:21.211 government  should  have  
00:41:21.778 control of  them  was the 
00:41:24.648 government. Well, that's  a 
00:41:25.415 there's a lot of  people who  
00:41:26.049 don't trust the government  
00:41:27.417 exactly.  But then  this  
00:41:28.418 goes  back to the trust of  
00:41:29.586 you.  Right?  I mean  like  
00:41:31.989 said that we're not the only  
00:41:34.024 company who has communication 
00:41:35.425 satellites. There are 
00:41:36.793 considered  lights are just 
00:41:37.728 much  better  than  theirs. 
00:41:39.429 So  it's  not like  we  have  
00:41:41.732 added Monopoly. Do you  feel  
00:41:43.667 do you feel like  anybody has 
00:41:44.701 attacked? has 
00:41:45.068 you feel like anybody do  
00:41:45.635 you feel  do  Monopoly  
00:41:46.169 haven't 
00:41:46.436 attacked? It's not like 
00:41:46.970 you feel  anybody has 
00:41:47.470 leverage  over  you.  I mean, 
00:41:53.743 I think at the end  
00:41:54.211 of the day if we  make  bad 
00:41:55.112 products that 
00:41:55.579 people don't want to  use 
00:41:56.580 then  the vote  will  users 
00:41:58.848 to use then the don't want  
00:41:59.449 people  that  
00:41:59.816 if we make bad products users 
00:42:00.450 will  vote  with  their 
00:42:01.785 resources and you something 
00:42:05.889 else. It  hit the 
00:42:06.690 conversation  for a 
00:42:07.290 sec. I mean certainly 
00:42:09.192 me and my company is  
00:42:09.692 overseen by regulators  and 
00:42:11.194 and while you know, once  it  
00:42:14.565 once  know, you while and 
00:42:15.132 by regulators 
00:42:15.499 and my company is overseen  
00:42:16.100 it since  SpaceX darling  
00:42:21.004 Tesla.  Are overseen by are 
00:42:22.840 Are cumulatively  are over  
00:42:25.409 100 Regulators  in  actually  
00:42:28.378 more than that  few hundred 
00:42:29.513 Regulators  because you got 
00:42:30.947 we're in 55 countries if  you 
00:42:36.453 sum up  all the times that  I 
00:42:38.088 If  countries.  had an  
00:42:38.622 argument  with  Regulators  
00:42:40.023 of  hundreds  of  regulators  
00:42:42.092 over  decades,  it  can sound 
00:42:45.429 really  terrible  except  
00:42:47.531 but they forgot to  mention 
00:42:48.632 that  there were  10 million. 
00:42:50.333 Galatians we  complied  with  
00:42:51.501 and only  five  that  I 
00:42:53.603 disagree  with  
00:42:56.039 that little fight the five  
00:42:56.640 and it  sounds like wow 
00:42:57.708 this guy's a real Maverick. 
00:42:58.542 I'm like, yeah, 
00:42:59.342 but what about  the 10  
00:43:00.143 million we  complied with 
00:43:01.344 do you  limit one related 
00:43:03.647 thing on  this  and The 
00:43:04.948 Leverage  of  countries and 
00:43:05.749 things  over  you and 
00:43:07.050 Regulators  X is this free  
00:43:10.153 speech  platform, you 
00:43:11.155 platform  do  platform, 
00:43:11.689 business  platform  in  China 
00:43:12.589 lots of business  China.  
00:43:13.790 That's an important part of 
00:43:14.591 your  business. I imagine 
00:43:15.992 well  not SpaceX. How do you  
00:43:19.596 think about how do you  the 
00:43:20.797 How do you  leverage  that  
00:43:21.665 the Chinese have  over  you 
00:43:23.934 and do  they  have  leverage  
00:43:25.135 over  you and how do  you 
00:43:26.303 feel  about some  people  
00:43:27.804 would say is  it  
00:43:28.405 hypocritical  for you to be 
00:43:30.507 doing business  in  China or  
00:43:32.375 frankly in other  countries 
00:43:33.210 as well as it relates to  
00:43:33.777 X and other things  that  
00:43:35.345 don't follow  this  free  
00:43:36.413 this  follow  don't that  
00:43:36.980 things  and other X 
00:43:37.448 Where as it relates to  free  
00:43:38.082 speech  path  that  you have  
00:43:42.452 espoused. The best  that  
00:43:43.754 their platform  can do  is  
00:43:45.155 adhere to the laws  of  Any 
00:43:45.856 Given country.  Do  you think 
00:43:48.258 there's something more  
00:43:48.792 we could  do  than  that  
00:43:50.360 I think would be  very  hard. 
00:43:51.261 But I just  wonder given  the 
00:43:53.096 sort of strong  philosophical 
00:43:55.265 approach  that  you've  
00:43:57.100 you've been vocal about 
00:43:58.301 whether you say to yourself,  
00:44:00.203 you know, maybe I shouldn't 
00:44:00.804 be  doing business  in  that  
00:44:02.172 country.  Well, first of all  
00:44:06.943 Starling  and SpaceX  to  are 
00:44:09.446 no business in  China 
00:44:09.946 whatsoever. Tesla has one of  
00:44:13.583 four  factories for vehicle 
00:44:15.285 factories in  China and 
00:44:17.454 China's,  you know, I 
00:44:18.889 don't know  a quarter of  our 
00:44:20.590 Market or something like  
00:44:21.158 that. And so it's a quarter 
00:44:22.659 of  Market of one company.  
00:44:25.028 The same  is true by the way  
00:44:25.929 of  all the other 
00:44:27.297 car companies.  They  also  
00:44:28.999 have  something on that order 
00:44:30.200 of  that order  on  something 
00:44:30.834 have  also  companies. They 
00:44:31.435 car the other of  quarter of  
00:44:32.069 their sales in China. So  if  
00:44:39.175 you if that's a problem for 
00:44:39.842 Tesla 
00:44:40.076 to pump every car company.  
00:44:40.677 I mean, I think 
00:44:41.077 one has to be careful about 
00:44:41.678 not conflating  the various 
00:44:44.047 companies because I can only  
00:44:46.583 do  things  that  are within  
00:44:47.418 the bounds  of the  law.  I 
00:44:48.452 cannot  do  beyond  that. My  
00:44:51.188 aspiration  is to do  as much 
00:44:51.955 good  as  possible  and 
00:44:53.190 to be as  productive  as  
00:44:54.691 possible within the bounds  
00:44:55.292 of  what  is legal. More than 
00:44:57.661 that  I cannot do I want  to  
00:45:00.096 Pivot in talk about AI  for a 
00:45:01.298 moment. We had  
00:45:02.299 Jensen Wong here  who's big 
00:45:03.500 fan of  yours is  you know, 
00:45:04.768 yeah  Johnson's also  
00:45:06.403 talk about  talking about 
00:45:07.070 bringing  you the first box 
00:45:08.338 by  the way with  Ilya  
00:45:10.707 interestingly enough. Yes 
00:45:12.375 back  in  2016. I think 
00:45:14.444 there's a video of  Jensen  
00:45:16.847 and be unpacking  the first 
00:45:20.150 AI computer at  open a.i. So  
00:45:23.587 I'm so  curious what you  
00:45:24.454 think of  what's  just  
00:45:25.388 happened  over the  past  
00:45:27.157 two weeks 
00:45:28.592 while you were dealing  with  
00:45:29.226 this  other headline  series  
00:45:33.329 of  headlines.  I was a whole 
00:45:35.032 other whole 
00:45:35.365 headlines. I was a  of  
00:45:35.899 series  headline  other this  
00:45:36.533 with  series  of  
00:45:36.967 have evolved  in a  
00:45:37.434 isopropanol AI. What  did you 
00:45:38.635 think?  Well, you found it  
00:45:46.076 co-founded. Oh found it. Yeah,
00:45:47.043 I'm well  the whole Well  
00:45:50.147 well  Arc Well  of  open  
00:45:50.981 and I frankly is  a little  
00:45:52.449 troubling because the the 
00:45:54.885 reason  for starting  opening 
00:45:56.386 I was to create a counter 
00:45:57.420 counterweight to  Google  
00:45:59.789 Google  and deepmind which  
00:46:00.891 at the  time  had 
00:46:03.593 two thirds of all AI  talent  
00:46:05.829 and basically infinite  money 
00:46:07.230 and compute and there was no  
00:46:09.466 there's no  counter weight. 
00:46:10.133 It was  unipolar  world and 
00:46:12.636 Larry Page and  I used  to be 
00:46:13.536 very  close friends and I 
00:46:14.638 would stay  at  his house and 
00:46:15.472 I and house his stay at 
00:46:16.006 I would and friends close 
00:46:16.573 be very to  and I talk  
00:46:17.107 to Larry. Too late  hours 
00:46:20.877 of the night  about AI  
00:46:21.444 safety  too late  Too late  
00:46:22.112 too late  and it became 
00:46:23.146 apparent  to me that  Larry 
00:46:26.650 what  did not care  about AI  
00:46:28.218 safety. I think perhaps the 
00:46:30.353 thing that  gave  it  away  
00:46:31.454 was when  he  called  me  a 
00:46:32.923 speciesist  for being pro 
00:46:34.724 Humanity  as  in  you know, 
00:46:37.761 like  erasers but for species 
00:46:41.564 so  I'm like, wait  a second. 
00:46:43.867 What side are you on  Larry?  
00:46:49.472 And I'm like, okay. Listen  
00:46:50.073 this guy  calling 
00:46:50.506 me as fishiest. It doesn't  
00:46:51.107 care  about AI safety.  We've 
00:46:53.276 got to  have  some  
00:46:54.878 counter point here because  
00:46:55.679 the seems like  we could  be  
00:46:59.616 this isn't just this  is  no  
00:47:00.617 good. So, okay. I was 
00:47:03.186 actually  started at  it  was 
00:47:04.521 meant to  be  open source.  I 
00:47:06.623 named it  over and II after 
00:47:09.426 open  source. It  is in fact  
00:47:12.429 closed-source super 
00:47:12.929 in fact closed-source is  It  
00:47:13.563 source. open  my eye after  
00:47:14.164 over  super close.  
00:47:14.631 You should be named renamed 
00:47:16.466 super close source for maximum
00:47:17.834 profit. May I so  because 
00:47:21.337 this  is  what  it  actually  
00:47:22.205 is. I mean  fate loves  
00:47:25.775 irony.  I mean, in fact 
00:47:29.712 friend  of mine has this  
00:47:31.548 says  like  the way to  
00:47:32.348 predict outcomes  is  the 
00:47:32.915 most  ironic  outcome is  to  
00:47:34.351 vote. It's like is  
00:47:34.818 Occam's razor like  
00:47:35.785 the simplest  sort of 
00:47:36.719 explanation is  most  likely  
00:47:38.154 and my  friend  
00:47:39.956 join us viewers that  the 
00:47:40.523 most  ironic  outcome is  the 
00:47:41.658 most  likely  and that's  
00:47:42.993 what's happened with  
00:47:43.593 open a.i. It's  gone  from  
00:47:45.362 an  open  source. Foundation  
00:47:50.433 a 501 C3 to Suddenly  It's  
00:47:52.069 like  a 90 billion dollar 
00:47:53.870 for profit Corporation  with  
00:47:54.504 clothes horse.  So I  
00:47:56.339 don't know  how you go  from  
00:47:57.540 here  to  there.  But 
00:47:59.242 that seems  like  a 
00:48:01.177 I don't know  how you get.  I 
00:48:02.779 don't know if this is legal.  
00:48:04.514 It's like that's  so as you 
00:48:06.449 saw Sam Altman  get ousted  
00:48:08.418 Yeah  by  somebody, you know  
00:48:09.786 Elia  and helium  was 
00:48:11.388 somebody  who was a friend of 
00:48:12.222 yours.  Yes,  you brought him 
00:48:13.523 there your  relationship  
00:48:15.292 with  Larry Page  
00:48:16.326 effectively.  Down  over  you 
00:48:20.030 recruiting  him away. 
00:48:20.530 I think that's correct. 
00:48:21.064 That was the  fact that was 
00:48:21.665 the Larry refuse to be  
00:48:22.266 friends with  me  after I 
00:48:23.033 recruited illya and so  
00:48:25.168 here's  Elia  apparently  
00:48:27.037 saying  something is  very  
00:48:28.338 wrong.  I think we  should be 
00:48:30.239 concerned about this  because 
00:48:31.041 I think Elly  actually  has a 
00:48:32.375 strong  moral compass.  
00:48:34.878 He thinks about you know, 
00:48:36.179 he really sweats  it  over  
00:48:38.948 questions of  what  is  right 
00:48:40.950 and if  he felt strongly  
00:48:42.752 enough  to  Want to you know  
00:48:47.156 fire  Sam Sam.  Well, I think 
00:48:49.292 the world should  know  what  
00:48:51.361 was that  reason. Have  you 
00:48:52.662 talked to him?  I reached out 
00:48:55.031 but he  doesn't want to 
00:48:55.932 talk to anyone. Have you  
00:48:57.534 talked to other people  
00:48:58.368 behind  the scenes  is  this  
00:48:59.335 is  all happening.  
00:49:01.838 I've talked to a lot of 
00:49:02.372 people  as  nobody  I've  not 
00:49:07.077 found anyone. Who knows why 
00:49:10.246 have  you I think we  are all 
00:49:12.448 still trying  to  find  out 
00:49:14.884 I mean  one of two things is  
00:49:16.853 either  it was  a serious 
00:49:17.920 thing and we should know what 
00:49:19.589 it  is  or  it was  not 
00:49:20.590 a serious thing and and then  
00:49:22.091 the board should resign.  
00:49:23.993 What  do you  think 
00:49:25.061 of Sam Altman?  
00:49:28.531 I have mixed feelings about 
00:49:29.132 Sam.  I do. You know  the 
00:49:36.573 ring of power.  You know  can 
00:49:39.642 corrupt.  and 
00:49:45.348 here's the ring of power  so  
00:49:50.954 You know, I don't know. 
00:49:51.988 I think I want to know  why 
00:49:54.591 Ilya felt so  strongly  as  
00:49:55.892 fire Sam  the sounds  like  a 
00:49:57.760 serious thing.  I don't think 
00:49:59.395 it  was trivial.  and And I'm 
00:50:02.165 and quite concerned that  
00:50:03.933 this  that  this  um, you 
00:50:06.503 know  you dangerous element 
00:50:07.270 of  AI that they've 
00:50:08.838 they've discovered? Yes,  you 
00:50:10.039 think they've discovered  
00:50:11.341 something?  
00:50:12.675 That would be my guess. Where 
00:50:15.345 are you with your own AI  
00:50:17.981 efforts relative  to  where 
00:50:20.550 you think open  AI  is  where 
00:50:22.185 you think Google is.  where 
00:50:26.456 the others are  I mean  
00:50:32.462 on the AI front of in 
00:50:32.962 somewhat of a quandary  here  
00:50:34.164 because I've  thought I could 
00:50:38.067 be  something that  would 
00:50:38.735 change  the world 
00:50:40.170 in a significant way  since 
00:50:40.804 I was in  college.  I mean  
00:50:41.704 like  30 years  ago.  Well, 
00:50:44.073 the reason  I didn't  go  
00:50:46.176 college,  bull day. I 
00:50:47.677 write for the get-go  
00:50:48.177 was because I was uncertain 
00:50:49.679 about which which edge  
00:50:52.282 of the  double-edged  sword 
00:50:53.483 which would be  sharper the 
00:50:55.385 good  edge  of the  vat Edge. 
00:50:58.521 So  I held  off on  
00:51:00.089 doing anything  on  a I could 
00:51:00.890 have  created.  I think 
00:51:02.592 leading a company and kind of 
00:51:04.994 opening I actually  kind of 
00:51:05.595 is  that  because I was just  
00:51:09.866 uncertain if  you make  this  
00:51:11.000 magic Genie what  will  
00:51:12.468 happen? you know, where as I  
00:51:15.772 think 
00:51:18.408 Building sustainable energy 
00:51:19.009 technology  is  much  more  
00:51:19.776 of a  single-edged sword. 
00:51:20.977 That  is  that  
00:51:22.211 single-edged sword  single  
00:51:22.812 edge. Good  making  life  
00:51:25.315 multiplanetary. I think 
00:51:26.482 single-edged  good. 
00:51:30.887 You're stalling mostly  
00:51:32.222 single-edged  good. I mean  
00:51:33.022 giving people better  
00:51:33.790 connectivity  to  people  
00:51:34.991 that  you know, don't don't 
00:51:36.158 you know  have  connectivity  
00:51:36.926 or  too expensive I think is  
00:51:39.996 very, you know, very much a 
00:51:41.698 good  thing.  So  only  was 
00:51:45.401 instrumental  by  the way and 
00:51:47.103 the whole thing the Russian 
00:51:47.704 Advance the Ukrainian said  
00:51:49.505 so  so, you know, I think 
00:51:52.842 there's think know, I so, you 
00:51:53.643 so  said  Ukrainian the 
00:51:54.177 Advance Russian the 
00:51:54.644 if it was AI, you've  got the 
00:51:56.245 magic Genie.  Problem.  
00:52:00.183 You may think you want  
00:52:00.917 a magic Genie.  But once  
00:52:04.988 you've  got Genies  
00:52:05.621 out of the  bottle, it's hard 
00:52:07.657 to say  what  happens how far 
00:52:09.726 are we  away  from  that  
00:52:11.427 Jeanne be kind of bodily think
00:52:12.061 we  think it's  already out.  
00:52:14.931 When  the genie is  
00:52:15.999 certainly poking his  head  
00:52:16.799 out.  the AGI The the idea of 
00:52:21.137 the artificial  general 
00:52:21.737 intelligence  The given 
00:52:23.406 what you  now are working on  
00:52:24.374 yourself  and you know  how 
00:52:25.975 easy or hard  it is to  train 
00:52:28.378 to  create  the inferences  
00:52:29.712 to  create the  wait. I hope  
00:52:31.947 I'm not getting too far 
00:52:33.316 in the  weeds of  just  how 
00:52:34.317 this  works.  But those 
00:52:35.718 are the basics  behind  the 
00:52:37.520 software  end of this.  
00:52:41.591 It's funny, you know all  
00:52:42.158 these weights.  They're just  
00:52:43.626 basically numbers in  a 
00:52:44.494 are just  weights 
00:52:44.928 It's funny, you know, all 
00:52:45.495 comma separated value file. 
00:52:46.596 That's  our digital God the 
00:52:48.531 CSV file. on that are funny,  
00:52:52.068 On that are on that are 
00:52:52.602 On that are but that's  
00:52:57.473 the kind  of  literally what  
00:52:58.207 it  is. So  I think it's  
00:53:01.644 coming  pretty  fast, 
00:53:02.745 you know  is that I mean, 
00:53:05.114 you've  famously  have  
00:53:06.516 admitted  to  overstating how 
00:53:07.650 quickly things  will  happen. 
00:53:08.851 But how quickly do you think  
00:53:10.320 this  will  happen? You say 
00:53:17.126 smarter than  the smartest  
00:53:17.827 human at  anything. Yep.  It  
00:53:21.964 may not be  then  quite 
00:53:23.933 smarter than  all humans  
00:53:26.369 will  machine 
00:53:27.170 augmented humans, you know, 
00:53:28.204 because we  keep  y'all got 
00:53:29.372 computers and stuff 
00:53:31.974 as a higher bar.  But you say 
00:53:33.476 smaller than  any,  you know, 
00:53:35.778 can write as  good  a 
00:53:36.679 novel is say  JK  Rowling or  
00:53:39.582 discover new  physics or  
00:53:40.583 invent  new technology. I 
00:53:43.753 would say that  we are  less  
00:53:44.587 than  three years from  
00:53:45.254 that point. Let me  ask you 
00:53:47.624 a question  about xai and at  
00:53:50.059 what  you're  doing and 
00:53:51.761 because there's an  
00:53:52.528 interesting thing that's  
00:53:53.529 different.  I think about 
00:53:54.931 what  you have  relatives 
00:53:57.166 of some of the others which 
00:53:57.800 you have  data  you have  
00:53:59.001 information you have  all of  
00:54:01.003 the stuff that  everybody in  
00:54:02.772 here  has put on  the 
00:54:04.674 platform  to  sort  through 
00:54:07.176 and through sort  to  
00:54:07.676 platform  the on  put has 
00:54:08.244 here  in  everybody I don't 
00:54:12.615 Everybody realized that 
00:54:13.149 initially.  What is the value 
00:54:13.783 of  that? Yeah, I'm data  is  
00:54:21.791 very  important.  You could 
00:54:25.127 say that is probably  
00:54:26.362 more valuable than  gold. But 
00:54:29.532 then  maybe you have  
00:54:30.333 actually  maybe you have  
00:54:31.067 more  you maybe you have  the 
00:54:32.568 gold  in  X in a  different 
00:54:34.604 way in a way  again that  I 
00:54:37.373 don't know  if the  public  
00:54:38.274 appreciates what  that  
00:54:39.475 means.  Yes,  X is the  
00:54:44.981 might be  the single  
00:54:45.848 best source of  data. I mean  
00:54:49.652 it  is  there more. You know  
00:54:53.122 people  links that  go  to  
00:54:55.425 fill  click on  more  links 
00:54:56.826 2x than anything  else  on  
00:54:57.427 Earth.  Sometimes 
00:54:58.728 people think  Facebook  or  
00:54:59.862 Instagram is  a bigger  
00:55:00.863 thing,  but actually  
00:55:02.131 there are more  links to  
00:55:02.965 external  anything  you can 
00:55:04.867 this is public information  
00:55:05.468 you can Google  it. Okay. Let 
00:55:06.102 me  ask you a so  it  is  
00:55:08.771 it is a where you would find  
00:55:11.374 what  is  happening right now 
00:55:12.375 on  Earth at any  given point 
00:55:14.210 in time the whole open  a 
00:55:15.611 drama played  out out.  out 
00:55:16.279 in  fact  In  out.  on  the 
00:55:18.014 export form.  So  it  is  one 
00:55:21.083 is  it  form. So  expert  the 
00:55:21.717 on  fact  out.  played  drama 
00:55:22.351 open a  of the  it's  
00:55:22.852 not there.  Are you know  
00:55:26.423 Google  certainly has a 
00:55:26.956 massive amount of data  so  
00:55:27.557 does  Microsoft?  So  it's  
00:55:30.159 not like  
00:55:31.661 B is one of the best  sources 
00:55:32.295 of  data. Can I ask you 
00:55:36.065 an interesting  IP  issue,  
00:55:37.867 which I think is  actually  
00:55:38.768 something I can say as  
00:55:40.570 somebody  who's in  the 
00:55:41.571 Creator business  and 
00:55:42.772 journalistic  business and  
00:55:43.873 whatnot were care about 
00:55:46.075 copyright.  So  one of  the 
00:55:48.944 things  about training  on  
00:55:50.379 data  has been  this idea 
00:55:51.781 that  you're not  going to  
00:55:52.782 train or  these things  are 
00:55:53.883 not being trained on  
00:55:55.485 people's  copyrighted 
00:55:56.285 information historically, 
00:55:57.787 that's  been  the concept.  
00:55:58.788 Yeah. That's  a huge  lie.  
00:56:00.289 Say that again. 
00:56:01.724 That's what these 
00:56:03.025 are. These are  all trained 
00:56:03.826 on  copyrighted it  obviously 
00:56:05.928 so you think  it's a  lie 
00:56:07.230 when  open  a.i.  Says that 
00:56:09.332 this  is  not none  of these  
00:56:10.466 guys  say they're training on 
00:56:12.201 copyrighted day though. 
00:56:13.269 That's a  lie. It's a lie 
00:56:14.337 a lie. It's a though. That's  
00:56:14.971 day copyrighted on  
00:56:15.438 guys had their training 
00:56:15.972 straight up straight  up  
00:56:16.539 lie.  Okay  our said  
00:56:22.445 soon obviously it's 
00:56:22.912 been trained  on  perforated  
00:56:23.546 data. Okay. So  let me ask  
00:56:24.147 the second question which is  
00:56:24.781 all of the  people  who have  
00:56:25.448 been  uploading and it's like 
00:56:28.050 whatever minute all of  the 
00:56:28.651 people  have been uploading 
00:56:30.653 articles  the best  quotes  
00:56:32.388 from  different articles  
00:56:34.657 videos  to  X all of  that  
00:56:38.394 can be  trained on  and it's  
00:56:40.296 interesting because people  
00:56:41.264 put all of  that  there and 
00:56:43.132 there of that all put people  
00:56:43.766 because interesting it's  and 
00:56:44.400 and those quotes  have  
00:56:44.934 historically been considered  
00:56:46.168 fair  use Right,  they do 
00:56:48.504 people  are putting those 
00:56:49.071 quotes  up  the and 
00:56:49.538 individually  on  a fair use  
00:56:50.205 spaces  you'd say 
00:56:51.474 OK that makes sense.  But now 
00:56:53.543 there are people  who do  
00:56:54.610 threads and by  the way,  
00:56:55.411 there may be multiple people  
00:56:56.612 who've done,  you know  at  
00:56:58.414 article could has a thousand  
00:56:59.381 words technically all 
00:57:00.683 thousand  words could have  
00:57:01.350 made  it  onto  X somehow and 
00:57:04.654 effectively now you have this 
00:57:06.188 remarkable  repository  and I 
00:57:08.357 wonder  what  you how you 
00:57:09.592 think about that  again and 
00:57:11.027 how you think the creative  
00:57:11.994 community and those who were  
00:57:14.597 the original  original Ip.  
00:57:15.198 the were  who those and 
00:57:15.731 community creative  the A 
00:57:19.869 owners  should  think 
00:57:20.369 about that. I don't know  
00:57:21.103 except  to say  that  the by  
00:57:21.804 the time  these lawsuits  are 
00:57:23.005 decided we'll have  digital 
00:57:24.173 God.  So  that's  
00:57:26.041 that's digital. 
00:57:26.442 that's digital  
00:57:26.842 that's digital. God at that 
00:57:27.443 point.  that's digital  These 
00:57:29.011 lawsuits  won't be  decided 
00:57:29.712 before  on a  
00:57:31.714 time frame that is  relevant. 
00:57:33.616 Is  frame that is relevant. 
00:57:34.217 a time  on  before  decided 
00:57:34.817 be  won't Is that a good  
00:57:35.384 thing or a bad  thing?  
00:57:41.591 I think we live you know, 
00:57:42.158 there's that  I don't know  
00:57:43.092 if  it's  actually  a real  
00:57:44.093 Chinese thing or not, but 
00:57:46.228 may you live  in interesting  
00:57:46.862 times?  But apparently  not 
00:57:50.566 but times,  a But times?  
00:57:51.133 good thing, but times,  but 
00:57:53.869 good thing  good thing, 
00:57:54.570 good thing  and I would 
00:57:55.104 prefer  to  personally  
00:57:55.704 I would prefer  to  live  in  
00:57:56.639 interesting times and and we  
00:57:58.808 live  in  the most  
00:58:00.309 interesting of  times.  
00:58:02.144 I think for a while 
00:58:04.847 there. I was  like  really  
00:58:05.648 getting demotivated and 
00:58:06.949 losing  sleep over. 
00:58:09.352 the sort of the threat of 
00:58:10.486 AI danger and then  I finally 
00:58:11.854 sort of became  fatalistic  
00:58:13.189 about it  and said  well  
00:58:15.424 Even  if  I knew  it  was 
00:58:18.527 Annihilation was  certain.  
00:58:21.397 What  I choose  to be alive 
00:58:22.365 what  What  at  that  time  
00:58:24.800 or  not,  what  and I said  
00:58:25.735 I probably  would have  
00:58:27.336 choose to be alive  at that 
00:58:27.937 time  because it's the  most  
00:58:28.704 interesting thing.  Even  if  
00:58:31.007 there was nothing I could do  
00:58:31.641 about it. So  then, you know, 
00:58:32.976 then  basically sort of a 
00:58:35.244 fatalistic  resignation help  
00:58:37.580 me  sleep at  night because I 
00:58:38.447 was having  trouble sleeping  
00:58:39.382 at night  because of  AI  
00:58:40.650 danger  now what  to  do  
00:58:43.686 about it. I mean, I've  been  
00:58:46.489 the biggest or the  one 
00:58:48.290 banging the drum  for the the 
00:58:49.025 hardest by  far the longest 
00:58:57.133 Or  this one of the longest 
00:58:57.734 for a high danger and or  
00:58:58.301 and these regulatory  things  
00:58:58.935 that  are happening 
00:58:59.402 are happening.  are happening 
00:59:00.036 the single  biggest reason  
00:59:00.636 that  happening is  because 
00:59:01.437 of  me  we  are ever going  
00:59:03.339 to get  their arms  around  
00:59:03.940 it. We  talked to the vice  
00:59:05.074 president this  afternoon.  
00:59:05.941 She said  she wants to  
00:59:06.776 regulate  it  people  
00:59:08.177 can try to regulate social  
00:59:09.045 media for years and have  
00:59:10.946 done  nothing effectively.  
00:59:13.149 Well, there's 
00:59:14.350 regulation around anything  
00:59:15.150 which is  a like  a physical  
00:59:17.086 danger  to a  danger to the 
00:59:18.288 public. So  like  cars  like  
00:59:19.288 So  to the public.  a danger  
00:59:19.922 to  danger  physical  a like  
00:59:20.556 is a  are heavily regulated.  
00:59:24.193 And Communications  and I 
00:59:24.760 have  And early regulated 
00:59:25.327 rockets and and aircraft  are 
00:59:25.961 heavily regulated the general 
00:59:28.664 philosophy  about regulation  
00:59:29.899 is  that  when something  is  
00:59:31.200 a danger  to  the public  
00:59:32.735 that  there needs to be some  
00:59:34.704 Governor  oversight?  So  
00:59:37.506 I think in my view  AI is 
00:59:40.342 more  dangerous than  nuclear 
00:59:42.044 bombs,  which we  regulate  
00:59:44.146 nuclear bombs.  You 
00:59:44.680 can't just  go  make  
00:59:45.448 a nuclear bomb  in your 
00:59:45.982 backyard. I think we  should  
00:59:49.251 have  some  kind of 
00:59:51.053 Regulation  with  a I now 
00:59:53.422 this  tense cause the AI  
00:59:56.559 acceleration is to  get up  
00:59:57.460 in arms because they  think 
00:59:59.628 I is  sort of having  
01:00:02.197 basically,  but 
01:00:04.567 you're typically  don't like  
01:00:05.201 don't typically but you're  
01:00:05.802 basically,  having  of  
01:00:06.335 is sort think I regulation. 
01:00:06.936 You've  pushed  back  on  
01:00:07.503 Regulators  for the 
01:00:08.437 most part in the  of  Of  
01:00:10.439 Tesla of  and with so many  
01:00:11.040 so  many  instances where we  
01:00:11.907 read  articles  about you 
01:00:12.808 pushing back  pushing you 
01:00:13.375 about articles  read  we  
01:00:13.942 where instances many  so  on  
01:00:14.576 The Regulators. 
01:00:14.977 I'm so curious. Why in this 
01:00:15.911 instance now  you own one 
01:00:16.612 of these  businesses. As  I 
01:00:19.148 said  a moment ago  as  As  
01:00:20.716 as  one should  not take  
01:00:25.888 what  is  viewed  in the  
01:00:27.122 media as  being the 
01:00:28.891 whole picture.  There are 
01:00:31.360 literally hundreds  like this 
01:00:33.496 is  probably  not an  
01:00:34.296 exaggeration. So  
01:00:35.264 they're probably  100 million 
01:00:37.399 regulations that  that  might 
01:00:40.102 companies comply  with  and 
01:00:41.504 they're probably  five that 
01:00:43.205 we  don't and if  they're if  
01:00:46.476 we  And disagree  with  and 
01:00:47.176 some of those regulations,  
01:00:47.977 it's  because we  think the 
01:00:49.278 regulation  that  is  meant 
01:00:50.479 to  do  good  doesn't 
01:00:51.881 actually  do  good. But that  
01:00:53.315 is  not the thing to  Flying  
01:00:54.917 regulations for the question  
01:00:55.885 if there  are laws  and 
01:00:56.886 rules.  Whether the 
01:01:01.523 ideas that you're making  the 
01:01:02.157 decision  that  the 
01:01:02.624 law and the whether the 
01:01:03.158 Whether the rule  
01:01:03.592 shouldn't be  the law on the  
01:01:04.226 rule  and then  right isn't 
01:01:05.361 that I'm saying 
01:01:06.662 follow my name is taken and 
01:01:07.263 and you should  be  obvious 
01:01:08.030 that  you're mistaken.  My  
01:01:09.765 company's Automotive  
01:01:12.568 is heavily  regulated.  We  
01:01:14.370 would not be  allowed to  put 
01:01:15.304 cars  on the  road. If we did 
01:01:16.172 not comply  with  this  
01:01:17.506 vast body of  Regulation. 
01:01:18.808 Now you could you could 
01:01:19.508 fill up the stage with  
01:01:21.977 literally,  you know, six 
01:01:24.213 foot  high  with  the 
01:01:26.582 regulations that  you have  
01:01:27.416 to  comply  with. To  make  a 
01:01:31.687 car and make  you could have  
01:01:33.689 a room  full of phone books.  
01:01:35.324 That's  how many  that's how  
01:01:36.225 big the regulations are and 
01:01:37.827 if  you don't comply  
01:01:38.661 with all  of  those you can't 
01:01:40.462 sell  the car and if  we  
01:01:41.897 don't comply  with  all the 
01:01:43.098 regulations for Rockets or  
01:01:44.567 for Starling  they  shot  us  
01:01:45.501 down. So  in fact,  I am  
01:01:48.637 incredibly  compliant with  
01:01:49.738 regulations now once  in  a 
01:01:51.273 while,  they'll be  something 
01:01:53.075 that I  disagree  with  the 
01:01:54.376 reason I  would disagree  
01:01:55.044 with  that. It's  because 
01:01:55.811 I think the regulation  in  
01:01:57.079 that  particular  case  
01:01:58.781 in that rare. Our case  
01:01:59.315 our case  does not  Our case  
01:01:59.949 serve the public  good  
01:02:00.583 our case  and therefore 
01:02:01.117 I think it is my  obligation  
01:02:03.052 to  object to 
01:02:04.520 a regulation that is meant to 
01:02:05.521 serve the public  good. 
01:02:06.522 If it doesn't that's the  
01:02:07.723 only  time  I object  not 
01:02:09.125 because I seek  to  object. 
01:02:11.060 In  fact, I'm incredibly  
01:02:13.062 rule-following. 
01:02:14.463 Let me ask you  a 
01:02:14.897 separate question is  social  
01:02:15.531 media related question. We've 
01:02:16.532 been talking  about 
01:02:17.299 Tick-Tock today ahead of  the 
01:02:19.201 election  sir.  Soccer's  
01:02:22.271 what  do you  think of  
01:02:23.005 tick-tock?  Do you  think 
01:02:23.806 it's a  national  security  
01:02:24.573 threat  I don't use like  
01:02:31.080 talk  it again. You don't 
01:02:33.616 I don't personally use  it. 
01:02:38.053 but for people  that  
01:02:40.422 for teenagers and people in 
01:02:43.125 their 20s,  they  seem  
01:02:44.126 almost  And and religiously 
01:02:44.927 And addicted  to  technology. 
01:02:48.330 So  we will watch 
01:02:50.733 Tech talk for like  2 hours 
01:02:51.834 a day.  I stopped using 
01:02:58.107 Tick-Tock when  I felt  the 
01:02:59.308 AI  probing my  mind  and I 
01:03:00.743 don't make  me uncomfortable. 
01:03:04.046 So  I stopped using it. 
01:03:11.820 And in terms  of  
01:03:12.354 anti-Semitic  content,  I 
01:03:13.155 mean  Tick Tock is  Rife with 
01:03:14.757 that. It has  the most  viral 
01:03:17.860 anti-semitic  content 
01:03:18.360 anti-semitic  most viral  
01:03:18.928 has the It  with that.  
01:03:19.462 Tick-Tock is Rife 
01:03:19.895 anti-semitic  content by  
01:03:20.463 far,  but you think the 
01:03:20.996 Chinese government  is  using 
01:03:21.630 it  to  manipulate. The 
01:03:24.166 minds of  Americans though. 
01:03:26.068 Is that something that  
01:03:26.936 you think we should 
01:03:27.403 worry about?  I mean  you 
01:03:29.038 have a  different states  
01:03:29.605 that  are trying  to  ban it. 
01:03:30.739 I don't think this  is  a 
01:03:32.041 sometimes going plot, but it  
01:03:36.312 is  The Tick Tock algorithm 
01:03:39.215 is entirely a high-powered. 
01:03:40.716 So  it  is  really  just  
01:03:43.986 try to find the most  viral 
01:03:44.787 thing possible  that  it's  
01:03:47.990 what is going to  keep  you 
01:03:48.791 glued to  the screen. That's  
01:03:49.958 screen. the to  glued you 
01:03:50.526 to keep is going  what  it's  
01:03:51.160 that  it  now the On  
01:03:55.498 sheer numbers.  There are on  
01:03:57.333 the order of  2 billion 
01:03:58.534 Muslims in the  world and 
01:03:59.435 I think You know  you know  
01:04:02.538 You know  much  you know  
01:04:03.472 smaller number  of  Jewish  
01:04:04.272 people  for 20 million  
01:04:06.475 something many  orders  
01:04:08.176 of magnitude  fewer.  So  if  
01:04:09.678 you just  look  at  at  
01:04:11.380 content production  just  
01:04:14.249 unsure  numbers basis is  
01:04:16.685 going to  be  overwhelmingly  
01:04:18.954 at Semitic. Let me  ask you 
01:04:20.856 about another the 
01:04:21.290 mess your political question  
01:04:23.192 and I've been trying  to  
01:04:24.059 square  this  one in my head  
01:04:24.860 for a long  time. Yeah  
01:04:26.428 in the  last  two or three  
01:04:28.230 years you have  moved 
01:04:31.333 decidedly to  the right I 
01:04:33.369 think have I  well we can 
01:04:34.837 discuss this. I think that  
01:04:37.673 you have  been  espousing and 
01:04:40.843 promoting a number  of  
01:04:44.480 Republican  candidates  and 
01:04:45.748 others  you've  been  very  
01:04:46.982 frustrated with the body  
01:04:48.083 Administration  over  I think 
01:04:49.385 unions  and feeling like  
01:04:52.488 they  did not respect what  
01:04:55.023 you've  created.  Well, I 
01:04:56.592 mean  with  without any 
01:05:00.496 during nothing  to  provoke 
01:05:01.163 the veteran administration, 
01:05:02.831 they  held  an  electric  
01:05:03.999 vehicle Summit  at the White  
01:05:04.633 House and specifically  
01:05:05.934 refused to  let Tesla 
01:05:08.704 and this  isn't the first 
01:05:09.271 And this  six months  of the  
01:05:09.905 and this  administration  
01:05:10.472 And this  and we  
01:05:11.874 inquiry like we literally 
01:05:12.908 make  more  electric  cars  
01:05:14.309 that  everyone else combined. 
01:05:14.943 Why are we  not allowed?  Why 
01:05:16.111 are you only  letting your  
01:05:17.212 84  GM  Chrysler  and UAW and 
01:05:21.950 you're specifically 
01:05:22.417 disallowing us  from  the EV  
01:05:23.319 Summit  at  the White House.  
01:05:25.721 We're done  nothing to  
01:05:26.255 provoke them  then  
01:05:29.024 Biden went  on  to  add 
01:05:29.758 insult  to injury and 
01:05:31.660 publicly  said  that  GM  was 
01:05:32.961 leading the electric car  
01:05:34.196 Evolution.  This  was in the  
01:05:35.564 same  quarter that  
01:05:36.965 Tesla made  300,000 
01:05:40.068 electric cars and GMA 26  
01:05:42.671 Does that seem  fair  to you? 
01:05:44.973 So  wierd Kappa tell me this  
01:05:46.075 then  it  doesn't seem  fair. 
01:05:49.078 And and I've  asked 
01:05:51.547 repeatedly  
01:05:51.980 you've probably seen  me  
01:05:52.714 but we had a  
01:05:53.081 great relationship  with  
01:05:53.682 Obama.  So  there's not a 
01:05:56.318 stupid  amount, but then  
01:05:57.419 there's other 
01:05:58.087 for a long. I stood certain 
01:05:58.787 hours for sick. I 
01:05:59.688 stood in line for six hours 
01:06:00.989 to  Shag  Obama's head. Okay, 
01:06:03.792 so  we just okay. So let me 
01:06:05.227 just ask on a personal level. 
01:06:06.095 me just ask on a personal 
01:06:06.662 so we just okay. So let Okay, 
01:06:07.296 head. I can see it  in your 
01:06:07.930 face  this  this  hurt  you 
01:06:09.565 personally. And I hope  
01:06:11.400 the company and to  And and 
01:06:12.201 it was  an insult to  
01:06:14.136 you know, did Tesla has 
01:06:17.106 140,000 employees?  Okay  of  
01:06:19.308 the employees.  it Tesla  
01:06:19.875 half  of them are in  
01:06:20.409 the United  States  tells us  
01:06:21.710 created 
01:06:22.411 more manufacturing jobs 
01:06:23.145 in everyone else  combined. 
01:06:27.015 So we asked this then you've  
01:06:28.316 devoted at  least the last  
01:06:30.619 close to  20 years  
01:06:31.286 your life.  If  not more  to  
01:06:33.622 the climate climate change  
01:06:35.991 trying  to  get Tesla off the 
01:06:37.426 ground  in  part  to improve  
01:06:38.627 climate.  You talked about  
01:06:39.528 that  a real  right-wing  
01:06:41.530 motive  repeatedly  got a 
01:06:44.766 far-right if  anything, I 
01:06:45.734 understand  that  and then  
01:06:47.536 it's  so  it's  a good  guys  
01:06:49.338 reverse psychology  Next  
01:06:50.772 Level.  Well, no, but so  
01:06:52.274 here's  
01:06:53.342 in the question, which  is  
01:06:53.943 how do  you square  the 
01:06:57.546 support that you have given,  
01:06:58.180 Support I believe you were  
01:06:58.781 at a  fundraiser  for the 
01:07:02.718 Vogue ramaswamy. For  
01:07:03.385 example,  who says  that  
01:07:06.088 the climate climate issue is  
01:07:07.690 a hoax, right?  
01:07:10.125 I disagree with him on that.  
01:07:11.727 I but I would think that  
01:07:12.527 that would  be  such  a 
01:07:13.328 singular  issue for you.  
01:07:15.130 I would think that  that  the 
01:07:16.131 climate issue be such a 
01:07:17.232 singular  issue for you that  
01:07:18.567 actually  it  would 
01:07:19.568 disqualify  almost  anybody 
01:07:21.737 who didn't  take  that  
01:07:22.738 issue seriously.  Well, 
01:07:25.240 I haven't endorsed  anyone  
01:07:25.841 for president.  I mean  I 
01:07:27.242 wanted  to hear what  
01:07:28.677 they had to say because 
01:07:30.312 I think some of his things  
01:07:31.947 are there some things he says 
01:07:33.182 I think are pretty  solid,  
01:07:35.951 you know  is  concerned about 
01:07:37.286 government  overreach 
01:07:39.087 but about gun control of  
01:07:39.888 information.  I mean  the 
01:07:42.291 degree to which old Twitter 
01:07:43.892 was basically a sock  puppet  
01:07:45.627 of  the government  was 
01:07:47.329 ridiculous. So, you know, 
01:07:50.632 it seems  to me that  
01:07:51.200 me that the seems to  it  
01:07:51.767 know, you So, ridiculous. was 
01:07:52.401 the there's a very  severe  
01:07:54.436 violation of  the amendment 
01:07:56.539 in  terms of  how much  
01:07:57.072 the government  control 
01:07:58.340 how much  control the 
01:07:58.974 government  had overall 
01:07:59.975 Twitter and it  no longer is  
01:08:03.679 so, you know, there's 
01:08:04.814 a reason  for the First 
01:08:05.781 Amendment.  The reason  
01:08:07.182 for the First Amendment for 
01:08:08.817 freedom of speech is because  
01:08:10.519 the people  that  immigrated  
01:08:11.586 to this country came  from  
01:08:13.021 a place is  where there was 
01:08:14.456 not reading of  speech  and 
01:08:16.625 and they were like, you know  
01:08:17.259 what  we  got to make sure  
01:08:19.228 that  that's  constitutional  
01:08:21.430 because where they  came  
01:08:22.464 from  if they said  something 
01:08:24.433 that we put 
01:08:31.139 Resume whether it be, 
01:08:31.639 you know, something 
01:08:32.107 bad would happen  to him. So  
01:08:32.741 and freedom of  speech  
01:08:33.274 you have to say,  when  is  
01:08:33.875 it  relevant? It's  only  
01:08:34.442 relevant  when  when  someone 
01:08:36.678 you don't like  can say 
01:08:38.046 something you don't like  or  
01:08:39.982 it  has it  or  like  don't 
01:08:40.782 you something say can like  
01:08:41.383 don't you has no  meaning and 
01:08:43.585 as  soon  as  you sort  of  
01:08:46.488 You know  throw in  the towel 
01:08:48.724 and can see to censorship.  
01:08:50.524 It  is  only  a matter  of  
01:08:51.292 time  before  someone sensors 
01:08:53.662 you and that  is  why we  
01:08:55.564 have the  First Amendment.  
01:08:58.267 Could you see yourself  
01:08:59.100 voting  for President Biden 
01:09:01.103 if  it's  if they Biden Trump 
01:09:03.171 election, for example I think 
01:09:10.412 I would not vote  for 
01:09:11.380 vitamin.  You vote for  
01:09:12.448 Trump.  Let s vote  
01:09:14.282 for Trump, but I mean This  
01:09:18.487 is  this is definitely  a 
01:09:19.921 difficult Choice  here. 
01:09:21.156 You know, we  would you 
01:09:22.991 or would you  vote  for 
01:09:24.192 Nikki Haley Nikki Haley,  by  
01:09:24.826 the way,  once  Haley all 
01:09:26.328 social  media names to  be  
01:09:30.399 exposed as  you know, no, I 
01:09:31.299 think that's  outrageous. 
01:09:33.035 Yeah. No. No, I'm not 
01:09:34.836 going to  vote  for some pros 
01:09:35.671 and censorship. Canada  that. 
01:09:38.140 like  Canada  and censorship  
01:09:38.774 pros  some  vote for  to  
01:09:39.341 going I'm not 
01:09:39.707 like that. I mean, I think  
01:09:40.341 these you have to you have to 
01:09:43.377 consider  that  there is  
01:09:44.179 a lot of  wisdom  in  these 
01:09:47.115 amendments, Consider  
01:09:48.350 you know, I mean  the 
01:09:49.184 Constitution  and and you 
01:09:52.787 know, a lot of  these 
01:09:53.721 a lot of things 
01:09:54.323 that we take for  granted 
01:09:55.023 here  in  the United States 
01:09:57.426 that don't  even  exist in  
01:09:58.260 Canada. There's not enough  
01:10:01.530 constitutional  
01:10:02.731 right to freedom  of  speech  
01:10:03.365 and Canada. So, you know, 
01:10:06.768 so and  there's no  
01:10:07.569 Miranda rights  in Canada 
01:10:08.870 people like think like, you 
01:10:09.471 know, you have  the right to  
01:10:10.272 remain  silent. You don't 
01:10:11.106 actually  in Canada.  So  so  
01:10:15.377 you don't have Canadian I So  
01:10:16.011 can save you some coffee, but 
01:10:19.314 you know, so  like you just 
01:10:21.016 got you the 
01:10:22.751 say these things about  
01:10:23.285 freedom of  speech  is  
01:10:25.253 incredibly important. Even  
01:10:28.890 when  people  said  and I 
01:10:29.925 like  that  because it's  a 
01:10:31.259 it's  actually  especially  
01:10:32.661 important.  In  fact, it  is  
01:10:33.561 only  relevant  when  people  
01:10:36.698 you don't like  can say 
01:10:37.866 things  you don't like  and 
01:10:39.401 do you  think right now 
01:10:40.869 as they're meaningless  you 
01:10:41.470 think right now the 
01:10:42.871 Republican  candidates  for 
01:10:43.472 the Democrats are more  
01:10:45.707 inclined. I mean, this  is  
01:10:46.608 where you go  to  I assume to 
01:10:49.010 to  woke an anti  woke  
01:10:49.878 an anti woke  assume 22 woke  
01:10:50.679 and the mind  Virus issue 
01:10:51.913 that  you've  talked about. 
01:10:54.850 Which party do you  think is  
01:10:55.584 is  more  Pro freedom of  
01:10:58.186 speech  given all the things  
01:10:59.121 you've  seen  is. We  also  
01:11:00.222 see,  you know, DeSantis, 
01:11:03.258 you know, preventing  people  
01:11:04.492 from  Reading certain things. 
01:11:05.527 Maybe you but maybe you think 
01:11:06.361 that's  that's  that's  
01:11:07.362 correct.  No, look  
01:11:12.534 we actually are in  an  odd 
01:11:13.335 situation here  where on  
01:11:16.438 balance the Democrats appear  
01:11:18.540 to  be  more  Pro Spencer 
01:11:21.343 censorship  than  the 
01:11:23.078 Republicans.  That  
01:11:23.811 used to be  the opposite  
01:11:24.813 it used to be,  you know, 
01:11:26.848 that  left  position  was 
01:11:28.116 freedom of speech.  You know, 
01:11:32.421 I believe at one point  the 
01:11:35.624 ACL u-- even  defended  the 
01:11:37.526 right of  someone to claim  
01:11:38.794 that  they were not see or  
01:11:39.661 something like  that, 
01:11:40.162 you know, so  like  they  
01:11:42.364 weren't there really  were  
01:11:43.665 like  the left  was 
01:11:45.867 three of us peaches is  
01:11:46.668 fundamental and I mean  my  
01:11:50.772 deception Perhaps it is 
01:11:51.607 inaccurate  is that The 
01:11:57.212 pro censorship  is  more  
01:11:57.779 on the  left than the right.  
01:12:00.615 We  certainly get more  
01:12:01.383 complaints from the left  
01:12:02.083 and the right 
01:12:02.617 because that way  so  but my  
01:12:08.523 aspiration  for the X 
01:12:09.791 platform  is  that  it  is  
01:12:10.792 the best  source of Truth 
01:12:12.627 or the least  
01:12:13.295 in accurate source  of  
01:12:13.829 Truth.  Truth and well, And 
01:12:15.764 Truth.  you know, I don't 
01:12:16.631 know  you won't believe me  
01:12:18.133 or not, but I think but I 
01:12:19.601 not,  me or believe you won't 
01:12:20.235 know  don't I know, well, you 
01:12:20.869 Honesty is the  best  policy  
01:12:21.503 and I think that  
01:12:23.605 the truth will win. 
01:12:24.573 In overtime and the 
01:12:25.407 in overtime you know, we've 
01:12:26.241 In overtime got this  this  
01:12:27.142 great system  and 
01:12:28.677 it's getting better called  
01:12:29.578 Community notes,  which is  
01:12:31.780 fantastic.  I think it  
01:12:32.981 correcting  falsehoods  or  
01:12:35.550 adding  context.  In  fact, 
01:12:37.085 we  make  a point of  not 
01:12:39.788 removing  anything  but only  
01:12:41.156 adding  context now that  
01:12:42.791 context could could include 
01:12:44.292 this  is  completely  false 
01:12:45.393 and here's  why and and and 
01:12:48.196 no  one is  immune  to  this. 
01:12:49.397 I'm not immune  to  it  
01:12:50.665 advertisers it  to  immune  
01:12:51.266 not I'm this. to  is immune 
01:12:51.866 one no  advertisers not 
01:12:52.400 immune  to  it. In fact,  
01:12:53.502 we've had community.  Notes,  
01:12:56.038 which is  caused  us  some  
01:12:56.738 loss in advertising 
01:12:57.439 speaking of lost  some  
01:12:58.240 advertising Revenue.  We're 
01:13:01.076 for Community note, if  
01:13:03.078 an app if this  false 
01:13:04.379 advertising the community 
01:13:05.480 note  will  say this  is  
01:13:07.382 false and here  is  why 
01:13:10.385 let me  like  there's one 
01:13:12.487 specific  example that  is  
01:13:13.722 public knowledge. So  
01:13:14.222 I'll mention  it  which is  
01:13:15.690 one point Uber  had it, it  
01:13:17.526 this ad which said  
01:13:19.294 earn like a boss  and it  was 
01:13:21.396 Community noted if  by boss 
01:13:22.697 if by noted Community was it  
01:13:23.331 and boss  said earn like a  
01:13:23.932 which ad  boss  you mean  
01:13:28.003 And 47  cents an hour this  
01:13:29.437 distant cause at least  
01:13:29.971 a temporary suspension  of  
01:13:30.939 advertising from  Aruba.  I 
01:13:32.140 got to ask  you a question  
01:13:32.908 that  might make  
01:13:33.642 everybody in  the room  
01:13:34.809 comfortable or not  
01:13:35.276 uncomfortable and it goes 
01:13:36.011 to the  Free  Speech  issue 
01:13:37.712 the New York  Times company 
01:13:38.713 and the New York  Times 
01:13:40.081 newspaper it  appeared  
01:13:41.449 over the  summer  to be 
01:13:43.852 throttled.  What  did the New 
01:13:46.154 York  Times?  Well, we're do  
01:13:48.356 require that  that  everyone  
01:13:51.526 has to  buy a subscription  
01:13:53.562 that we don't.  Make  make  
01:13:54.163 exceptions  for Make  make  
01:13:54.763 anyone  and and I think if  I 
01:13:57.198 want the New York Times I 
01:13:57.765 have  to  pay for 
01:13:58.366 a subscription  and they  
01:13:59.934 don't give  me  a free  
01:14:00.635 subscription. So  I'm not 
01:14:02.770 going to  give  them  a free  
01:14:03.538 subscription. But were you  
01:14:04.406 what  were you  throttling  
01:14:05.740 the New York  Times relative  
01:14:06.975 to  other news  organizations 
01:14:08.310 relative  to  everybody else  
01:14:09.611 was it  was it  was it  
01:14:10.912 specific to the to the  times 
01:14:12.647 that  it  applies of  Griffin 
01:14:16.184 by the only cost like 
01:14:16.684 a thousand dollars  a month.  
01:14:17.318 So  if  they  just do that  
01:14:19.187 then  then  they  the back  
01:14:22.257 in back in the  saddle, but 
01:14:23.525 but but you are saying  that  
01:14:25.260 it  was throttled now I'm 
01:14:26.962 saying  I mean was there  a 
01:14:29.030 conversation that you had?  
01:14:29.631 Is somebody you said  look, 
01:14:30.231 is somebody you 
01:14:30.632 Is somebody you you know, I'm 
01:14:31.866 unhappy with the  
01:14:32.434 is somebody you times they  
01:14:33.035 should  either  be  buying  
01:14:34.202 the subscription  where I 
01:14:34.869 don't like  their content or  
01:14:35.971 whatever  any organization  
01:14:39.141 that  refuses to  buy 
01:14:40.375 a subscription  is  is  not 
01:14:43.311 going to  be  recommended.  
01:14:45.981 But then  what  does that say 
01:14:47.015 about free? Speech  and what  
01:14:49.517 does it say about the 
01:14:50.752 amplifying  we  
01:14:52.787 search for it cost a little 
01:14:53.388 bit right but That's  it. But 
01:14:57.158 that's  an  interesting.  
01:14:58.393 Yeah, it's  like  an  
01:15:01.329 South Park  might I say,  
01:15:03.365 you know  Freedom isn't free  
01:15:04.799 of cost a buck  05  or  
01:15:06.134 whatever. So  but it's pretty 
01:15:08.637 cheap.  Okay, it's  So, low 
01:15:11.372 cost  So  So, low cost  
01:15:12.874 freedom.  I got a couple  
01:15:13.508 more  questions for you.  
01:15:15.510 You're headed back  to  Texas 
01:15:16.811 after this. We're 
01:15:18.613 going to launch 
01:15:19.714 the stopper truck.  Yeah. 
01:15:21.016 It's  going to  be a  big 
01:15:21.783 launch, but I wanted  to ask  
01:15:23.718 you right now more  broadly 
01:15:26.254 just about  the car business  
01:15:27.322 The the The and what you  see 
01:15:28.456 actually  happening and 
01:15:31.159 specifically  the government  
01:15:32.961 put in  place lots of 
01:15:34.362 policies  as you know to  try 
01:15:35.163 to  encourage more  Evie's  
01:15:37.599 and one of the  things  
01:15:38.366 that's  happened  uniquely  
01:15:39.901 is  you have  now a lot of  
01:15:41.069 car companies saying  
01:15:42.937 actually  this  is  too 
01:15:44.506 ambitious for us. These plans 
01:15:45.573 are too ambitious for 
01:15:46.474 thousand  dealers.  I don't 
01:15:47.175 if you saw  just  yesterday 
01:15:48.576 sent  a letter to the White 
01:15:49.177 House saying  this  
01:15:50.645 has gone too far. You're  
01:15:51.980 going too far you had far you 
01:15:53.348 too going 
01:15:53.648 gone too far. You're  has 
01:15:54.215 this  saying  had this  
01:15:54.749 on TV.  It was  a it was  
01:15:58.320 this  It was  is  going 
01:15:58.854 too fast  it was  too far and 
01:15:59.488 that  there's not enough  
01:16:00.889 demand  are underneath  all 
01:16:03.391 this  is  his idea  
01:16:04.192 that maybe  there's not 
01:16:04.793 enough  demand  for Evie's  
01:16:06.594 that the American public  has 
01:16:07.495 not bought  into  the I mean  
01:16:08.930 they bought into  with  with  
01:16:10.131 your  company,  but they  
01:16:11.332 haven't bought  into  
01:16:12.333 it broadly  enough. 
01:16:13.635 Well, I think if you  make  a 
01:16:14.636 compelling  electric  
01:16:15.637 car, if you will  buy it  
01:16:16.438 no question about it. I mean  
01:16:18.840 electric  car sales in China  
01:16:19.641 are gigantic. gigantic  
01:16:21.543 that's  by far the biggest  
01:16:23.078 category  biggest 
01:16:23.578 that's by far the gigantic  
01:16:24.179 are China sales in  car and I 
01:16:25.180 think that  
01:16:26.014 would be the case.  No, 
01:16:28.583 I mean  it's  worth noting. 
01:16:29.818 Okay. So  the probably the  
01:16:31.153 best  reputation  of  that  
01:16:32.420 is  that  the so  Okay, 
01:16:33.922 Tesla Model y will be the 
01:16:35.223 best  selling car of  any 
01:16:37.225 kind  on Earth  this  year. 
01:16:41.830 Of  any kind  gasoline  or  
01:16:42.431 gasoline  of  otherwise,  is  
01:16:43.565 there another car company 
01:16:45.266 that you  
01:16:46.201 think is doing a good job 
01:16:47.102 with these? I mean, I think 
01:16:49.370 the Chinese called  companies 
01:16:50.338 are extremely competitive by  
01:16:52.373 far our toughest  
01:16:53.308 competitions in China.  So, 
01:16:57.278 I mean  there's there's a lot 
01:16:59.080 of  people  who are out there 
01:17:02.417 think that  the top ten car 
01:17:03.885 company is going to be  Tesla 
01:17:04.719 followed by nine  Chinese 
01:17:05.787 companies.  I think 
01:17:07.222 they might  not be  wrong.  
01:17:09.023 So  China is  So  wrong.  be  
01:17:12.060 not might they  I think 
01:17:12.594 companies.  car Chinese nine  
01:17:13.228 super good  at  manufacturing 
01:17:13.862 and the work  ethic is  
01:17:14.629 incredible. So  you know, 
01:17:19.434 like  You if  we  consider  
01:17:20.602 different leagues of  you 
01:17:21.369 competitiveness at  Tesla,  
01:17:23.238 we  consider  the Chinese 
01:17:24.639 League to be  the most  
01:17:25.406 competitive.  And by  
01:17:27.041 the way,  we  do  very well 
01:17:27.842 in  China because are 
01:17:30.078 trying to China team  is  the 
01:17:30.712 best  
01:17:31.746 China how worried are you 
01:17:32.313 that  the 
01:17:33.948 union has unionization  
01:17:34.482 effort  that  just  
01:17:34.949 took place  at  what  
01:17:38.253 I should  say effort. But but 
01:17:39.187 effort, the the new the new 
01:17:41.022 wages in the like at GM and 
01:17:43.158 Ford  are that  they're 
01:17:44.626 coming  for you.  They  are 
01:17:47.028 coming  for you.  What  
01:17:48.163 is that going to  mean  to  
01:17:48.764 you and your  business? Well, 
01:17:51.065 I mean, I think it's  
01:17:51.933 generally not good  to  have  
01:17:53.668 an  adversarial relationship  
01:17:55.970 between people  online, 
01:17:59.073 you know  one group at the  
01:18:00.942 company and another group.  
01:18:01.710 In  fact, I mean  I disagree  
01:18:04.612 with  the idea of unions, 
01:18:07.015 but the professor mean, I 
01:18:07.582 reason that is  different 
01:18:08.149 than  you may expect  
01:18:09.417 is which  I just  don't like  
01:18:13.121 anything  which creates 
01:18:13.655 kind of Lords and peasants  
01:18:14.255 sort  of  thing.  And I think 
01:18:14.889 the Union's naturally try to  
01:18:16.758 create. Negativity  in a  
01:18:19.360 company negativity  
01:18:19.827 Negativity  and and create a  
01:18:21.563 sort of Lords and peasants  
01:18:23.731 situation.  There are many  
01:18:25.567 people  at  Tesla who have  
01:18:26.968 come  and gone  from  
01:18:28.369 working on  the line  to  
01:18:29.604 being in  Senior Management.  
01:18:30.705 There is  no  laws  and 
01:18:32.373 peasants. Everyone  eats  the 
01:18:33.341 same  table or approximate  
01:18:35.543 a parking lot,  you know  GM  
01:18:37.078 there's a special elevator  
01:18:38.379 for only  for senior  
01:18:39.981 Executives. We  have no such  
01:18:41.516 thing at  Tesla,  you know, 
01:18:44.652 at Tesla, thing such  no  
01:18:45.219 Executives. We have senior  
01:18:45.820 for only  the things that I 
01:18:46.454 actually  know  the people  
01:18:47.222 on the  line  because I 
01:18:48.523 worked  on  the line  and I 
01:18:49.824 walked  the line  and I slept 
01:18:51.326 in the  factory and I 
01:18:52.827 worked beside them. So  
01:18:57.031 I'm no stranger to  them  and 
01:19:01.736 they're actually  many  
01:19:02.470 times.  I've said well  
01:19:04.172 can't we  just  hold  a union 
01:19:05.473 vote  but apparently  a 
01:19:06.674 company is not  allowed to  
01:19:07.308 hold  a union vote. So  it  
01:19:09.277 has to  be  somehow cool  for 
01:19:10.878 but the union can't do  it. 
01:19:12.513 So  I said we'll just have  
01:19:14.315 to hold a vote  and see what  
01:19:15.016 happens the actual  problem.  
01:19:19.120 It is the is  as the  
01:19:20.688 opposite. It's  not that  
01:19:21.255 people  trapped are people  
01:19:21.957 that  not opposite. It's  the 
01:19:22.591 as  the is  is  problem 
01:19:23.124 are trapped at  Tesla 
01:19:23.625 building cars the trip. The 
01:19:26.928 challenges  is  how do we 
01:19:27.495 retain? Great people  to do 
01:19:30.098 the hard work of  building  
01:19:31.299 cars  when they have  like  
01:19:33.101 six other opportunities that  
01:19:34.302 they  can do  that  are 
01:19:35.169 easier. That's the  actual  
01:19:37.005 difficulty  is  that  
01:19:38.806 bullying  cars  is  hard  
01:19:39.407 work  and and there are much  
01:19:41.776 easier  jobs  and I just  
01:19:43.578 want to say that  
01:19:45.046 I'm incredibly  appreciative  
01:19:46.447 of  those who have  cars  and 
01:19:48.249 they  know  it, you know, so  
01:19:54.188 there's There's there's 
01:19:55.056 There's I don't know. Maybe 
01:19:55.890 there will be 
01:19:56.691 your be nice. If  I said  
01:19:57.958 like  if  Tesla gets your 
01:19:59.394 nights will be  because we  
01:20:00.028 deserve it  and we  fell  in  
01:20:00.995 some  way,  but 
01:20:05.133 we certainly try  hard  to  
01:20:07.201 way ensure  the prosperity  
01:20:08.536 of  everyone. We  give  
01:20:09.637 everyone  stock options.  
01:20:12.206 made  We've options.  stock 
01:20:12.807 everyone  give  We  everyone. 
01:20:13.441 of  prosperity  We've made  
01:20:14.041 many  people  who are just  
01:20:16.277 working the line. 
01:20:17.779 Who didn't even know what 
01:20:18.346 stocks  were  we made the 
01:20:18.913 millionaires. So  we're 
01:20:21.582 going to  run on  time  
01:20:22.684 final couple  quick 
01:20:23.284 questions.  When  do you have 
01:20:25.453 the time? To  tweet or  
01:20:29.290 the post. I actually think  
01:20:31.959 about all the time  as  
01:20:32.694 I said, I used it bathroom. 
01:20:34.295 Sometimes I use it  all the 
01:20:36.230 time  meaning if  we  were  
01:20:37.998 to  if we were  to  open  
01:20:39.067 up our  phones  and look at 
01:20:40.101 the screen  time. What  
01:20:41.903 does yours look like? Well  
01:20:45.306 about every three hours I 
01:20:47.809 make  a trip to the lavatory  
01:20:50.611 and that's the only time  you 
01:20:51.245 do  this  seems like  
01:20:52.313 you're on there a lot.  
01:20:58.519 No, I mean I  did they'll be  
01:21:00.555 like  brief moments between 
01:21:02.523 meetings. I mean, it's  not 
01:21:07.161 obviously I've  had like  17  
01:21:08.663 jobs  so, you know  so  so, 
01:21:11.165 and so  no no,  I guess 
01:21:13.468 technically it's  work  this  
01:21:15.103 point it is but I'm thinking  
01:21:17.004 just in terms of  your  mind  
01:21:18.106 sharing.  I mean, by  the 
01:21:18.906 way,  there's a lot of  
01:21:19.507 people  who should be working 
01:21:20.608 who are who are on this app 
01:21:22.310 technically posting on  
01:21:22.944 Twitter is  0 or X  is  work  
01:21:25.246 it  does count  as work.  So  
01:21:26.447 that's  you know, there's 
01:21:28.249 that  but no, I mean, I think 
01:21:32.553 I'm on. Well, I guess well, 
01:21:36.257 usually probably  Well, 
01:21:36.791 I'm on  well, for longer  
01:21:37.358 than  I think I 
01:21:39.127 know what I know but you think
01:21:39.761 that  you have a day for  
01:21:41.029 the screen  time  of  like  
01:21:42.063 number  of hours per week.  
01:21:43.664 It's  another that's  a scary 
01:21:44.499 number. It's  probably  
01:21:47.702 number hours per week.  
01:21:48.236 I don't know. It's a little 
01:21:48.836 over  an hour a day or  
01:21:49.570 something like  that. Just  
01:21:50.905 an hour a day.  If  we  
01:21:53.541 really  looked at this  
01:21:54.542 together, do you have 
01:21:55.109 your phone  with  you?  Yeah, 
01:21:57.311 you want to look? Okay. Okay, 
01:22:02.784 here we go. You're ready  
01:22:05.320 screen  time  in general  
01:22:07.188 in time.  in time?  You ready 
01:22:08.923 time? Sometimes.  It's  
01:22:09.624 a scary number. I know  
01:22:10.992 that's  why I thought I just  
01:22:23.170 got a new phone.  So  I think 
01:22:24.105 this is not accurate  because 
01:22:25.306 I'm a it's  one minute  
01:22:28.309 minute for  one it's  
01:22:28.809 for sure. It's  more than 
01:22:29.377 that. Alright, it's over  the 
01:22:30.211 week. Either  
01:22:32.280 go. Yeah, go girl go to the 
01:22:32.881 week. Okay, so  it's  
01:22:35.283 so wrong. It's  more than 
01:22:36.217 four  minutes.  I just  got 
01:22:39.020 a new phone. So this  is  not 
01:22:40.021 accurate. 
01:22:42.190 The police are four minutes 
01:22:42.791 new phone.  Tim.  Cook's  
01:22:43.757 end of the phone  if  
01:22:44.959 new phone who does  you know, 
01:22:47.462 I should  
01:22:48.062 ask by the way because  I 
01:22:48.629 just  mentioned Tim Cook. 
01:22:49.730 Do you  feel  like you're 
01:22:50.297 going to  have  to  have  a 
01:22:51.099 battle  with  him eventually, 
01:22:52.266 is  that  the next  fight?  
01:22:54.569 I mean, I'd over  the App 
01:22:55.270 Store the idea  of  making  a 
01:22:56.871 phone call. You mean  like  
01:22:58.573 no. No  so  of  the App Store 
01:23:01.876 value make a phone. Sam 
01:23:03.010 Altman  is apparently I'm 
01:23:03.577 thinking  about making  
01:23:04.111 a phone with  Johnny  Ive.  
01:23:05.513 I mean, I don't think there's 
01:23:07.148 a real  need  to  make  
01:23:07.815 a phone maybe if  those are 
01:23:12.053 essential needs 
01:23:12.854 megaphone or make it  fun,  
01:23:13.455 but I got a lot of  fish  
01:23:15.056 to fry. So  I mean  I do  
01:23:18.960 think there's a 
01:23:19.894 there's a there's a 
01:23:20.361 fundamental challenge that  
01:23:21.129 phone makers  have  at this 
01:23:21.863 point because you've  got 
01:23:23.264 basically got you've  because 
01:23:23.898 this point  at  have  makers  
01:23:24.532 phone that  basically a black 
01:23:25.166 rectangle.  You know, how do  
01:23:28.870 you make  that  better? 
01:23:31.439 So you  want to do  that? 
01:23:32.040 What  does that was that  
01:23:32.740 look  like  in  elon's  head? 
01:23:36.244 So  that's  literally 
01:23:37.945 yes. Good good  phrase  
01:23:39.213 in the  head  
01:23:40.648 neurolink. Well,  
01:23:42.049 there we go.  That  way we  
01:23:44.218 need times before it's over.  
01:23:45.553 You know, the best  interface 
01:23:47.155 would be  a neural interface  
01:23:48.456 directly  to  your brain  so  
01:23:50.725 that  they'll be in 
01:23:51.459 your life.  How far we do you 
01:23:52.360 think from  that  and how 
01:23:53.861 excited or  scary does  that  
01:23:55.263 seem  to be and we  read  
01:23:56.264 these headlines obviously 
01:23:57.532 about a monkey's who died as  
01:23:59.367 you know, what  
01:24:00.768 should we think about that? 
01:24:03.404 Yeah, actually  the this is 
01:24:07.808 yeah, Yeah, the USDA  
01:24:09.243 inspector yeah, who came  by  
01:24:11.646 neural link facilities  
01:24:13.047 literally said  in  said  
01:24:13.648 literally 
01:24:13.948 neurolink facilities  in her  
01:24:14.582 entire  career. She has never 
01:24:15.249 seen  a better  Animal  Care  
01:24:19.153 Facility. it  is  It  we are  
01:24:19.787 it  the It  nicest  channels  
01:24:21.322 that  you could possibly  be  
01:24:22.990 even  to the  rats  and mice  
01:24:24.325 even  though  they  did the 
01:24:25.059 plague  and everything. So  
01:24:30.164 it  is  it  is  like  monkey  
01:24:31.832 Paradise. So  the thing 
01:24:37.138 that's  gets  conflated is  
01:24:38.239 that  there were  some  
01:24:39.574 terminal  monkeys where you 
01:24:41.175 know, this  is  like  this  
01:24:41.975 is actually several years ago 
01:24:43.377 where the monkeys were  about 
01:24:44.845 to  die 
01:24:46.280 and I'm like, okay, we've got 
01:24:46.914 an  experimental  device. 
01:24:47.481 It's  
01:24:49.016 so kind of thing, which only  
01:24:52.920 On a monkey that's about  
01:24:53.487 today.  And then  you know  
01:24:54.088 now the monkey died but 
01:24:54.622 didn't  die because the 
01:24:55.156 neural link died  because 
01:24:55.723 it was, you know  
01:24:56.157 had a terminal case of  
01:24:56.690 cancer or something like  
01:24:57.258 that. So  you're like it has  
01:25:02.630 never caused the death  of  a 
01:25:04.098 monkey  Sylvester.  
01:25:05.833 I'm unless  they're hiding  
01:25:06.734 something for me  is  is  
01:25:08.469 never caused death of monkey. 
01:25:09.570 And in fact,  we've not had 
01:25:11.672 monkeys with  neural  
01:25:13.074 implants  for 23 years  and 
01:25:15.843 they're doing great.  So  And 
01:25:20.414 we've even  replaced  the 
01:25:21.582 dinner like twice.  It's  and 
01:25:23.784 we're getting ready to  do  
01:25:24.518 the the first it's  
01:25:26.087 dinner like twice It's  
01:25:26.621 dinner like twice.  it's  
01:25:27.188 dinner like twice implants  
01:25:27.789 and hopefully in a few  
01:25:28.323 months  the they're only  
01:25:32.393 implementations 
01:25:33.261 of neural link. I think are 
01:25:33.862 unequivocally good  speaking  
01:25:34.529 of  the double-edged  sword.  
01:25:35.463 I think these early 
01:25:36.564 implementations are 
01:25:37.164 single edged  sword because 
01:25:38.599 the first implementations 
01:25:40.067 will  be  to  enable  people  
01:25:41.802 who are have  rushed  the 
01:25:43.604 brain-body connection to  be  
01:25:46.407 able  to  operate a computer  
01:25:47.308 or  phone faster than someone 
01:25:48.643 who has hands.  That  work  
01:25:51.579 so you  can imagine if  
01:25:52.113 Stephen Hawking could that  
01:25:53.080 communicate faster  than  
01:25:54.181 someone who had for body  
01:25:57.084 functionality Now Incredible  
01:25:58.319 that  would be  well  that's  
01:25:59.320 what  this  device  will  do  
01:26:01.989 and we should have  
01:26:03.491 a proof of that in a  human 
01:26:05.293 hopefully in  a few months  
01:26:07.328 it already  Works in  monkeys 
01:26:09.130 worked  quite well  with  
01:26:11.599 monkeys that  can play  
01:26:13.634 video games just  using just  
01:26:14.735 by  thinking  so  then the  
01:26:17.805 next  application after the 
01:26:21.609 the sort of those,  you know  
01:26:22.677 dealing with  The the 
01:26:23.745 tetraplegic some  The quite a 
01:26:24.979 really  quite a few tricks  
01:26:26.380 is  going to  be  Vision  
01:26:29.083 vision  is  the 
01:26:30.284 the next thing so it's  like  
01:26:30.918 if  somebody  is  like  has 
01:26:35.489 lost  both  eyes  or  
01:26:37.792 the optic nerve has failed  
01:26:39.093 basically where there's 
01:26:40.528 Basically failed. they have 
01:26:41.129 no  possibility basically 
01:26:41.729 failed  of  Basically failed. 
01:26:42.363 having  sort  of  some  
01:26:43.497 ocular  correction  that  
01:26:45.299 that  would be  the next  
01:26:46.100 thing of  when your 
01:26:48.969 link is a direct vision.  
01:26:49.904 face  and in fact,  then you  
01:26:50.538 Face  could be  like  Face, 
01:26:51.139 face, Geordi  laforge from  
01:26:51.839 Star Trek you could you could 
01:26:53.007 see in  like  any frequency 
01:26:54.508 actually  could see in  radar 
01:26:56.410 if you  want  to  final 
01:26:58.045 questions and then  we're 
01:26:59.146 going to  do  in this 
01:27:00.247 conversation, which I think 
01:27:01.449 has taken everybody Inside  
01:27:02.650 the Mind  of  Elon  Musk  
01:27:03.951 today.  Not as  well  as  the 
01:27:05.653 neural link below.  
01:27:06.320 neural link below 
01:27:11.959 it actually goes  to  
01:27:12.693 self-driving  
01:27:13.060 It actually goes  
01:27:13.494 neural link below.  cars  and 
01:27:14.128 vision  and everything  else  
01:27:15.796 everything  and vision  and 
01:27:16.397 cars  driving self  
01:27:16.864 it actually goes  and I 
01:27:17.398 asked this  question of 
01:27:17.931 people  to  judge 
01:27:18.999 Transportation secretary. 
01:27:20.901 Three it's  actually  
01:27:21.401 something you retweeted.  So  
01:27:22.035 I wanted  to ask  you 
01:27:22.536 the same  question. 
01:27:24.038 There's a big question  about 
01:27:25.439 autonomous  vehicles  and the 
01:27:28.008 safety of them. But there's 
01:27:29.443 also  a question  about when  
01:27:32.646 will  be  politically 
01:27:33.447 palatable in  this  country 
01:27:36.317 for.  people  to die  in  
01:27:41.989 cars  that  That  that  
01:27:44.425 are controlled by computers,  
01:27:45.493 which is  say That  we  have  
01:27:46.694 35  40  thousand  deaths  
01:27:48.529 every year  in this in  this  
01:27:49.730 country.  Yeah, if  you could 
01:27:50.931 bring that  number  down  to  
01:27:53.200 10,000 5,000. That  might be  
01:27:55.603 a great thing.  But do  we  
01:27:56.637 think that  the country will  
01:28:00.007 accept  the idea that 5,000 
01:28:01.542 people  that  your  family  
01:28:03.944 might have  perished  in  a 
01:28:06.914 vehicle as  a result  not of  
01:28:09.250 human making  a mistake but 
01:28:10.718 of  a computer. Yes.  Well, 
01:28:14.054 first of all  humans  are 
01:28:14.655 terrible  drivers,  so  
01:28:16.857 people  text and  drive 
01:28:18.125 the drink and drive they  get 
01:28:19.960 into  arguments they  you 
01:28:21.896 know  Do all  sorts of  
01:28:26.667 things in cars  that  they  
01:28:27.735 should  not do. So  so  So  
01:28:32.606 it's  actually  remarkable  
01:28:33.507 that  there are not more  so  
01:28:34.308 deaths  than  there are what  
01:28:37.611 will find with  computer  
01:28:39.313 driving is  I think probably  
01:28:40.614 an order of magnitude 
01:28:41.415 reduction in  deaths. I think 
01:28:44.919 now and the US  has actually  
01:28:47.455 far fewer deaths per capita 
01:28:48.655 than  the rest  of the  world 
01:28:49.390 world.  If you  go  if you  
01:28:50.357 world If you  world.  
01:28:51.358 worldwide,  I think there's 
01:28:52.292 something close to  a million 
01:28:53.461 deaths  per year  due to  
01:28:56.063 Automotive  accidents.  So  
01:28:59.099 I think computer  
01:29:02.570 after driving will probably 
01:29:03.171 drop  that. By  90% or  more  
01:29:06.740 it won't  it won't  be  
01:29:07.441 perfect,  but it'll be  
01:29:08.609 ten times better  
01:29:09.543 than that. The public will  
01:29:10.144 accept  that  you think the 
01:29:11.245 government  will  accept  
01:29:12.313 that. Well  in  large numbers 
01:29:15.850 the well  Well  it  will  
01:29:16.851 certainly be  so  obviously 
01:29:17.751 true  that  it  really  
01:29:20.554 cannot be denied. And what  
01:29:21.755 do you  think?  I know  we've 
01:29:22.556 talked  about the timeline  
01:29:23.457 before  and I know  people  
01:29:25.059 have  criticized you  for 
01:29:27.461 putting out timelines that  
01:29:28.729 may not have  come  true  
01:29:30.197 just  yet.  But what do you 
01:29:31.899 think?  Yeah  it is.  
01:29:33.901 Do you feel that? You 
01:29:34.502 yourself said that sure 
01:29:37.171 of course.  so yeah, I  I'm 
01:29:48.949 optimistic  about I mean, 
01:29:50.217 I think I'm like  naturally 
01:29:51.252 optimistic  about time  
01:29:52.052 scales. If I  was not 
01:29:53.120 naturally optimistic, I 
01:29:53.654 wouldn't  be  doing 
01:29:54.154 the things  
01:29:54.488 naturally optimistic. that  
01:29:55.089 I'm doing.  
01:29:55.422 naturally optimistic, 
01:29:56.857 I mean I certainly  want to 
01:29:57.458 start a rock  company or  
01:29:58.559 like  a car company if I  
01:29:59.760 wouldn't have some  sort of 
01:30:00.961 pathological  optimism  
01:30:01.962 frankly.  So  as  you 
01:30:06.166 pointed out many  people  
01:30:06.933 said  they would fail and 
01:30:07.902 in fact I said, I actually  I 
01:30:09.403 agreed with him I said, yes,  
01:30:10.404 we probably will  fail  and 
01:30:11.605 they're like, okay, but I 
01:30:14.174 thought SpaceX  and Tesla had 
01:30:15.309 less  than  I like okay,  
01:30:16.043 a 10% chance  of  success 
01:30:16.711 when  we started them.  So  
01:30:22.149 yeah  everybody but the 
01:30:24.251 self-driving  thing is  
01:30:26.220 I've been optimistic  about 
01:30:27.021 it, but we  certainly made  a 
01:30:30.224 lot of  progress  if  anybody 
01:30:31.591 If  progress. has tried the 
01:30:33.260 very  has been using  
01:30:34.461 the sort  of  full  
01:30:35.462 self-driving beta the 
01:30:37.064 progress  is, you know, 
01:30:38.665 every year  has been  
01:30:40.467 substantial.  It's  really  
01:30:43.170 now the point where in  most  
01:30:44.471 places  it'll take  you from  
01:30:46.473 one place to another  with  
01:30:47.374 no  interventions.  And the 
01:30:50.044 data  is  and unequivocal 
01:30:51.145 that  And and that  
01:30:54.982 supervised for  self-driving  
01:30:56.083 is  somewhere around  
01:30:57.785 four times  safer or maybe  
01:30:58.786 more  than  just  human 
01:31:01.388 driving by  by  themselves. 
01:31:04.892 So  I'm you know  
01:31:10.030 I can certainly see it  
01:31:10.564 coming  at  what actually 
01:31:11.665 really  the is  another five  
01:31:12.433 or  ten years and then  
01:31:13.100 people  say,  
01:31:14.234 oh, no definitely not 
01:31:14.735 oh no definitely not  
01:31:15.235 definitely  not did you feel  
01:31:17.671 like  investors have  
01:31:18.872 invested  in  something that  
01:31:20.341 hasn't  happened  yet?  Is  
01:31:21.342 that  is  that  fair  to  
01:31:22.476 them? And that's  the other 
01:31:23.877 questions people have about 
01:31:24.478 that. Well, I mean, I think 
01:31:25.980 the their Vol with  rare  
01:31:29.717 exception thought it  wasn't  
01:31:31.418 happening.  So  they  were  
01:31:32.219 investing in  despite 
01:31:33.553 thinking  they're very clear  
01:31:34.722 that  they  don't think it's  
01:31:35.589 real  so  real  it's  think 
01:31:36.256 don't they  very clear that 
01:31:36.857 they're thinking  they  don't 
01:31:37.491 saying  oh we're  we  just  
01:31:41.095 leave everything  you 
01:31:41.595 and says  Hook  Line  
01:31:42.096 & Sinker, We  we  but 
01:31:44.431 the thing is  that  I mean, I 
01:31:45.833 would be a  fair  criticism 
01:31:47.134 of  me  to say  that  I'm 
01:31:48.202 late, but it  isn't but I 
01:31:50.437 always  deliver in the  end.  
01:31:53.173 And that's your final 
01:31:53.673 question. I took  note of 
01:31:54.508 this. It was  November  11th. 
01:31:56.710 And you took  to  Twitter and 
01:31:58.212 you wrote only  two words.  
01:32:00.314 You said  amplify empathy.  
01:32:03.784 Right.  I was taken back  
01:32:05.085 by that given all the things  
01:32:07.221 that  have been going on  
01:32:07.888 in the world. You remember  
01:32:10.457 what you  were  thinking? 
01:32:13.394 Well, I think it's  quite 
01:32:14.261 literally a I understand  it  
01:32:16.063 but you always  what was  
01:32:17.197 going on. What  why did 
01:32:18.398 you write that? Well, I was 
01:32:22.803 encouraging people  to apply  
01:32:23.804 empathy.  It  
01:32:26.573 literally attention quite 
01:32:27.140 literal,  but was there 
01:32:28.475 something that  it  happened? 
01:32:30.978 That you  had seen  that  you 
01:32:31.979 said  yourself. I need  to  
01:32:33.180 I want to say that  I think 
01:32:35.048 I'm talking to some friends.  
01:32:38.018 And we all  agreed that we  
01:32:39.420 should  try to  amplify 
01:32:40.320 empathy and so I wrote  
01:32:42.823 a profanity.  If  you wanted  
01:32:46.994 an unvarnished  look  inside  
01:32:47.995 the mind  of  Elon  Musk. I 
01:32:49.196 think you just  saw it. 
01:32:50.698 Look sometimes it's pretty  
01:32:51.299 simple, you know. Elon  Musk. 
01:32:54.968 Thank you very very much  
01:32:55.803 for the conversation. 
01:32:57.104 Thank you.  
01:33:00.107 Thank you. Thank you  so  
01:33:00.674 much  here. Take that 
01:33:03.010 with your second cousin.  
01:33:06.714 I'm just going to say thank 
01:33:07.781 you to everybody who  stuck 
01:33:08.782 around  for what  has been  a 
01:33:10.584 remarkable  day.  We  are so  
01:33:12.186 appreciative  of  everybody 
01:33:13.987 who has been  with us for so  
01:33:15.455 many  years coming  back  to  
01:33:16.990 this  every year. So, 
01:33:18.425 thank you.  Thank you.  Thank 
01:33:19.293 you.  I hope  you had a great 
01:33:20.394 day,  and I hope  we  have  
01:33:22.029 an opportunity  to do this  
01:33:23.163 again Elon  Musk  everybody.  
01:33:24.798 Thank you.
