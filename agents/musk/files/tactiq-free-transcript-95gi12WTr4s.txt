00:00:01.120 and uh
00:00:02.240 we're finding the company for
00:00:03.919 merchandise sales
00:00:06.480 so thank you for anyone who's bought our
00:00:08.320 flamethrower
00:00:11.360 you will not be sorry or maybe you will
00:00:15.440 it won't be boring
00:00:18.960 that's what the freak
00:00:21.760 i don't mean to have it in black and
00:00:23.199 white it's like it's not so long ago
00:00:26.960 they didn't even have color cameras back
00:00:29.119 then
00:00:30.640 it was 2010.
00:00:39.760 that sounds like a password
00:00:42.719 yeah he's great
00:00:44.399 why don't you have solarcity providing
00:00:46.320 your your electricity
00:00:48.160 this is this little set the reason we
00:00:49.760 don't have a solar power right now is
00:00:52.879 that tesla is not yet a good enough
00:00:54.960 credit
00:00:55.610 [Laughter]
00:00:58.960 do you want to see the car
00:01:02.640 well
00:01:03.840 we don't have it for you tonight
00:01:07.600 i'm just kidding
00:01:10.560 it's april pool somewhere
00:01:13.600 all right let's bring him out
00:01:15.439 everyone in this room is inspired by you
00:01:17.520 who are you inspired by
00:01:19.759 what kanye west obviously
00:01:27.680 um the plane thing is not not a good
00:01:30.000 idea in my view um
00:01:32.320 the
00:01:33.520 so the the the plane um and the reason i
00:01:36.720 think it's like intuitively it seems
00:01:38.640 like a plane should work but but
00:01:40.320 actually if you consider that really
00:01:42.079 every mode of transport has a design
00:01:44.159 that is appropriate to its medium
00:01:46.799 and if you're in
00:01:48.720 space
00:01:50.159 wings are not very useful
00:01:52.399 because there's no error
00:01:54.399 um
00:01:56.079 and
00:01:57.439 and and then if you want to go somewhere
00:01:59.119 other than earth there's also no runways
00:02:03.200 so this is these are important
00:02:04.880 considerations
00:02:06.719 um we need some volunteers to be
00:02:08.720 colonists do we have any honest
00:02:10.080 volunteers here for more
00:02:13.760 i'm actually not many hands raised by
00:02:15.360 the way
00:02:18.160 what's the actual biggest failure that
00:02:20.319 you that you've gone through to get to
00:02:21.680 where you are
00:02:25.040 i mean we blew up three rockets on the
00:02:27.200 beginning
00:02:28.630 [Music]
00:02:30.480 where you're selling your houses you say
00:02:32.400 you don't want any material possessions
00:02:34.080 and i've been seeing all that and i've
00:02:35.360 been really excited to talk to you about
00:02:36.560 this i think i think possessions
00:02:38.800 kind of weigh you down
00:02:41.200 then they're kind of an attack vector
00:02:44.480 you know people say hey billionaire
00:02:46.160 you've got all this stuff like well now
00:02:47.920 don't have stuff now what you're going
00:02:49.280 to do
00:02:50.640 the
00:02:51.360 boost stage which is about 70 of the
00:02:53.360 cost of rockets so that what cost is
00:02:55.360 that how much is that
00:02:57.120 um
00:02:58.159 well i mean it's sort of on the order of
00:03:00.319 30 to 35 million dollars right so you
00:03:02.239 want to save that yeah i mean it's like
00:03:04.319 i try to tell my team it's like imagine
00:03:06.080 there was a pallet of cash
00:03:07.760 that was
00:03:08.720 vomiting through the atmosphere
00:03:12.000 and it was going to burn up and smash
00:03:14.080 into tiny pieces would you try to save
00:03:16.400 it right right right probably yes yes
00:03:19.120 okay yeah that sounds like a good idea
00:03:21.120 do you think
00:03:22.720 there is
00:03:23.680 other intelligent life outside the earth
00:03:27.599 it seems probable
00:03:29.440 but i think this is this is one of the
00:03:30.879 great questions in physics and
00:03:33.040 philosophy
00:03:34.560 is
00:03:35.760 where are the aliens
00:03:38.480 maybe they're among us i don't know
00:03:41.760 some people think i'm an alien
00:03:45.040 not true
00:03:46.879 not true
00:03:48.239 but
00:03:49.760 maybe we are of course i'd say maybe we
00:03:51.840 are alien no people are nervous and
00:03:53.680 they're worried you are aware of that
00:03:56.319 so knowing that why would you do an
00:03:58.000 april fool's joke that you did oh
00:03:59.920 because there were all these media
00:04:01.200 articles uh saying that tesla's going
00:04:02.879 bankrupt yes
00:04:04.480 um so i thought well i'll just do an a4
00:04:06.959 stroke that we did go bankrupt but elon
00:04:09.040 that's not funny when people are nervous
00:04:11.760 i mean it's april fools people should
00:04:13.120 like lighten up okay
00:04:18.560 great
00:04:20.399 should tax things that are most likely
00:04:22.320 to be bad rather than you know
00:04:24.800 like that's why we attack cigarettes and
00:04:26.160 alcohol
00:04:27.919 because those those are probably bad for
00:04:29.360 you
00:04:30.240 certainly cigarettes are um
00:04:36.800 what is this the largest rocket the
00:04:38.400 largest building i mean
00:04:40.400 well i mean i think this it's not scale
00:04:41.919 for scale sake it's just like if you say
00:04:43.840 well we want to accomplish these goals
00:04:45.680 then um
00:04:47.199 then you kind of have to be make a big
00:04:49.600 thing
00:04:50.720 okay
00:04:53.040 where do you sleep tonight
00:04:55.120 in the tonight's in the factory
00:04:57.440 in the factory
00:04:58.960 well technically a conference room in
00:05:00.400 the factory but yeah you sleep in a
00:05:02.160 conference room in the not finished
00:05:03.919 factory tonight yeah it gives me a good
00:05:05.520 feel for what's going on alone or
00:05:07.919 yeah i assume so
00:05:12.240 it's an invitation
00:05:17.759 yeah okay
00:05:19.280 finally
00:05:21.120 you're obviously a very competitive
00:05:22.800 person you're competing with the likes
00:05:24.320 of jeff bezos
00:05:25.680 uh in jeffree
00:05:27.480 [Laughter]
00:05:29.280 i'm going to watch my jokes here not
00:05:30.720 everyone gets irony you know remember
00:05:33.120 must remember
00:05:35.440 how do i sign up to test out your neural
00:05:37.680 net program
00:05:39.520 uh well just put this uh usbc port in
00:05:42.160 your head and
00:05:44.320 um
00:05:45.680 and then don't worry
00:05:47.600 i'm in it'll be fine right i tried
00:05:50.320 learning the violin yeah that's by the
00:05:52.479 way a hard thing to learn
00:05:53.710 [Laughter]
00:05:55.919 launching rockets electric cars yeah
00:05:58.240 revolutionizing transportation yeah i
00:06:00.240 cannot play the violin at all
00:06:02.000 very horrible
00:06:03.600 we saw the movie we know what happened
00:06:05.759 he got back yeah yeah um
00:06:08.960 so it was good i actually enjoyed the
00:06:10.160 movie um
00:06:12.319 so do you think he could have gotten
00:06:13.520 back like that it was that flaws well i
00:06:15.039 thought there was some you know
00:06:16.319 connection it was it was most it was
00:06:18.560 like 80 percent scientifically correct
00:06:21.919 um but that did connect to series of
00:06:23.919 improbable events such as
00:06:26.240 well i mean i don't think you can sort
00:06:27.520 of just uh take off from oz um on an
00:06:30.560 unguided rocket really and and then
00:06:33.520 prick your finger on the spacesuit and
00:06:35.199 navigate to us to a spaceship
00:06:38.000 right
00:06:41.120 yeah
00:06:42.160 not not impossible just extremely
00:06:43.759 unlikely
00:06:46.160 it's really just the cost of building
00:06:47.680 the tunnels
00:06:49.759 and
00:06:50.720 but really it's a tunnel's a hole in the
00:06:52.319 ground like how hot can it really be i
00:06:54.479 mean just
00:06:57.520 i think mars should really have great
00:06:58.960 bars
00:07:02.400 the mars bar
00:07:05.520 in terms of production
00:07:07.039 the the
00:07:08.319 thing that's going to be the major
00:07:09.759 challenge for us over the next six to
00:07:12.000 nine months is how do we build a huge
00:07:14.400 number of cars the
00:07:17.280 um
00:07:19.199 i mean and frankly we're going to be in
00:07:20.720 production hell um
00:07:23.039 welcome welcome
00:07:26.160 welcome to production hell crazy car to
00:07:28.319 have us daily drive particularly on the
00:07:29.520 405. so um
00:07:31.599 but i understand when you got it yeah
00:07:34.160 you're driving down 280
00:07:36.319 and you wrecked it
00:07:37.840 no uh well and you did let me just tell
00:07:39.759 the story that you can correct me
00:07:42.800 yeah let's see if the story that you
00:07:44.000 tell is actually how does that how that
00:07:45.599 compares to the reality because the
00:07:47.039 reality is pretty messed up so
00:07:49.520 hopefully the reality is better so you
00:07:51.360 wreck the car you get out of the car
00:07:53.360 you're doubling over with laughter
00:07:55.680 and the person with you said
00:07:57.520 why are you laughing that you just
00:07:58.960 wrecked this car and you said no you
00:08:00.800 don't know the funny part it wasn't
00:08:02.160 insured
00:08:05.680 well
00:08:06.800 the punch line's correct
00:08:12.400 i'm curious this may be an odd question
00:08:14.479 but one that i find fascinating as you
00:08:16.560 think here today back to your younger
00:08:18.879 self is there any advice you wish you
00:08:21.120 could have given your younger self in
00:08:22.639 with hindsight
00:08:23.840 given what you know now
00:08:26.240 well i mean i give like a lot of advice
00:08:30.560 going back to mars
00:08:32.640 what kind of government do you envision
00:08:34.640 for the first martian colony
00:08:38.880 um that's what happened and what's your
00:08:41.279 and what's your title yeah yeah exactly
00:08:44.080 emperor or god emperor i don't know
00:08:48.800 it might be too much i don't know
00:08:50.800 um
00:08:52.720 if
00:08:53.600 you're what i should watch my jokes here
00:08:54.959 not everyone gets irony you know
00:08:57.120 remember must remember
00:09:00.160 ever if if there's ever sort of an
00:09:03.519 apocalyptic scenario
00:09:05.920 of some kind
00:09:08.240 hypothetically
00:09:11.200 you just press the bioweapon defense
00:09:12.959 mode button
00:09:16.640 this is a real button
00:09:20.399 yeah we're trying to be a leader in the
00:09:21.760 [ __ ] there's been three flights so far
00:09:24.160 and and each one is has
00:09:26.080 obviously the goal is to get into orbit
00:09:27.760 each one has sort of not made it
00:09:29.920 um
00:09:31.839 how did you deal with the oh it got to
00:09:33.440 space okay got to space but it didn't
00:09:36.480 you didn't get where you wanted to go
00:09:37.920 not all the way um
00:09:40.880 sorry
00:09:43.760 well you know so but they necessarily go
00:09:46.240 all the way on the first few days spacex
00:09:48.720 has
00:09:52.560 oh my god dude
00:09:56.560 so [ __ ] dead
00:09:58.880 jesus wait is that a real picture i
00:10:00.800 think it's a real photo of a deer that
00:10:03.040 probably jumped into a pool and then
00:10:05.120 just
00:10:05.839 thrashed around and drowned
00:10:08.079 so that
00:10:09.519 is that true that's delightful
00:10:12.079 um
00:10:13.200 you know what is that actually that
00:10:14.399 actually happened
00:10:15.519 of course it happened i think i think
00:10:17.040 this is a reflection of how like oh my
00:10:19.760 god how do you
00:10:21.440 how do you plan a business where you
00:10:23.120 know
00:10:24.240 the rocket business you know some of
00:10:26.000 these things are going to blow up
00:10:27.839 on the launch pad
00:10:29.839 how does the business plan work i don't
00:10:32.480 really have a business plan
00:10:37.120 what would be your mediocre superpower
00:10:40.160 now
00:10:40.959 this is absurd to ask you because tony
00:10:43.360 stark is partially modeled after you so
00:10:45.600 you actually are sort of have real so we
00:10:47.839 are actually technically have a
00:10:49.279 superpower he i guess except like
00:10:51.600 inventing technology or something right
00:10:53.440 so we're sort of asking you to downgrade
00:10:54.720 from that event so an example of a media
00:10:56.480 mediocre superpower would be one of the
00:10:58.800 best ones we've ever gotten is this guy
00:11:00.959 who wished to temporarily detach his arm
00:11:03.920 while spooning with a girl
00:11:06.079 um sometimes it's set it's
00:11:08.640 sometimes it stays what he wants to do
00:11:10.240 with a girl
00:11:14.399 that's awesome
00:11:19.600 the room for improvement
00:11:22.399 the point of doing this is to just give
00:11:24.079 the hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars
00:11:33.920 when you think of kind of you know
00:11:35.560 [Laughter]
00:11:38.240 never know but
00:11:40.160 you know when you look at games and the
00:11:42.399 the games you play now i mean what are
00:11:44.320 the things you want to see in games that
00:11:45.600 don't happen right now
00:11:47.360 is there anything that like when you
00:11:48.320 play a game you're like i wish it did
00:11:49.440 this or i wish i
00:11:50.880 you know you're obviously thinking about
00:11:52.560 you know lots of things but when you
00:11:54.079 play games are you satisfied are there
00:11:56.240 things that frustrate you about games
00:11:57.519 what do you want to see games do in the
00:11:58.959 future
00:12:00.959 i don't know if i should say
00:12:02.639 yeah okay
00:12:05.440 even the base model of in even the base
00:12:07.440 model 3 will do zero to 60 miles an hour
00:12:10.079 or zero to 100 kilometers an hour in
00:12:11.600 less than six seconds
00:12:16.079 at tesla we don't we don't make slow
00:12:17.680 cars
00:12:18.560 okay what's a dream house for elon musk
00:12:20.959 like some tony stark type [ __ ] yeah
00:12:23.040 definitely
00:12:25.120 yeah you gotta have the the dome that
00:12:27.200 opens up with the stealth helicopter and
00:12:29.360 that kind of thing you know yeah but
00:12:30.880 just in terms of
00:12:32.240 how to how to think about a life
00:12:33.760 trajectory perhaps or um
00:12:36.079 how to pursue your passions
00:12:39.360 i mean
00:12:40.800 i'm reasonably happy with how things
00:12:42.240 turned out um
00:12:43.839 so it's like
00:12:46.240 touche
00:12:49.440 not terrible
00:12:50.720 yeah that's a good point
00:12:54.000 i just don't know how you manage your
00:12:55.279 time i don't understand it it doesn't
00:12:56.800 seem it doesn't even seem humanly
00:12:58.720 possible what would you call yourself
00:13:00.880 a business magnet
00:13:03.200 can someone please change my wikipedia
00:13:04.880 page to magnum they'll change it right
00:13:06.639 now it's probably already changed it's
00:13:08.320 locked so somebody has to be able to
00:13:10.000 unlock it and change it to magnets i
00:13:12.000 want to be a magnet
00:13:13.920 hi my name is rahul sanad from los
00:13:16.480 angeles and i have a tesla watch
00:13:20.959 we do not make tesla watches
00:13:24.720 it's electric whatever so i actually
00:13:26.720 went to i went to russia three times to
00:13:29.279 look at buying
00:13:31.519 a refurbished icvm
00:13:36.720 because
00:13:37.760 that was the best deal
00:13:41.120 and i can tell you it was very weird
00:13:43.120 going there in 2000 late 2001 2002
00:13:46.800 going to the russian rocket forces and
00:13:48.560 saying i'd like to buy
00:13:50.160 two of your biggest rockets
00:13:52.320 but you can keep the nuke
00:13:55.519 zero zero percent of the prediction are
00:13:57.760 right
00:13:58.560 they're right because by accident
00:14:01.040 yeah but it's also true that 80 percent
00:14:02.560 of statistics are false yeah
00:14:04.959 so
00:14:06.079 my meaning
00:14:07.360 come on guys
00:14:10.720 and a few years ago people were laughing
00:14:12.480 at you now
00:14:14.240 not so much i mean okay
00:14:17.279 are you working on a game too
00:14:19.279 no okay no no no but i mean like
00:14:22.079 i don't know i mean like
00:14:24.480 to i mean i was a bit more r-rated i
00:14:27.360 don't know okay
00:14:29.519 oh oh here's a good one here's a good
00:14:30.880 one look
00:14:31.839 the cat ate the melon yeah and now it
00:14:33.680 looks like the watermelon right now it
00:14:35.199 looks like a watermelon now the cat
00:14:36.399 looks like a [ __ ] watermelon are you
00:14:38.079 kidding me good luck with all this
00:14:39.440 footage where will tesla be in 10 years
00:14:42.079 you know
00:14:48.480 mars
00:14:50.160 exactly what's important here is
00:14:52.880 by nucleus survives a nuclear explosion
00:14:54.959 or you get a full refund
00:14:57.110 [Music]
00:14:58.959 it was like mr hollywood's walked into
00:15:01.199 town okay and it was like well you know
00:15:03.519 do i see mollywood
00:15:06.880 maybe
00:15:08.880 oh this is pretty great yeah
00:15:12.000 have you seen this one i saw it earlier
00:15:14.000 today oh you did okay be aware she can
00:15:16.320 move in any direction the queen is very
00:15:18.320 powerful i like that she's standing
00:15:20.079 perfectly in that black square yeah and
00:15:22.639 it makes you think she's gonna just only
00:15:24.320 step in step into squares like almost
00:15:27.120 like hubert she's worth a bishop
00:15:29.839 oh she's with a bishop yes
00:15:32.880 so this is like a game of chess yes
00:15:35.120 essentially and notice he's also on a
00:15:36.720 black square he is a queen and a bishop
00:15:41.199 a quote from one of your former
00:15:42.560 employees which i don't really summed up
00:15:44.160 a lot of what you have achieved he said
00:15:47.040 he is verner brown braun howard hughes
00:15:50.079 henry ford bill gates steve jobs and
00:15:53.279 every other badass rolled into one
00:16:04.560 i
00:16:05.440 yeah that's probably a bit generous
00:16:10.000 any any natural resource extraction on
00:16:11.600 mars would be the the output would be
00:16:13.759 for mars
00:16:14.880 like it definitely wouldn't make sense
00:16:16.160 to transport more stuff 200 million
00:16:18.240 miles back to earth
00:16:20.560 you know honestly like if you had like
00:16:22.000 crack cocaine on mars like in
00:16:24.240 pre-packaged you know pallets
00:16:28.000 it still wouldn't make sense to
00:16:29.120 transport it back here
00:16:32.079 maybe good times for the martians but
00:16:35.360 not back here young people globally want
00:16:37.920 to be like elon musk what's your advice
00:16:40.720 to them
00:16:42.959 i think that
00:16:44.320 probably
00:16:46.079 they shouldn't want to be
00:16:47.600 you it i think it sounds better than it
00:16:50.079 is okay um
00:16:53.519 yeah it's uh
00:16:56.000 not as much fun being me as you'd think
00:16:58.160 i don't know you don't think so yeah
00:17:00.800 there's definitely it could be worse for
00:17:02.320 sure but it's um
00:17:06.079 i i
00:17:07.119 i'm not sure i would i'm not sure i want
00:17:09.439 to be me
00:17:10.559 okay
00:17:13.119 but
00:17:14.319 if
00:17:14.990 [Music]
00:17:17.679 you could power the entire united states
00:17:19.839 um
00:17:21.119 with about
00:17:22.319 let's say 150 to 200 square kilometers
00:17:24.640 of solar panels the entire united states
00:17:27.760 take a corner of utah
00:17:31.039 there's not much going on there i've
00:17:32.400 been there hi elon i'm john younger and
00:17:34.960 i have to say for some more in here
00:17:36.640 absolutely
00:17:38.080 i'm telling you this is this is going to
00:17:39.280 get better and better it is
00:17:42.160 what would have happened if the fourth
00:17:43.520 one hadn't worked we would have failed
00:17:46.000 yeah but let's talk about the one of the
00:17:48.480 the failures were spectacular
00:17:54.160 i mean i saw i would go out to the
00:17:55.440 island the kojolan with you know
00:17:57.760 and
00:17:58.640 seeing giant exploding rockets is quite
00:18:00.240 an amazing sight
00:18:02.400 and i was one of the early investors in
00:18:04.480 spacex and i said you know what if all i
00:18:06.559 get to do
00:18:08.559 is to see these rockets explode
00:18:11.760 well worth every dime i
00:18:16.290 [Laughter]
00:18:22.559 there's something to be said about
00:18:23.840 brotherly support
00:18:27.039 we were first talking about the concept
00:18:28.720 you know tunnels feel like a resolutely
00:18:30.880 old-school
00:18:31.919 uh solution to a product that i invented
00:18:34.160 tunnels
00:18:36.960 you know do to push that metaphor even
00:18:38.880 more
00:18:39.760 are you afraid that whoever's hosting
00:18:42.400 the race could
00:18:44.160 tilt the race in favor
00:18:46.559 of
00:18:49.919 the chinese racer
00:18:52.720 [Applause]
00:19:04.000 i'm trying to figure out there's any way
00:19:05.039 to answer that question and not lose
00:19:06.800 [Laughter]
00:19:08.960 and then transforming that into some
00:19:11.840 sort of a biological state like you
00:19:13.919 could hang out with 30 year old you
00:19:17.760 i mean the possibilities are endless
00:19:21.840 that's so weird there's a lot of people
00:19:23.679 some of them citizen scientists some of
00:19:25.360 them they're just newbies when it comes
00:19:26.880 to tracking things in space they're
00:19:28.240 going to try and track the the tesla and
00:19:30.400 understand what's happening to it you
00:19:31.679 know like that movie dude where's my car
00:19:34.080 and other than the live webcam today
00:19:36.000 what is spacex going to do to interact
00:19:37.919 with this community of tesla trackers
00:19:40.480 once the car leaves orbit do you have a
00:19:42.480 plan are you just going to kind of wait
00:19:43.840 and see what bubbles up on the internet
00:19:45.280 and react to it
00:19:46.720 um we don't have a plan no plan
00:19:49.840 it's a car that is designed to
00:19:53.039 for you to have the most fun
00:19:55.039 um
00:19:56.000 and um
00:19:57.600 we keep
00:19:59.520 putting putting gems on it like the the
00:20:01.600 fart app of course that's one of my
00:20:03.280 favorites
00:20:04.799 it's like
00:20:06.559 perhaps my fun
00:20:08.080 perhaps my finest work
00:20:10.159 is there a parallel with how you build
00:20:12.159 companies in that story i hope not
00:20:16.320 let's see what this thing can do
00:20:19.120 yeah watch this
00:20:21.440 that could be awkward with a rocket
00:20:22.640 launch
00:20:27.520 i think it's more dangerous to pattern
00:20:29.200 than not patton
00:20:31.039 since our primary competitors are
00:20:32.720 national governments um the
00:20:34.559 enforceability of patents is
00:20:35.840 questionable
00:20:37.280 thanks elon and
00:20:38.640 oh i don't believe you about the aliens
00:20:41.600 i hope i'm wrong i mean i hope they're
00:20:43.280 like well if they are here i hope
00:20:45.120 they're nice you know
00:20:46.799 they haven't killed us yet so they must
00:20:48.080 be not that bad the valley accurate or
00:20:50.960 not accurate that's the show yeah
00:20:54.080 um
00:20:54.960 the
00:20:55.919 it starts to get very accurate around
00:20:58.240 around episode four
00:21:01.039 like you know when they're like first
00:21:03.200 launched like a 747 or or dc3 or
00:21:05.840 something like that i bet the chief
00:21:06.880 engineer was like i can't believe that
00:21:07.919 thing's flying
00:21:10.000 thought on on how to approach new
00:21:12.480 industries innovative areas and when's
00:21:14.880 the right time to jump in or not
00:21:17.840 or do you just
00:21:19.760 is there no crystal ball or is it a
00:21:21.760 crystal ball or a ouija board i mean how
00:21:23.520 do you how do you figure out what you
00:21:24.720 should go after
00:21:26.000 well definitely the ouija board of
00:21:27.200 course
00:21:30.159 much more reliable than the crystal yeah
00:21:32.640 um
00:21:34.000 actually met uh i met a woman i did
00:21:36.320 briefly in college um
00:21:38.960 who now works at scientific american as
00:21:40.559 a writer and uh and and she related the
00:21:44.000 anecdote that uh we were on a date i was
00:21:46.960 always talking about was electric cars
00:21:50.000 that was not a big winning conversation
00:21:53.520 so it was a bit of a monologue was it
00:21:55.360 yeah she said uh she said the first
00:21:57.520 question i asked her was do you ever
00:21:58.720 think about electric cars
00:22:02.400 no she never does so so you learned from
00:22:05.520 that that wasn't the best startup like
00:22:06.960 it wasn't it wasn't great
00:22:08.720 but it has
00:22:10.400 recently it's been more effective
00:22:13.760 there you go
00:22:14.960 i know this man
00:22:18.480 i find twitter quite engaging
00:22:20.960 how do you have the time
00:22:23.440 um well i mean
00:22:25.039 it's like
00:22:26.559 five minutes every couple hours type
00:22:28.240 thing it's not like i'm sitting on an
00:22:29.760 old day but but how i mean on a a
00:22:32.720 regular day for you are you are you are
00:22:34.480 you sleeping you're not sleeping a lot
00:22:35.840 right oh geez do i look that bad
00:22:38.240 no
00:22:39.120 um the new crew dragon design is be able
00:22:42.480 to land propulsively
00:22:44.159 uh with precision
00:22:45.919 um which i think is kind of the
00:22:48.400 the
00:22:49.120 next generation like if you consider the
00:22:50.960 first generation wars parachutes to a
00:22:52.720 water landing then um you know arguably
00:22:55.760 sort of wings and gear
00:22:57.760 landing legs over landing gear
00:23:00.240 then like the the sort of third
00:23:02.159 generation
00:23:03.360 is propulsive landing uh with precision
00:23:06.240 i mean if if you saw a movie about the
00:23:08.960 future with aliens landing how did they
00:23:11.440 land
00:23:12.320 like that
00:23:15.200 okay obviously
00:23:17.039 that would like
00:23:18.400 be kind of weird if the aliens landed in
00:23:20.720 the ocean with parachutes i'm like
00:23:22.720 okay
00:23:24.640 nothing to fear
00:23:31.600 are you now like [ __ ] no i am not
00:23:33.760 starting another company are you still
00:23:35.679 thinking about that that's how i feel
00:23:37.010 [Music]
00:23:37.160 [Laughter]
00:23:40.159 maybe discovered by some future alien
00:23:41.919 race
00:23:42.960 thinking what the heck what what were
00:23:44.480 these guys doing did they worship this
00:23:46.000 car
00:23:48.400 why do they have a little car in the car
00:23:51.600 that'll really confuse them
00:23:53.440 that that picture at the end is a
00:23:54.880 picture of one of the circuit boards
00:23:56.400 inside the roadster right yeah
00:23:59.279 um we try to confuse the aliens as much
00:24:01.039 as possible
00:24:02.720 i remember when you first told me that
00:24:04.880 you were thinking about tunnels
00:24:07.200 when did i first tell you about that
00:24:08.720 years ago okay it's like a long time ago
00:24:10.559 like i thought you were joking yeah
00:24:12.799 it was i was joking but
00:24:16.400 what about government
00:24:18.000 government policies like one of the
00:24:19.600 things that i would like to do is i
00:24:21.279 would i would just like to keep working
00:24:22.480 on my email as i'm driving to work sure
00:24:24.799 you know there's there's a 30 some
00:24:26.480 people do that already
00:24:30.720 like i said i would like to do it
00:24:32.080 without without uh without breaking the
00:24:34.400 law yeah
00:24:35.840 and he's he's a designer so he's he's
00:24:37.919 good at sort of the styling of the cars
00:24:40.080 but he thinks it's all about styling
00:24:42.320 um and it and and it's not
00:24:44.559 um
00:24:45.520 you know it's really this is
00:24:48.240 you know the the reason we don't have
00:24:49.600 electric cars is not for lack of styling
00:24:52.000 right
00:24:52.540 [Laughter]
00:24:56.000 with artificial intelligence we are
00:24:57.279 summoning the demon
00:24:59.200 you know you know all those stories
00:25:00.480 where there's the guy with the pentagram
00:25:02.480 and the holy water and he's like yeah
00:25:03.760 you sure you can control the demon
00:25:06.159 didn't work out
00:25:07.440 we were first talking about the concept
00:25:09.120 you know tunnels feel like a resolutely
00:25:11.279 old school
00:25:12.400 uh solution to a problem is that that i
00:25:14.159 invented tunnels
00:25:17.760 you're not likely to sort of end up
00:25:19.200 eating your
00:25:20.320 compatriots in a snowy
00:25:22.640 situation
00:25:24.000 uh
00:25:25.360 you know so
00:25:26.880 uh you can just take the train
00:25:33.679 we also have the most energy efficient
00:25:36.080 cars in the world
00:25:37.520 so this is the
00:25:38.960 epa miles per kilowatt hour
00:25:41.279 and you can see the the model three is
00:25:42.960 at around four
00:25:44.559 uh and then it ranges off to the right
00:25:47.120 the the
00:25:49.840 i don't wanna pick on the tron but it's
00:25:52.480 you know it's
00:25:56.240 there's room for improvement
00:25:58.320 so
00:26:00.320 it's wrong
00:26:06.960 if you speak french that's
00:26:10.080 that's that's quite funny
00:26:12.720 there are people who've been in the
00:26:13.760 rocketry business for decades
00:26:16.559 who say about you
00:26:18.720 that you don't know what you don't know
00:26:21.360 well i suppose that's true of anyone how
00:26:23.279 can anyone know what they don't know
00:26:28.370 [Music]
00:26:45.679 you
