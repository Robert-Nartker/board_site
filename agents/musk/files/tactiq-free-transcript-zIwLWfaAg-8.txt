00:00:12.520 Chris Anderson:Elon, hey, welcome back to TED.
00:00:15.560 It's great to have you here.
00:00:16.960 Elon Musk: Thanks for having me.
00:00:18.560 CA: So, in the next half hour or so,
00:00:21.440 we're going to spend some time
00:00:23.280 exploring your vision for whatan exciting future might look like,
00:00:27.200 which I guess makesthe first question a little ironic:
00:00:31.320 Why are you boring?
00:00:33.080 EM: Yeah.
00:00:34.320 I ask myself that frequently.
00:00:39.240 We're trying to dig a hole under LA,
00:00:43.400 and this is to create the beginning
00:00:46.600 of what will hopefullybe a 3D network of tunnels
00:00:51.520 to alleviate congestion.
00:00:53.760 So right now, one of the mostsoul-destroying things is traffic.
00:00:59.320 It affects peoplein every part of the world.
00:01:02.200 It takes away so much of your life.
00:01:06.040 It's horrible.
00:01:08.040 It's particularly horrible in LA.
00:01:09.680 (Laughter)
00:01:12.360 CA: I think you've brought with you
00:01:14.320 the first visualizationthat's been shown of this.
00:01:16.800 Can I show this?
00:01:18.160 EM: Yeah, absolutely.So this is the first time --
00:01:20.880 Just to show what we're talking about.
00:01:22.760 So a couple of key thingsthat are important
00:01:24.920 in having a 3D tunnel network.
00:01:28.840 First of all, you have to be able
00:01:30.480 to integrate the entranceand exit of the tunnel
00:01:32.760 seamlessly into the fabric of the city.
00:01:34.840 So by having an elevator,
00:01:38.520 sort of a car skate,that's on an elevator,
00:01:43.320 you can integrate the entranceand exits to the tunnel network
00:01:47.280 just by using two parking spaces.
00:01:50.840 And then the car gets on a skate.
00:01:52.960 There's no speed limit here,
00:01:54.360 so we're designing this to be ableto operate at 200 kilometers an hour.
00:01:59.400 CA: How much?
00:02:00.640 EM: 200 kilometers an hour,or about 130 miles per hour.
00:02:04.800 So you should be ableto get from, say, Westwood to LAX
00:02:11.039 in six minutes -- five, six minutes.
00:02:13.320 (Applause)
00:02:17.680 CA: So possibly, initially done,
00:02:19.280 it's like on a sortof toll road-type basis.
00:02:21.600 EM: Yeah.
00:02:22.840 CA: Which, I guess,alleviates some traffic
00:02:24.920 from the surface streets as well.
00:02:26.640 EM: So, I don't knowif people noticed it in the video,
00:02:29.280 but there's no real limitto how many levels of tunnel you can have.
00:02:34.440 You can go much further deepthan you can go up.
00:02:37.280 The deepest mines are much deeperthan the tallest buildings are tall,
00:02:41.480 so you can alleviate any arbitrarylevel of urban congestion
00:02:46.760 with a 3D tunnel network.
00:02:48.080 This is a very important point.
00:02:49.640 So a key rebuttal to the tunnelsis that if you add one layer of tunnels,
00:02:56.040 that will simply alleviate congestion,it will get used up,
00:02:58.840 and then you'll be back where you started,back with congestion.
00:03:02.160 But you can go to anyarbitrary number of tunnels,
00:03:04.600 any number of levels.
00:03:05.960 CA: But people -- seen traditionally,it's incredibly expensive to dig,
00:03:09.520 and that would block this idea.
00:03:11.320 EM: Yeah.
00:03:13.040 Well, they're right.
00:03:14.280 To give you an example,the LA subway extension,
00:03:18.080 which is -- I think it'sa two-and-a-half mile extension
00:03:21.760 that was just completedfor two billion dollars.
00:03:24.023 So it's roughly a billion dollars a mileto do the subway extension in LA.
00:03:29.440 And this is not the highestutility subway in the world.
00:03:33.440 So yeah, it's quite difficultto dig tunnels normally.
00:03:37.960 I think we need to haveat least a tenfold improvement
00:03:41.160 in the cost per mile of tunneling.
00:03:44.160 CA: And how could you achieve that?
00:03:48.240 EM: Actually, if you just do two things,
00:03:50.320 you can get to approximatelyan order of magnitude improvement,
00:03:53.680 and I think you can go beyond that.
00:03:55.880 So the first thing to dois to cut the tunnel diameter
00:04:00.160 by a factor of two or more.
00:04:01.800 So a single road lane tunnelaccording to regulations
00:04:05.800 has to be 26 feet,maybe 28 feet in diameter
00:04:08.680 to allow for crashesand emergency vehicles
00:04:11.880 and sufficient ventilationfor combustion engine cars.
00:04:16.160 But if you shrink that diameterto what we're attempting,
00:04:19.760 which is 12 feet, which is plentyto get an electric skate through,
00:04:23.440 you drop the diameter by a factor of two
00:04:26.680 and the cross-sectional areaby a factor of four,
00:04:30.600 and the tunneling cost scaleswith the cross-sectional area.
00:04:33.480 So that's roughly a half-orderof magnitude improvement right there.
00:04:36.720 Then tunneling machines currently tunnelfor half the time, then they stop,
00:04:41.640 and then the rest of the timeis putting in reinforcements
00:04:44.840 for the tunnel wall.
00:04:46.160 So if you design the machine instead
00:04:48.400 to do continuoustunneling and reinforcing,
00:04:50.760 that will give youa factor of two improvement.
00:04:53.000 Combine that and that's a factor of eight.
00:04:55.240 Also these machines are far from beingat their power or thermal limits,
00:04:59.920 so you can jack up the powerto the machine substantially.
00:05:03.000 I think you can getat least a factor of two,
00:05:05.160 maybe a factor of four or fiveimprovement on top of that.
00:05:09.360 So I think there's a fairlystraightforward series of steps
00:05:13.600 to get somewhere in excessof an order of magnitude improvement
00:05:16.600 in the cost per mile,
00:05:18.360 and our target actually is --
00:05:21.320 we've got a pet snail called Gary,
00:05:24.160 this is from Gary the snailfrom "South Park,"
00:05:26.720 I mean, sorry, "SpongeBob SquarePants."
00:05:29.680 (Laughter)
00:05:31.280 So Gary is capable of --
00:05:35.720 currently he's capableof going 14 times faster
00:05:39.840 than a tunnel-boring machine.
00:05:41.640 (Laughter)
00:05:44.440 CA: You want to beat Gary.
00:05:46.240 EM: We want to beat Gary.
00:05:47.560 (Laughter)
00:05:49.120 He's not a patient little fellow,
00:05:51.360 and that will be victory.
00:05:54.480 Victory is beating the snail.
00:05:57.280 CA: But a lot of people imagining,dreaming about future cities,
00:06:00.360 they imagine that actuallythe solution is flying cars, drones, etc.
00:06:04.280 You go aboveground.
00:06:06.520 Why isn't that a better solution?
00:06:08.360 You save all that tunneling cost.
00:06:10.360 EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.
00:06:12.600 Obviously, I do rockets,so I like things that fly.
00:06:16.480 This is not some inherent biasagainst flying things,
00:06:19.440 but there is a challenge with flying cars
00:06:22.520 in that they'll be quite noisy,
00:06:25.840 the wind force generatedwill be very high.
00:06:32.000 Let's just say that if something'sflying over your head,
00:06:34.720 a whole bunch of flying carsgoing all over the place,
00:06:38.440 that is not an anxiety-reducing situation.
00:06:43.080 (Laughter)
00:06:45.200 You don't think to yourself,"Well, I feel better about today."
00:06:50.520 You're thinking,"Did they service their hubcap,
00:06:53.160 or is it going to come offand guillotine me?"
00:06:56.080 Things like that.
00:07:00.320 CA: So you've got this vision
00:07:01.920 of future cities with these rich,3D networks of tunnels underneath.
00:07:07.240 Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?
00:07:09.280 Could you apply these tunnelsto use for this Hyperloop idea
00:07:12.840 you released a few years ago.
00:07:14.840 EM: Yeah, so we've beensort of puttering around
00:07:18.080 with the Hyperloop stuff for a while.
00:07:20.720 We built a Hyperloop test trackadjacent to SpaceX,
00:07:24.560 just for a student competition,
00:07:26.720 to encourage innovativeideas in transport.
00:07:29.760 And it actually ends up beingthe biggest vacuum chamber in the world
00:07:34.800 after the Large Hadron Collider,
00:07:37.800 by volume.
00:07:41.320 So it was quite fun to do that,but it was kind of a hobby thing,
00:07:46.800 and then we think we might --
00:07:50.520 so we've built a little pusher carto push the student pods,
00:07:56.440 but we're going to try seeinghow fast we can make the pusher go
00:08:00.400 if it's not pushing something.
00:08:02.720 So we're cautiously optimistic
00:08:05.080 we'll be able to be fasterthan the world's fastest bullet train
00:08:10.120 even in a .8-mile stretch.
00:08:12.400 CA: Whoa. Good brakes.
00:08:14.960 EM: Yeah, I mean, it's -- yeah.
00:08:17.240 It's either going to smashinto tiny pieces or go quite fast.
00:08:21.880 CA: But you can picture,then, a Hyperloop in a tunnel
00:08:25.480 running quite long distances.
00:08:27.320 EM: Exactly.
00:08:29.040 And looking at tunneling technology,
00:08:30.840 it turns out thatin order to make a tunnel,
00:08:33.400 you have to --
00:08:36.320 In order to seal against the water table,
00:08:38.720 you've got to typically designa tunnel wall to be good
00:08:43.400 to about five or six atmospheres.
00:08:47.159 So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,
00:08:50.200 or near-vacuum.
00:08:51.640 So actually, it sort of turns outthat automatically,
00:08:56.080 if you build a tunnel that is good enoughto resist the water table,
00:09:00.080 it is automaticallycapable of holding vacuum.
00:09:02.520 CA: Huh.
00:09:04.160 EM: So, yeah.
00:09:05.720 CA: And so you could actually picture,
00:09:07.600 what kind of length tunnelis in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?
00:09:13.320 EM: I think there's no real length limit.
00:09:16.560 You could dig as much as you want.
00:09:19.600 I think if you were to do something
00:09:21.840 like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,
00:09:27.040 I think you'd probably wantto go underground the entire way
00:09:29.920 because it's a high-density area.
00:09:31.560 You're going undera lot of buildings and houses,
00:09:35.640 and if you go deep enough,
00:09:37.200 you cannot detect the tunnel.
00:09:39.600 Sometimes people think,well, it's going to be pretty annoying
00:09:42.560 to have a tunnel dug under my house.
00:09:44.440 Like, if that tunnel is dug
00:09:45.800 more than about three or fourtunnel diameters beneath your house,
00:09:49.000 you will not be ableto detect it being dug at all.
00:09:52.880 In fact, if you're ableto detect the tunnel being dug,
00:09:59.600 whatever device you are using,
00:10:01.240 you can get a lot of moneyfor that device from the Israeli military,
00:10:04.530 who is trying to detecttunnels from Hamas,
00:10:07.636 and from the US Customs and Border patrolthat try and detect drug tunnels.
00:10:12.440 So the reality is
00:10:15.680 that earth is incredibly goodat absorbing vibrations,
00:10:19.560 and once the tunnel depthis below a certain level,
00:10:22.560 it is undetectable.
00:10:24.560 Maybe if you have a very sensitiveseismic instrument,
00:10:27.160 you might be able to detect it.
00:10:29.280 CA: So you've starteda new company to do this
00:10:31.680 called The Boring Company.
00:10:33.400 Very nice. Very funny.
00:10:35.360 (Laughter)
00:10:36.760 EM: What's funny about that?
00:10:38.280 (Laughter)
00:10:40.920 CA: How much of your time is this?
00:10:43.600 EM: It's maybe ...
00:10:47.680 two or three percent.
00:10:49.440 CA: You've called it a hobby.
00:10:50.880 This is what an Elon Muskhobby looks like.
00:10:53.520 (Laughter)
00:10:54.560 EM: I mean, it really is, like --
00:10:57.040 This is basically internsand people doing it part time.
00:11:03.320 We bought some second-hand machinery.
00:11:08.040 It's kind of puttering along,but it's making good progress, so --
00:11:12.000 CA: So an even bigger part of your time
00:11:13.920 is being spent on electrifyingcars and transport through Tesla.
00:11:19.440 Is one of the motivationsfor the tunneling project
00:11:22.040 the realization that actually,
00:11:24.600 in a world where cars are electricand where they're self-driving,
00:11:28.040 there may end up beingmore cars on the roads
00:11:31.600 on any given hour than there are now?
00:11:34.000 EM: Yeah, exactly.
00:11:38.040 A lot of people thinkthat when you make cars autonomous,
00:11:42.360 they'll be able to go fasterand that will alleviate congestion.
00:11:47.000 And to some degree that will be true,
00:11:48.920 but once you have shared autonomywhere it's much cheaper to go by car
00:11:54.000 and you can go point to point,
00:11:56.960 the affordability of going in a carwill be better than that of a bus.
00:12:02.120 Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket.
00:12:04.360 So the amount of driving that will occurwill be much greater with shared autonomy,
00:12:09.440 and actually traffic will get far worse.
00:12:12.320 CA: You started Teslawith the goal of persuading the world
00:12:16.600 that electrificationwas the future of cars,
00:12:19.760 and a few years ago,people were laughing at you.
00:12:22.160 Now, not so much.
00:12:24.640 EM: OK.
00:12:25.880 (Laughter)
00:12:27.840 I don't know. I don't know.
00:12:30.080 CA: But isn't it true that pretty muchevery auto manufacturer
00:12:33.520 has announcedserious electrification plans
00:12:36.560 for the short- to medium-term future?
00:12:40.000 EM: Yeah. Yeah.
00:12:43.280 I think almost every automakerhas some electric vehicle program.
00:12:48.280 They vary in seriousness.
00:12:49.560 Some are very seriousabout transitioning entirely to electric,
00:12:53.880 and some are just dabbling in it.
00:12:57.280 And some, amazingly,are still pursuing fuel cells,
00:12:59.720 but I think that won't last much longer.
00:13:01.880 CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon,
00:13:03.960 where you can now just declare victoryand say, you know, "We did it."
00:13:07.680 Let the world electrify,and you go on and focus on other stuff?
00:13:13.520 EM: Yeah.
00:13:16.320 I intend to stay with Teslaas far into the future as I can imagine,
00:13:20.920 and there are a lot of excitingthings that we have coming.
00:13:25.600 Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon.
00:13:27.800 We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck.
00:13:32.120 CA: OK, we're going to come to this.
00:13:34.080 So Model 3, it's supposedto be coming in July-ish.
00:13:39.080 EM: Yeah, it's looking quite goodfor starting production in July.
00:13:43.640 CA: Wow.
00:13:45.040 One of the thingsthat people are so excited about
00:13:47.440 is the fact that it's got autopilot.
00:13:50.680 And you put out this video a while back
00:13:53.040 showing what that technologywould look like.
00:13:58.400 EM: Yeah.
00:13:59.640 CA: There's obviously autopilotin Model S right now.
00:14:02.170 What are we seeing here?
00:14:03.560 EM: Yeah, so this is usingonly cameras and GPS.
00:14:09.600 So there's no LIDARor radar being used here.
00:14:12.120 This is just using passive optical,which is essentially what a person uses.
00:14:17.200 The whole road systemis meant to be navigated
00:14:19.720 with passive optical, or cameras,
00:14:23.800 and so once you solve cameras
00:14:27.160 or vision,
00:14:29.720 then autonomy is solved.
00:14:31.240 If you don't solve vision,it's not solved.
00:14:34.120 So that's why our focus isso heavily on having a vision neural net
00:14:40.160 that's very effective for road conditions.
00:14:43.400 CA: Right. Many other peopleare going the LIDAR route.
00:14:46.040 You want cameras plus radar is most of it.
00:14:48.920 EM: You can absolutelybe superhuman with just cameras.
00:14:52.320 Like, you can probably do itten times better than humans would,
00:14:55.360 just cameras.
00:14:56.640 CA: So the new cars being sold right nowhave eight cameras in them.
00:15:01.120 They can't yet do what that showed.
00:15:05.480 When will they be able to?
00:15:08.440 EM: I think we're still on trackfor being able to go cross-country
00:15:14.200 from LA to New York by the endof the year, fully autonomous.
00:15:18.400 CA: OK, so by the endof the year, you're saying,
00:15:22.200 someone's going to sit in a Teslawithout touching the steering wheel,
00:15:26.200 tap in "New York," off it goes.
00:15:28.720 EM: Yeah.
00:15:29.960 CA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel --by the end of 2017.
00:15:34.280 EM: Yeah. Essentially,November or December of this year,
00:15:38.920 we should be able to go all the wayfrom a parking lot in California
00:15:43.360 to a parking lot in New York,
00:15:45.040 no controls touched at any pointduring the entire journey.
00:15:48.800 (Applause)
00:15:50.840 CA: Amazing.
00:15:52.080 But part of that is possible
00:15:53.520 because you've already got a fleetof Teslas driving all these roads.
00:15:56.960 You're accumulating a huge amountof data of that national road system.
00:16:03.440 EM: Yes, but the thingthat will be interesting
00:16:06.120 is that I'm actually fairly confidentit will be able to do that route
00:16:12.960 even if you change the route dynamically.
00:16:16.840 So, it's fairly easy --
00:16:20.040 If you say I'm going to be really goodat one specific route, that's one thing,
00:16:23.800 but it should be able to go,really be very good,
00:16:28.960 certainly once you enter a highway,
00:16:30.720 to go anywhere on the highway system
00:16:33.520 in a given country.
00:16:36.040 So it's not sort of limitedto LA to New York.
00:16:38.360 We could change itand make it Seattle-Florida,
00:16:41.840 that day, in real time.
00:16:44.400 So you were going from LA to New York.
00:16:46.560 Now go from LA to Toronto.
00:16:50.320 CA: So leaving asideregulation for a second,
00:16:53.080 in terms of the technology alone,
00:16:55.880 the time when someonewill be able to buy one of your cars
00:16:59.720 and literally just take the handsoff the wheel and go to sleep
00:17:03.560 and wake up and find that they've arrived,
00:17:05.640 how far away is that, to do that safely?
00:17:07.599 EM: I think that's about two years.
00:17:09.880 So the real trick of itis not how do you make it work
00:17:13.280 say 99.9 percent of the time,
00:17:16.240 because, like, if a car crashesone in a thousand times,
00:17:20.358 then you're probably still not goingto be comfortable falling asleep.
00:17:27.520 You shouldn't be, certainly.
00:17:29.080 (Laughter)
00:17:32.040 It's never going to be perfect.
00:17:34.960 No system is going to be perfect,
00:17:36.720 but if you say it's perhaps --
00:17:40.520 the car is unlikely to crash
00:17:42.960 in a hundred lifetimes,or a thousand lifetimes,
00:17:46.440 then people are like, OK, wow,if I were to live a thousand lives,
00:17:50.360 I would still most likelynever experience a crash,
00:17:53.000 then that's probably OK.
00:17:54.400 CA: To sleep.
00:17:55.640 I guess the big concern of yoursis that people may actually
00:17:58.520 get seduced too earlyto think that this is safe,
00:18:00.830 and that you'll have some horribleincident happen that puts things back.
00:18:05.400 EM: Well, I think that the autonomy systemis likely to at least mitigate the crash,
00:18:11.440 except in rare circumstances.
00:18:14.280 The thing to appreciateabout vehicle safety
00:18:16.600 is this is probabilistic.
00:18:20.920 I mean, there's some chance that any timea human driver gets in a car,
00:18:24.400 that they will have an accidentthat is their fault.
00:18:27.360 It's never zero.
00:18:29.440 So really the key threshold for autonomy
00:18:33.840 is how much better does autonomyneed to be than a person
00:18:38.280 before you can rely on it?
00:18:39.680 CA: But once you getliterally safe hands-off driving,
00:18:43.120 the power to disruptthe whole industry seems massive,
00:18:45.960 because at that point you've spokenof people being able to buy a car,
00:18:50.360 drops you off at work,and then you let it go
00:18:52.520 and provide a sort of Uber-likeservice to other people,
00:18:56.520 earn you money,
00:18:57.760 maybe even cover the costof your lease of that car,
00:19:00.240 so you can kind of get a car for free.
00:19:02.120 Is that really likely?
00:19:03.400 EM: Yeah. Absolutelythis is what will happen.
00:19:06.280 So there will be a shared autonomy fleet
00:19:08.280 where you buy your car
00:19:09.560 and you can chooseto use that car exclusively,
00:19:13.000 you could choose to have it be usedonly by friends and family,
00:19:16.720 only by other driverswho are rated five star,
00:19:21.800 you can choose to share it sometimesbut not other times.
00:19:28.120 That's 100 percent what will occur.
00:19:31.440 It's just a question of when.
00:19:33.960 CA: Wow.
00:19:35.200 So you mentioned the Semi
00:19:37.440 and I think you're planningto announce this in September,
00:19:40.200 but I'm curious whether there'sanything you could show us today?
00:19:43.320 EM: I will show youa teaser shot of the truck.
00:19:47.200 (Laughter)
00:19:49.720 It's alive.
00:19:51.680 CA: OK.
00:19:52.920 EM: That's definitely a casewhere we want to be cautious
00:19:55.640 about the autonomy features.
00:19:58.360 Yeah.
00:19:59.600 (Laughter)
00:20:01.240 CA: We can't see that much of it,
00:20:02.880 but it doesn't look likejust a little friendly neighborhood truck.
00:20:06.120 It looks kind of badass.
00:20:07.400 What sort of semi is this?
00:20:11.160 EM: So this is a heavy duty,long-range semitruck.
00:20:15.760 So it's the highest weight capability
00:20:20.040 and with long range.
00:20:23.120 So essentially it's meant to alleviatethe heavy-duty trucking loads.
00:20:29.280 And this is something whichpeople do not today think is possible.
00:20:34.600 They think the truck doesn't have enoughpower or it doesn't have enough range,
00:20:38.360 and then with the Tesla Semi
00:20:40.920 we want to show that no, an electric truck
00:20:43.600 actually can out-torque any diesel semi.
00:20:49.640 And if you had a tug-of-war competition,
00:20:53.800 the Tesla Semiwill tug the diesel semi uphill.
00:20:58.880 (Laughter)
00:21:01.160 (Applause)
00:21:03.040 CA: That's pretty cool.And short term, these aren't driverless.
00:21:06.080 These are going to be trucksthat truck drivers want to drive.
00:21:10.480 EM: Yes. So what will bereally fun about this
00:21:13.120 is you have a flat torque RPM curvewith an electric motor,
00:21:18.520 whereas with a diesel motor or any kindof internal combustion engine car,
00:21:22.040 you've got a torque RPM curvethat looks like a hill.
00:21:25.840 So this will be a very spry truck.
00:21:28.800 You can drive thisaround like a sports car.
00:21:31.680 There's no gears.It's, like, single speed.
00:21:34.080 CA: There's a great movieto be made here somewhere.
00:21:36.560 I don't know what it isand I don't know that it ends well,
00:21:39.360 but it's a great movie.
00:21:40.600 (Laughter)
00:21:41.640 EM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.
00:21:44.400 When I was driving the test prototypefor the first truck.
00:21:48.440 It's really weird,because you're driving around
00:21:50.720 and you're just so nimble,and you're in this giant truck.
00:21:53.840 CA: Wait, you'vealready driven a prototype?
00:21:57.360 EM: Yeah, I drove itaround the parking lot,
00:21:59.480 and I was like, this is crazy.
00:22:00.960 CA: Wow. This is no vaporware.
00:22:03.160 EM: It's just like,driving this giant truck
00:22:05.280 and making these mad maneuvers.
00:22:07.280 CA: This is cool.OK, from a really badass picture
00:22:09.760 to a kind of less badass picture.
00:22:12.400 This is just a cute housefrom "Desperate Housewives" or something.
00:22:15.760 What on earth is going on here?
00:22:18.840 EM: Well, this illustratesthe picture of the future
00:22:21.320 that I think is how things will evolve.
00:22:24.320 You've got an electric carin the driveway.
00:22:26.680 If you look in betweenthe electric car and the house,
00:22:30.440 there are actually three Powerwallsstacked up against the side of the house,
00:22:34.320 and then that house roof is a solar roof.
00:22:37.160 So that's an actual solar glass roof.
00:22:39.280 CA: OK.
00:22:40.520 EM: That's a picture of a real --well, admittedly, it's a real fake house.
00:22:44.800 That's a real fake house.
00:22:46.480 (Laughter)
00:22:49.600 CA: So these roof tiles,
00:22:51.480 some of them have in thembasically solar power, the ability to --
00:22:57.640 EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles
00:22:59.360 where you can adjustthe texture and the color
00:23:04.480 to a very fine-grained level,
00:23:06.480 and then there'ssort of microlouvers in the glass,
00:23:12.080 such that when you're lookingat the roof from street level
00:23:15.560 or close to street level,
00:23:17.280 all the tiles look the same
00:23:19.680 whether there is a solar cellbehind it or not.
00:23:26.000 So you have an even color
00:23:29.440 from the ground level.
00:23:32.960 If you were to look at itfrom a helicopter,
00:23:35.080 you would be actually ableto look through and see
00:23:37.480 that some of the glass tiles havea solar cell behind them and some do not.
00:23:41.520 You can't tell from street level.
00:23:43.160 CA: You put them in the onesthat are likely to see a lot of sun,
00:23:46.240 and that makes these roofssuper affordable, right?
00:23:48.640 They're not that much more expensivethan just tiling the roof.
00:23:51.640 EM: Yeah.
00:23:53.840 We're very confidentthat the cost of the roof
00:23:57.840 plus the cost of electricity --
00:24:01.920 A solar glass roof will be lessthan the cost of a normal roof
00:24:04.880 plus the cost of electricity.
00:24:06.320 So in other words,
00:24:07.600 this will be economically a no-brainer,
00:24:11.960 we think it will look great,
00:24:13.680 and it will last --
00:24:15.840 We thought about havingthe warranty be infinity,
00:24:18.920 but then people thought,
00:24:20.160 well, that might soundlike were just talking rubbish,
00:24:22.760 but actually this is toughened glass.
00:24:28.400 Well after the house has collapsed
00:24:31.320 and there's nothing there,
00:24:33.240 the glass tiles will still be there.
00:24:36.800 (Applause)
00:24:38.400 CA: I mean, this is cool.
00:24:40.160 So you're rolling this outin a couple week's time, I think,
00:24:43.040 with four different roofing types.
00:24:45.600 EM: Yeah, we're starting offwith two, two initially,
00:24:48.160 and the second twowill be introduced early next year.
00:24:51.360 CA: And what's the scale of ambition here?
00:24:53.440 How many houses do you believecould end up having this type of roofing?
00:24:59.760 EM: I think eventually
00:25:02.560 almost all houses will have a solar roof.
00:25:07.880 The thing is to considerthe time scale here
00:25:11.440 to be probably on the order
00:25:13.920 of 40 or 50 years.
00:25:17.120 So on average, a roofis replaced every 20 to 25 years.
00:25:23.400 But you don't start replacingall roofs immediately.
00:25:26.760 But eventually,if you say were to fast-forward
00:25:30.120 to say 15 years from now,
00:25:33.600 it will be unusual to have a roofthat does not have solar.
00:25:37.840 CA: Is there a mental model thingthat people don't get here
00:25:40.720 that because of the shift in the cost,the economics of solar power,
00:25:45.160 most houses actually haveenough sunlight on their roof
00:25:49.280 pretty much to power all of their needs.
00:25:51.360 If you could capture the power,
00:25:53.280 it could pretty muchpower all their needs.
00:25:55.360 You could go off-grid, kind of.
00:25:56.920 EM: It depends on where you are
00:25:58.480 and what the house size isrelative to the roof area,
00:26:01.760 but it's a fair statement to say
00:26:03.640 that most houses in the UShave enough roof area
00:26:08.480 to power all the needs of the house.
00:26:11.800 CA: So the key to the economics
00:26:15.000 of the cars, the Semi, of these houses
00:26:19.040 is the falling priceof lithium-ion batteries,
00:26:22.960 which you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.
00:26:25.480 In many ways, that's almostthe core competency.
00:26:27.760 And you've decided
00:26:30.040 that to really, like, own that competency,
00:26:35.280 you just have to buildthe world's largest manufacturing plant
00:26:38.760 to double the world's supplyof lithium-ion batteries,
00:26:41.920 with this guy. What is this?
00:26:44.240 EM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,
00:26:47.720 progress so far on the Gigafactory.
00:26:50.440 Eventually, you can sort of roughly see
00:26:52.360 that there's sort ofa diamond shape overall,
00:26:55.320 and when it's fully done,it'll look like a giant diamond,
00:26:59.960 or that's the idea behind it,
00:27:02.200 and it's aligned on true north.
00:27:03.720 It's a small detail.
00:27:05.480 CA: And capable of producing, eventually,
00:27:09.400 like a hundred gigawatt hoursof batteries a year.
00:27:12.600 EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.We think probably more, but yeah.
00:27:15.600 CA: And they're actuallybeing produced right now.
00:27:18.000 EM: They're in production already.CA: You guys put out this video.
00:27:21.200 I mean, is that speeded up?
00:27:22.560 EM: That's the slowed down version.
00:27:24.280 (Laughter)
00:27:26.080 CA: How fast does it actually go?
00:27:28.440 EM: Well, when it's running at full speed,
00:27:31.280 you can't actually see the cellswithout a strobe light.
00:27:35.240 It's just blur.
00:27:36.540 (Laughter)
00:27:40.000 CA: One of your core ideas, Elon,about what makes an exciting future
00:27:43.600 is a future where we no longerfeel guilty about energy.
00:27:47.480 Help us picture this.
00:27:48.920 How many Gigafactories, if you like,does it take to get us there?
00:27:53.960 EM: It's about a hundred, roughly.
00:27:55.720 It's not 10, it's not a thousand.
00:27:57.480 Most likely a hundred.
00:28:00.040 CA: See, I find this amazing.
00:28:01.720 You can picture what it would take
00:28:05.720 to move the worldoff this vast fossil fuel thing.
00:28:09.000 It's like you're building one,
00:28:11.600 it costs five billion dollars,
00:28:14.480 or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.
00:28:16.640 Like, it's kind of coolthat you can picture that project.
00:28:20.280 And you're planning to do, at Tesla --announce another two this year.
00:28:25.480 EM: I think we'll announce locations
00:28:28.360 for somewhere between twoand four Gigafactories later this year.
00:28:32.120 Yeah, probably four.
00:28:34.040 CA: Whoa.
00:28:35.680 (Applause)
00:28:38.320 No more teasing from you for here?
00:28:42.400 Like -- where, continent?
00:28:47.480 You can say no.
00:28:49.440 EM: We need to address a global market.
00:28:53.240 CA: OK.
00:28:54.480 (Laughter)
00:28:55.840 This is cool.
00:28:59.480 I think we should talk for --
00:29:04.560 Actually, global market.
00:29:06.200 I'm going to ask you one questionabout politics, only one.
00:29:10.320 I'm kind of sick of politics,but I do want to ask you this.
00:29:13.600 You're on a body nowgiving advice to a guy --
00:29:19.960 EM: Who?
00:29:21.200 CA: Who has said he doesn'treally believe in climate change,
00:29:24.120 and there's a lot of people out therewho think you shouldn't be doing that.
00:29:28.480 They'd like you to walk away from that.
00:29:30.400 What would you say to them?
00:29:32.720 EM: Well, I think that first of all,
00:29:36.360 I'm just on two advisory councils
00:29:38.920 where the format consistsof going around the room
00:29:41.760 and asking people's opinion on things,
00:29:44.680 and so there's like a meetingevery month or two.
00:29:49.560 That's the sum total of my contribution.
00:29:52.800 But I think to the degreethat there are people in the room
00:29:55.600 who are arguing in favorof doing something about climate change,
00:30:00.360 or social issues,
00:30:06.520 I've used the meetings I've had thus far
00:30:09.760 to argue in favor of immigrationand in favor of climate change.
00:30:14.640 (Applause)
00:30:16.600 And if I hadn't done that,
00:30:18.720 that wasn't on the agenda before.
00:30:21.560 So maybe nothing will happen,but at least the words were said.
00:30:26.680 CA: OK.
00:30:27.920 (Applause)
00:30:31.800 So let's talk SpaceX and Mars.
00:30:35.360 Last time you were here,
00:30:36.840 you spoke about what seemed likea kind of incredibly ambitious dream
00:30:40.560 to develop rocketsthat were actually reusable.
00:30:44.880 And you've only gone and done it.
00:30:47.040 EM: Finally. It took a long time.
00:30:48.680 CA: Talk us through this.What are we looking at here?
00:30:51.280 EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters
00:30:53.440 coming back fromvery high and fast in space.
00:30:58.040 So just delivered the upper stage
00:31:01.320 at high velocity.
00:31:03.440 I think this might have beenat sort of Mach 7 or so,
00:31:07.320 delivery of the upper stage.
00:31:10.880 (Applause)
00:31:13.840 CA: So that was a sped-up --
00:31:15.360 EM: That was the slowed down version.
00:31:17.200 (Laughter)
00:31:18.560 CA: I thought that wasthe sped-up version.
00:31:21.080 But I mean, that's amazing,
00:31:22.440 and several of these failed
00:31:23.800 before you finallyfigured out how to do it,
00:31:26.760 but now you've done this,what, five or six times?
00:31:29.680 EM: We're at eight or nine.
00:31:32.000 CA: And for the first time,
00:31:33.640 you've actually reflownone of the rockets that landed.
00:31:36.800 EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster
00:31:39.600 and then prepped it for flight againand flew it again,
00:31:42.240 so it's the first reflightof an orbital booster
00:31:47.440 where that reflight is relevant.
00:31:49.440 So it's important to appreciatethat reusability is only relevant
00:31:52.640 if it is rapid and complete.
00:31:57.400 So like an aircraft or a car,
00:32:00.680 the reusability is rapid and complete.
00:32:03.080 You do not send your aircraftto Boeing in-between flights.
00:32:08.160 CA: Right. So this is allowing youto dream of this really ambitious idea
00:32:13.000 of sending many, many, many people to Mars
00:32:16.200 in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess.
00:32:18.640 EM: Yeah.
00:32:20.040 CA: And you've designedthis outrageous rocket to do it.
00:32:23.480 Help us understandthe scale of this thing.
00:32:25.920 EM: Well, visuallyyou can see that's a person.
00:32:32.680 Yeah, and that's the vehicle.
00:32:34.520 (Laughter)
00:32:36.200 CA: So if that was a skyscraper,
00:32:37.960 that's like, did I read that,a 40-story skyscraper?
00:32:41.320 EM: Probably a little more, yeah.
00:32:44.360 The thrust level of this is really --
00:32:50.360 This configuration is about four timesthe thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.
00:32:56.440 CA: Four times the thrust of the biggestrocket humanity ever created before.
00:33:01.320 EM: Yeah. Yeah.
00:33:04.640 CA: As one does.EM: Yeah.
00:33:06.120 (Laughter)
00:33:09.120 In units of 747, a 747 is only abouta quarter of a million pounds of thrust,
00:33:15.120 so for every 10 million pounds of thrust,
00:33:18.240 there's 40 747s.
00:33:19.960 So this would be the thrust equivalentof 120 747s, with all engines blazing.
00:33:26.240 CA: And so even with a machinedesigned to escape Earth's gravity,
00:33:30.480 I think you told me last time
00:33:31.920 this thing could actuallytake a fully loaded 747,
00:33:35.200 people, cargo, everything,
00:33:37.560 into orbit.
00:33:38.840 EM: Exactly. This can takea fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel,
00:33:44.000 maximum passengers,maximum cargo on the 747 --
00:33:48.520 this can take it as cargo.
00:33:52.080 CA: So based on this,
00:33:53.840 you presented recentlythis Interplanetary Transport System
00:33:58.680 which is visualized this way.
00:34:02.080 This is a scene you picture in, what,30 years time? 20 years time?
00:34:06.880 People walking into this rocket.
00:34:09.480 EM: I'm hopeful it's sort ofan eight- to 10-year time frame.
00:34:14.080 Aspirationally, that's our target.
00:34:16.480 Our internal targetsare more aggressive, but I think --
00:34:19.520 (Laughter)
00:34:23.600 CA: OK.
00:34:24.840 EM: While vehicle seems quite large
00:34:27.000 and is large by comparisonwith other rockets,
00:34:29.199 I think the future spacecraft
00:34:33.199 will make this look like a rowboat.
00:34:38.320 The future spaceshipswill be truly enormous.
00:34:43.040 CA: Why, Elon?
00:34:45.239 Why do we need to build a city on Mars
00:34:49.400 with a million peopleon it in your lifetime,
00:34:52.480 which I think is kind ofwhat you've said you'd love to do?
00:34:56.480 EM: I think it's important to have
00:35:01.120 a future that is inspiring and appealing.
00:35:03.880 I just think there have to be reasons
00:35:06.679 that you get up in the morningand you want to live.
00:35:09.640 Like, why do you want to live?
00:35:11.120 What's the point? What inspires you?
00:35:12.880 What do you love about the future?
00:35:14.760 And if we're not out there,
00:35:16.280 if the future does not includebeing out there among the stars
00:35:20.320 and being a multiplanet species,
00:35:22.040 I find that it's incredibly depressing
00:35:24.560 if that's not the futurethat we're going to have.
00:35:27.920 (Applause)
00:35:32.120 CA: People want to position thisas an either or,
00:35:34.480 that there are so many desperate thingshappening on the planet now
00:35:38.200 from climate to povertyto, you know, you pick your issue.
00:35:42.480 And this feels like a distraction.
00:35:45.040 You shouldn't be thinking about this.
00:35:46.880 You should be solving what's here and now.
00:35:49.080 And to be fair, you've donea fair old bit to actually do that
00:35:52.040 with your work on sustainable energy.
00:35:54.880 But why not just do that?
00:35:59.360 EM: I think there's --
00:36:04.840 I look at the futurefrom the standpoint of probabilities.
00:36:09.280 It's like a branchingstream of probabilities,
00:36:13.480 and there are actions that we can takethat affect those probabilities
00:36:19.920 or that accelerate one thingor slow down another thing.
00:36:24.000 I may introduce something newto the probability stream.
00:36:30.840 Sustainable energywill happen no matter what.
00:36:33.040 If there was no Tesla,if Tesla never existed,
00:36:35.560 it would have to happen out of necessity.
00:36:38.440 It's tautological.
00:36:40.040 If you don't have sustainable energy,it means you have unsustainable energy.
00:36:43.720 Eventually you will run out,
00:36:45.360 and the laws of economicswill drive civilization
00:36:51.200 towards sustainable energy,
00:36:52.880 inevitably.
00:36:54.120 The fundamental valueof a company like Tesla
00:36:57.120 is the degree to which it acceleratesthe advent of sustainable energy,
00:37:01.560 faster than it would otherwise occur.
00:37:05.120 So when I think, like,
00:37:06.360 what is the fundamental goodof a company like Tesla,
00:37:09.120 I would say, hopefully,
00:37:10.840 if it accelerated that by a decade,potentially more than a decade,
00:37:16.480 that would be quite a good thing to occur.
00:37:18.640 That's what I consider to be
00:37:20.280 the fundamentalaspirational good of Tesla.
00:37:25.480 Then there's becoming a multiplanetspecies and space-faring civilization.
00:37:31.840 This is not inevitable.
00:37:33.800 It's very important to appreciatethis is not inevitable.
00:37:36.520 The sustainable energy futureI think is largely inevitable,
00:37:39.640 but being a space-faring civilizationis definitely not inevitable.
00:37:44.400 If you look at the progress in space,
00:37:48.600 in 1969 you were ableto send somebody to the moon.
00:37:52.040 1969.
00:37:54.840 Then we had the Space Shuttle.
00:37:57.760 The Space Shuttle could onlytake people to low Earth orbit.
00:38:01.200 Then the Space Shuttle retired,
00:38:02.760 and the United Statescould take no one to orbit.
00:38:06.320 So that's the trend.
00:38:07.600 The trend is like down to nothing.
00:38:11.560 People are mistaken when they think
00:38:13.960 that technologyjust automatically improves.
00:38:16.080 It does not automatically improve.
00:38:18.000 It only improves if a lot of peoplework very hard to make it better,
00:38:22.680 and actually it will, I think,by itself degrade, actually.
00:38:28.480 You look at great civilizationslike Ancient Egypt,
00:38:30.920 and they were able to make the pyramids,
00:38:32.880 and they forgot how to do that.
00:38:34.720 And then the Romans,they built these incredible aqueducts.
00:38:37.560 They forgot how to do it.
00:38:40.720 CA: Elon, it almost seems,listening to you
00:38:42.800 and looking at the differentthings you've done,
00:38:45.080 that you've got this uniquedouble motivation on everything
00:38:47.880 that I find so interesting.
00:38:51.720 One is this desire to workfor humanity's long-term good.
00:38:56.320 The other is the desireto do something exciting.
00:38:58.680 And often it feels like you feellike you need the one to drive the other.
00:39:03.400 With Tesla, you wantto have sustainable energy,
00:39:06.520 so you made these super sexy,exciting cars to do it.
00:39:11.080 Solar energy, we need to get there,
00:39:12.800 so we need to make these beautiful roofs.
00:39:14.777 We haven't even spokenabout your newest thing,
00:39:17.000 which we don't have time to do,
00:39:18.560 but you want to save humanity from bad AI,
00:39:20.920 and so you're going to createthis really cool brain-machine interface
00:39:24.240 to give us all infinite memoryand telepathy and so forth.
00:39:28.120 And on Mars, it feelslike what you're saying is,
00:39:30.840 yeah, we need to save humanity
00:39:34.560 and have a backup plan,
00:39:35.960 but also we need to inspire humanity,
00:39:39.240 and this is a way to inspire.
00:39:45.680 EM: I think the valueof beauty and inspiration
00:39:49.480 is very much underrated,
00:39:51.480 no question.
00:39:53.080 But I want to be clear.
00:39:54.360 I'm not trying to be anyone's savior.
00:39:56.200 That is not the --
00:39:58.240 I'm just trying to think about the future
00:40:02.040 and not be sad.
00:40:04.400 (Applause)
00:40:06.520 CA: Beautiful statement.
00:40:10.200 I think everyone here would agree
00:40:11.800 that it is not --
00:40:13.800 None of this is goingto happen inevitably.
00:40:15.880 The fact that in your mind,you dream this stuff,
00:40:19.560 you dream stuff that no one elsewould dare dream,
00:40:22.160 or no one elsewould be capable of dreaming
00:40:24.840 at the level of complexity that you do.
00:40:28.520 The fact that you do that, Elon Musk,is a really remarkable thing.
00:40:31.720 Thank you for helping us allto dream a bit bigger.
00:40:34.440 EM: But you'll tell me if it everstarts getting genuinely insane, right?
00:40:37.960 (Laughter)
00:40:40.480 CA: Thank you, Elon Musk.That was really, really fantastic.
00:40:43.600 That was really fantastic.
00:40:45.040 (Applause)
