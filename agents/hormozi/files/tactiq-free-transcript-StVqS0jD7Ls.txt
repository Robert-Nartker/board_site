00:00:00.040 over the last 13 years I've personally
00:00:01.880 closed 4,000 sales and these are the six
00:00:05.359 elements of The Ultimate Sales blueprint
00:00:08.920 so let's begin with sales multipliers
00:00:11.160 these things right off the bat will make
00:00:12.599 you more money first sales multiplier
00:00:15.279 sell 7even
00:00:17.480 days per week now the reason this is so
00:00:21.760 important is that a lot of business
00:00:23.960 owners want to make more money in their
00:00:25.960 business a lot of sales people want to
00:00:27.240 close more sales but they only choose to
00:00:29.400 close days a week but the interesting
00:00:31.880 thing is that and depending on the
00:00:33.440 industry sometimes the off hours from
00:00:35.640 like 5:00 p.m. onwards is when the most
00:00:38.239 of your prospects are available so like
00:00:40.399 in Fitness where I came from I closed
00:00:42.399 all my sales from 4: until 8:00 p.m. and
00:00:45.200 so if you're like well I only want to
00:00:46.840 work between 9 to 5: it's like well
00:00:49.000 guess what no one's going to buy during
00:00:51.079 that time and so you can probably close
00:00:53.079 more sales in the back at the day uh and
00:00:56.280 on Saturdays and Sundays than you would
00:00:58.199 during the normal 9 to5 so is especially
00:01:00.800 true in like retail and businesses where
00:01:03.280 you sell to Consumers who work normal
00:01:05.760 jobs and you have to sell basically on
00:01:07.560 the times that they're available so sell
00:01:10.280 during the weekends the other piece of
00:01:12.240 selling seven days a week is like
00:01:13.520 there's actual math behind this and so
00:01:15.720 there's 52 weeks a year and so if you
00:01:18.119 have 52 weeks per year times two days
00:01:21.759 right is 104 days of sales extra per
00:01:25.240 year which is 29% increase over just
00:01:29.520 selling 5 days a week and so if you want
00:01:32.840 to immediately increase your sales by
00:01:35.000 29% sell on weekends and I know I've
00:01:37.520 tried to sell you on this but I'm going
00:01:38.759 to give you one more really good reason
00:01:40.439 to sell over the weekend if you've ever
00:01:42.640 tried to book sales and skip the
00:01:45.399 weekends so you've got Friday here and
00:01:47.600 then you've got Saturday and then Sunday
00:01:50.119 and then Monday right and so you skip
00:01:52.320 these days and so then this Monday gets
00:01:54.719 stacked right you have all these people
00:01:56.840 who are saying like oh man um I'm going
00:01:58.680 to show up so your sales guys get
00:02:00.079 they're like oh dude Monday looks big
00:02:01.840 but as soon as Monday happens it's no
00:02:03.759 show no show no show no show reschedule
00:02:06.320 and you're like what the hell well you
00:02:08.199 didn't make it available at the time
00:02:10.560 when they wanted to actually come which
00:02:12.599 is Saturday and Sunday that's when they
00:02:14.120 clicked on the ad that's when they
00:02:16.280 actually made the booking and believe it
00:02:17.640 or not from a lot of our portfolio
00:02:18.720 companies we get more people who
00:02:20.280 actually schedule on Saturdays and
00:02:22.200 Sundays for Monday which means that they
00:02:23.879 are available right then to buy cuz
00:02:26.879 they've got time and so when you do it
00:02:29.680 this way not only do you sell two more
00:02:32.319 days per week which is 104 days more per
00:02:35.640 year which is 29% increase in Revenue
00:02:38.480 that assumes just a flat increase but if
00:02:42.000 you pull up the appointments from Monday
00:02:44.120 to Saturday when they scheduled and
00:02:45.519 Sunday when they scheduled you then get
00:02:47.519 same day next day showup rates which
00:02:49.400 your showup rates also go up on those
00:02:51.760 days so not only do you schedule more
00:02:53.519 people because it only works for sat
00:02:55.319 them on Saturday and Sunday and they
00:02:56.440 didn't want to do Monday you also get
00:02:58.200 higher show up rates on Saturday and
00:02:59.640 Sunday for the people who wanted to
00:03:01.239 schedule then because that was when it
00:03:02.560 was convenient for them and so you get a
00:03:04.799 multiplier effect across the entire
00:03:07.080 business of sales by simply adding two
00:03:09.840 more days in a year so it's minimum 29%
00:03:12.840 sometimes more next up respond to leads
00:03:15.959 in less than one minute now you may not
00:03:20.080 know the stats on this some of the more
00:03:21.599 experienced salespeople do if you can
00:03:23.799 contact a lead within 60 seconds of them
00:03:26.040 showing interest or opting in or giving
00:03:28.319 you their contact information you have a
00:03:31.000 391 per increase in the likelihood that
00:03:34.360 you can close the Prospect and so that
00:03:37.000 means that if you did nothing else but
00:03:39.760 simply put the processes in place so
00:03:42.720 that you can contact leads within 60
00:03:44.680 seconds you could 4X your business
00:03:48.640 tomorrow and so then you have to ask the
00:03:50.879 question what are all these other things
00:03:52.920 that I'm spending my time on and do
00:03:55.040 those things have an immediate 4X
00:03:57.319 increase in my business if the answer no
00:04:00.720 then you should probably stop doing
00:04:02.480 those things and do this one obvious
00:04:04.879 thing that can increase your business to
00:04:07.439 such a large degree also 50% of
00:04:11.000 prospects will go with the business that
00:04:12.439 response to them first not the one who's
00:04:15.439 best that they did the most research for
00:04:17.680 simply the one that responds them first
00:04:19.320 and I remember when Lila was we were out
00:04:22.040 of town we were scheduling some or she
00:04:23.560 was scheduling something for her hair or
00:04:24.880 whatever and she went to a salon and she
00:04:27.199 called them and she said hey are you
00:04:28.960 available right now to take me and
00:04:30.120 they're like no we're only appointment
00:04:31.160 only and she said cool hung up called
00:04:33.440 the next one she's like are you
00:04:34.360 available to take me now they said no
00:04:36.280 hung up next one they answered and she
00:04:39.080 and they said yes we can take you in
00:04:40.360 right now they're the ones who got the
00:04:42.000 business and here's the crazy part is
00:04:43.520 the first two owners maybe they're like
00:04:45.440 I don't know why customers aren't com
00:04:47.080 you didn't make it convenient for them
00:04:49.360 right and so the thing is is that people
00:04:51.199 have huge motivation for a tiny period
00:04:53.800 of time and when they knock on the door
00:04:55.680 in that tiny period of time you want to
00:04:57.560 open it and welcome them in and like
00:05:00.039 okay Alex but you know one minute's a
00:05:01.840 lot well totally and if you do greater
00:05:05.000 than five minutes the likelihood that
00:05:07.160 you close them drops by 80% which means
00:05:10.720 four out of five times you would have
00:05:13.160 closed now goes to 20% close rate on
00:05:16.440 those leads and so the whole idea that
00:05:19.000 people think that the lead quality is go
00:05:20.560 down is not really true it's completely
00:05:24.319 dependent on how well you work the leads
00:05:26.720 now a lot of people like to talk about
00:05:28.280 follow-up and follow- Up's important
00:05:30.039 right you got to make it personal you
00:05:31.400 got to make it fast you want to do it
00:05:32.800 multiple times over multiple days for
00:05:35.120 sure but one of the most important
00:05:37.680 follow-ups is the first followup which
00:05:40.000 is how quickly you can show them that
00:05:42.720 you have received their interest and are
00:05:44.440 ready to help them and customers will
00:05:46.160 make a judgment on how good your
00:05:48.440 business is how buttoned up you are by
00:05:50.840 how quickly you respond so if you reach
00:05:52.919 out to a company just imagine for a
00:05:54.440 second you opt into something and then
00:05:56.120 within 5 Seconds your phone rings and
00:05:57.919 someone's like hey saw that you asked
00:05:59.319 for more information about this how can
00:06:01.120 I help you right and right there you're
00:06:03.639 like man these guys are on top of it it
00:06:05.960 makes it judgment that you cast over the
00:06:07.759 entire business that first impression
00:06:09.520 it's the tip of the spear and most
00:06:11.440 people are missing out so all the data
00:06:13.720 that I will cite in this video will come
00:06:15.599 from two sources so one is there was a
00:06:17.360 Harvard Business Review uh that did a
00:06:19.080 huge case study on different sales
00:06:20.759 metrics across massive Industries and
00:06:22.759 then me personally won Allen and so a
00:06:24.919 lot of the lead nurture stats are
00:06:26.240 related to Allen which is a software
00:06:27.520 company that we own uh which is like
00:06:28.960 4,000 plus appointments per day and so
00:06:31.240 we could see how changing scheduling and
00:06:33.800 changing hours per day and things like
00:06:35.440 that affected overall throughput because
00:06:37.560 we could see from click to close and so
00:06:40.039 we could see house opening up calendars
00:06:42.800 was the single strongest correlate to
00:06:45.599 overall throughput more than increasing
00:06:48.240 closing percentages by you know 10% 20%
00:06:51.599 because you couldn't get 400% increases
00:06:54.560 in closing like you can by putting these
00:06:57.240 sales multipliers in that I'm talking
00:06:58.800 about right now these are all the things
00:07:00.280 that happen outside of the sale that
00:07:02.319 affect your sales more than anything
00:07:03.879 that happens inside the sale now the
00:07:06.520 next one in the spirit of all this speed
00:07:08.599 of response is it's good to have someone
00:07:11.879 have the option to schedule but you know
00:07:13.840 what else you can give them call now and
00:07:17.720 so when someone clicks down your funnel
00:07:19.800 and they click over to your schedule or
00:07:21.759 something if you can add a dropdown that
00:07:25.039 says call now because now they're
00:07:27.680 calling you and now the intent could not
00:07:29.680 be stronger now if you're in a business
00:07:31.440 where you're like oh man we have to
00:07:32.520 qualify leads more fine put the call out
00:07:34.520 thing after you've qualified the lead
00:07:37.080 duh right and so just think through how
00:07:40.160 we need to do this and if you're like
00:07:41.479 man I don't have the sales team to
00:07:43.360 support it think about it like this if
00:07:45.800 you can 3x your business or double your
00:07:48.800 business by simply hiring one more sales
00:07:51.440 rep if the relative increase in revenue
00:07:54.680 is significantly greater than the cost
00:07:56.639 of onboarding one more sales rep then
00:07:58.919 you should make that investment so that
00:08:01.360 you can have the coverage for your
00:08:03.720 prospects to call you to give you money
00:08:06.240 all right so let's talk about the next
00:08:07.400 one which is time slots so if you are
00:08:10.319 going to have them Book on a scheduler
00:08:11.840 then how do you set up that schedule a
00:08:13.199 lot of people don't put any time or
00:08:14.840 thought into this now we already covered
00:08:16.400 the seven days a week but what about the
00:08:18.440 actual day layout itself now most people
00:08:21.479 say okay I'm going to have these one
00:08:23.000 hour time slots 1 hour uh you know 1
00:08:26.400 hour whatever now what we found out with
00:08:29.120 Allan
00:08:30.080 is that we could increase the overall
00:08:31.919 schedule rate and show up rate by simply
00:08:34.599 changing how the times appeared on the
00:08:36.159 calendar and so we set this up so that
00:08:38.719 we would have 15 minute slots so you
00:08:41.159 might be thinking how am I going to sell
00:08:42.799 in 15 minutes you're not you allow them
00:08:45.760 to start in 15-minute increments and
00:08:48.000 then we know that the next three blocks
00:08:50.320 are used up and then somebody else books
00:08:52.480 here now some of you might say wait a
00:08:53.880 second that means that some of my sales
00:08:55.839 guys are going to have awkward times in
00:08:57.279 between well there's two solutions one
00:09:00.079 is hire more sales reps number two is
00:09:02.839 you need to have something called an
00:09:04.079 off-the call sop and so you have an
00:09:06.279 onthe call sop which is standard
00:09:07.680 operating procedure which is what do you
00:09:09.160 do when you're on the call of the
00:09:10.240 prospect but if you have a no-show or
00:09:13.000 there's off the call or you don't have
00:09:15.079 somebody on your calendar then you need
00:09:16.480 to have step- by-step of what they need
00:09:18.000 to do when they're not actually on a
00:09:20.560 call and most people only address the on
00:09:22.320 the call and don't address the off the
00:09:23.839 call which is why their sales people
00:09:24.880 aren't nearly as productive and so by
00:09:26.480 doing 15-minute time slots people pick a
00:09:28.680 time that is more convenient for them
00:09:30.920 and so I think on one level because it's
00:09:33.800 more convenient for them it's more
00:09:34.959 precisely convenient they show up at a
00:09:37.519 higher percentage I think the other
00:09:38.920 reason and there's this big
00:09:40.200 misconception about the idea of like no
00:09:41.600 I want to make it look like I'm busy and
00:09:43.000 not have full availability completely
00:09:44.920 dumb it doesn't do anything to literally
00:09:48.160 take up slots that are not true to show
00:09:51.680 that you have traffic it's dumb it just
00:09:54.240 it's dumb I just stop it we've already
00:09:55.920 looked at it it doesn't do anything it
00:09:57.680 just makes it less convenient for your
00:09:58.959 customer to book with you now in the
00:10:01.880 offthe call sop all right what should
00:10:04.760 they be doing then I'll give you the
00:10:06.320 next hack which
00:10:08.360 is you start pulling up appointments so
00:10:11.079 you remember I said we had the Monday
00:10:12.800 Sunday Saturday whatever and people are
00:10:15.200 booking on Saturday for Monday right
00:10:17.120 they're booking here because you didn't
00:10:18.640 put any availability well if you do have
00:10:22.120 your salesperson working and they have
00:10:24.040 an off-the call block where they don't
00:10:26.120 have anything on their calendar what
00:10:27.720 they should be doing is they should be
00:10:29.519 let me see if I can draw a phone here
00:10:30.720 there you go calling these leads and
00:10:33.079 then pulling them up and so when you
00:10:35.399 have that conversation with the prospect
00:10:37.120 the first thing you're doing is
00:10:38.040 qualifying them which you should do
00:10:39.240 anyways with any leads that are on the
00:10:40.519 calendar that are going to take a full
00:10:41.480 sale slot but secondarily when you call
00:10:44.480 them to qualify them say hey I had an
00:10:46.600 opening later today that just opened up
00:10:48.519 do you want the slot and so it takes a
00:10:50.760 three-day out appointment and makes it a
00:10:52.440 same day appointment and anyone who's
00:10:53.760 been in sales knows that same day
00:10:54.880 appointments have way higher SHP rates
00:10:56.880 than future appointments next is is the
00:11:00.200 actual uh person if they can't move it
00:11:03.120 up for whatever reason you still have
00:11:05.440 contacted them within just a few minutes
00:11:06.959 of them opting in so they know that
00:11:08.200 you're legit you've already qualified
00:11:09.800 them and by pulling them off and moving
00:11:12.880 them up if you do have that situation
00:11:14.959 you increase the salesperson's
00:11:17.279 utilization because now their whole
00:11:19.120 calendar has more sales appointments
00:11:20.680 that are stacked fewer Open Spaces which
00:11:22.680 is good and we now have opened up this
00:11:25.440 slot right here so that somebody else
00:11:28.240 can find it convenient and then book in
00:11:30.040 in the future and so by simply changing
00:11:32.440 what people do off the call you increase
00:11:34.480 the sales utilization you increase
00:11:36.839 booking rates and you increase show
00:11:39.160 rates by adding this one thing to what
00:11:40.920 your sales people do when they currently
00:11:42.160 weren't doing anything waiting between
00:11:43.440 calls so the next one is very
00:11:45.600 controversial and a lot of bad sales
00:11:47.600 people are going to be against it but
00:11:48.720 the killers are going to be nodding
00:11:49.720 their head so what you want to do is you
00:11:52.000 want to
00:11:53.160 feed the killers now what does that mean
00:11:58.320 is that the best leads should go to the
00:12:01.240 best closers and the worst leads should
00:12:04.360 go to the worst closers and so you're
00:12:06.279 like wait a second what do you mean my
00:12:08.360 my worst leads go to my work yeah
00:12:10.600 because that means that you have the
00:12:11.920 lowest amount of net waste within the
00:12:13.399 business the people who are the most
00:12:14.959 closable who are the most qualified who
00:12:16.600 have the most money go to the people who
00:12:18.480 have the highest likelihood of closing
00:12:19.839 them for the most money and so I'll tell
00:12:22.519 you a story when I learned this so there
00:12:24.240 was a guy who lives in my building he
00:12:25.560 does like 3 million a year in personal
00:12:27.920 income and
00:12:29.800 he was the number one sales rep or still
00:12:31.680 is the number one sales rep for a time
00:12:33.199 share company that's a multi-billion
00:12:34.440 dollar company he the number one time
00:12:35.360 share company he was the number one
00:12:36.600 sales rep and he's won the best sales
00:12:38.680 rep of the year out of 3,000 sales reps
00:12:41.560 five out of the last six years and so I
00:12:43.240 had dinner with him and I was like so
00:12:44.680 give me give me your give me your
00:12:45.760 strategy he's like you know I won the
00:12:47.720 first year when just with the existing
00:12:49.760 system but then I got to have one hour
00:12:51.600 with the CEO as kind of like the prize
00:12:53.519 for winning best salesman plus you know
00:12:55.920 a check or whatever and I was like okay
00:12:57.920 he said so when I sat down with the CEO
00:13:00.040 I closed him on basically changing the
00:13:02.320 way they allocated leads and he said so
00:13:05.079 they used to just round robin all the
00:13:07.000 leads to all the salespeople and he said
00:13:09.040 when I went to the CEO I said listen
00:13:10.320 you're just throwing money down the
00:13:11.800 toilet you're giving me people that no
00:13:14.240 one has a chance of closing and they're
00:13:16.160 completely unqualified and you're
00:13:17.360 wasting my time and then I see some
00:13:19.519 really qualified person go to a dud
00:13:21.440 closer's office and then he misses it
00:13:23.800 and it's like shoot you should give him
00:13:25.440 my terrible Le is not going to close
00:13:26.680 them anyways and give me the good one
00:13:28.240 and I'll close him and so the CEO
00:13:30.600 decided to test it just with the
00:13:32.320 location that this salesman was at he
00:13:34.600 took his income from $250,000 a year to
00:13:37.440 $3 million a year for him as a Salesman
00:13:40.480 personal income but what was more
00:13:42.639 important is that it 5x the company when
00:13:45.399 they rolled it out Nationwide he
00:13:47.800 increased the total output for that one
00:13:49.680 location by so much that they then
00:13:51.120 rolled it out and so this goes to show
00:13:53.759 that if you're like wait I feel bad
00:13:55.440 about this this is a business decision
00:13:57.320 but if you are worried about your worst
00:13:58.759 Sal people turning out why are you
00:14:01.440 worried about your worst sales to people
00:14:02.639 turning out now the other side of this
00:14:04.800 which is really nice a lot of people
00:14:06.040 don't think about is if your top sales
00:14:08.199 rep can make a million dollar a year or
00:14:11.120 $500,000 a year or $3 million a year do
00:14:13.880 you know the amount of people who will
00:14:15.360 work for nothing for the opportunity to
00:14:17.880 make that kind of money and so what
00:14:19.360 happens is salespeople will come in and
00:14:21.040 work for way below the the normal wage
00:14:24.399 for their skill because they want the
00:14:26.959 shot the opportunity to be top dog and
00:14:30.440 the other piece that this trains for or
00:14:32.600 helps the business out with is that if
00:14:34.759 someone survives this churn Factory of
00:14:37.839 down here where it's really hard for
00:14:40.199 guys to get started because they're
00:14:41.800 getting the worst leads they learn on
00:14:45.160 the hardest people to close and then
00:14:47.800 when they survive and they can still
00:14:49.360 make enough to move up then they get
00:14:52.040 better and better leads but now they
00:14:53.759 have qualified themselves as closers who
00:14:56.360 are worthy of those leads so the next
00:14:59.680 hack actually has again something to do
00:15:01.880 with things around sales but is not
00:15:03.959 sales itself which is most times it's
00:15:07.480 harder to get an entire team to go up by
00:15:10.399 30% in close rates unless you just
00:15:12.320 absolutely suck at sales but there's
00:15:14.560 usually massive opportunities on show up
00:15:17.360 rates and so one of the things that we
00:15:19.279 do is we give kudos or
00:15:22.320 shoutouts to the closers who have the
00:15:25.279 highest show up rates and so by calling
00:15:29.079 those people out we draw attention to
00:15:31.279 how show up rates are very important to
00:15:32.880 the business because if I had to give
00:15:34.279 you an option hey would you rather
00:15:35.920 increase your close rates by 20% or
00:15:38.319 increase your show rates by 20% Which
00:15:40.680 would you choose well if you're a smart
00:15:42.880 business owner you'd say Well they're
00:15:44.040 the same thing yes so then the followup
00:15:46.319 question is which one's more likely
00:15:47.800 given the stats you're at if your guys
00:15:49.720 are closing at 35% for you to get a 20%
00:15:52.560 boost might be very very difficult but
00:15:54.920 for you to just simply remind them to
00:15:56.480 work their leads and follow up with
00:15:58.040 their appointments might be very easy
00:16:00.519 and so you shout out the closers who
00:16:02.519 have the highest Strow rates every week
00:16:03.959 not just highest close rates and then
00:16:06.399 you ask them what they did and they're
00:16:08.040 probably going to say I just followed
00:16:09.759 the process and then you're going to say
00:16:11.839 that's awesome great job and if you want
00:16:14.240 you can give an extra kudos for the guy
00:16:15.880 who has the highest show up rate you can
00:16:17.480 give him like you know a $500 flat thing
00:16:19.399 per week whatever something that makes
00:16:21.440 it material enough that it's worth
00:16:23.199 showing off for but I'm telling you this
00:16:26.000 can increase your overall sales in your
00:16:27.600 business more than sales training can
00:16:30.279 sometimes and so if you're listening to
00:16:32.199 that you might be like okay well what is
00:16:33.920 the best reminder sequence for people to
00:16:36.440 show up now the first thing is is you
00:16:38.440 want to have your automated reminders
00:16:40.040 set up right those have to be done and
00:16:42.880 the thing is is and I think a lot of
00:16:44.199 people make this mistake is you want to
00:16:46.319 to look automated don't try and pretend
00:16:49.000 that automation is a real person
00:16:50.519 everyone knows and it looks like so
00:16:52.000 don't do it all right but on top of
00:16:54.560 automation you layer manual now manual
00:16:58.360 you don't have to nearly as much to make
00:16:59.959 it effective and hopefully I'm spelling
00:17:01.199 manual right all right and so there's
00:17:03.079 three times that we have S this is from
00:17:04.919 Allen that we know that gets the highest
00:17:06.640 show upates all right very simple 24
00:17:08.919 hours before all right then am and then
00:17:13.439 1 hour all right and so think about it
00:17:15.559 like this it's like you have your
00:17:16.400 automated ones until the night before
00:17:18.839 and someone says hey just making sure
00:17:20.720 that we're on for tomorrow very excited
00:17:22.240 I did this personalized thing for you
00:17:24.240 and so you want to show that you did
00:17:25.599 some sort of prep for the prospect so
00:17:28.039 they know you've put some effort in and
00:17:29.600 so they would feel worse about not
00:17:30.919 showing because you show that you've got
00:17:32.640 a whole bunch of work that you want to
00:17:33.799 show them on that call and so whether
00:17:36.520 you're a weight loss you know business
00:17:38.440 it's like hey I set aside this t-shirt
00:17:39.919 for you what size do you want or what
00:17:41.720 color do you want for when you come in
00:17:43.559 would be something that you could do for
00:17:45.320 a weight loss customer if you're a B2B
00:17:46.720 customer it's like hey I already I
00:17:48.240 looked over your site we already uh I
00:17:49.880 talked to my team about it it looks like
00:17:51.039 we've got three things we can
00:17:51.799 immediately help you with very excited
00:17:53.000 to share what we found like it takes 5
00:17:55.000 minutes to do that but if you can
00:17:56.840 increase your show up rate by 30%
00:17:58.960 because you do that makes a lot of sense
00:18:01.840 right in 60 minutes you can increase
00:18:03.240 your closure your total sales througha
00:18:05.080 by 30% once a day feels like it's worth
00:18:07.400 it now that's night before morning of
00:18:10.000 you think you're a prospect right you're
00:18:11.080 like okay yeah sounds good morning of
00:18:12.720 you start and your whole day is blank
00:18:14.200 because you forgot everything from the
00:18:15.480 day before and so the morning it's like
00:18:17.120 hey just reminder again I'm seeing you
00:18:18.880 later this afternoon and they're like
00:18:20.360 yep I'm in cool and then one hour before
00:18:23.520 they're busy during the day and you're
00:18:24.679 like yo a meeting with you in 60 minutes
00:18:26.559 just making sure now for these I prefer
00:18:29.039 to have uh blue messages is what we call
00:18:31.159 them but basically the IM messages
00:18:32.960 whenever possible rather than the green
00:18:34.320 ones because people still don't entirely
00:18:36.280 believe uh that it's a real person and
00:18:38.400 so this is where having uh voice voice
00:18:40.559 memos uh and video work really well for
00:18:43.360 those reminders in addition to the
00:18:44.760 things that you're doing at the 24-hour
00:18:46.559 Mark that show personalization so it
00:18:48.480 would be something like this hey John
00:18:50.640 really excited to meet with you tomorrow
00:18:52.200 we outlined six things for your business
00:18:54.120 that I think would really help you out
00:18:56.000 I'm very excited to share them with you
00:18:57.640 these were things that I pulled from my
00:18:58.840 team and just from looking at the site
00:19:00.679 uh before we get on the call so stoked
00:19:02.760 we're at 4:00 tomorrow hit me up if
00:19:04.840 there's any issues or you have any
00:19:06.080 problems getting on otherwise I'll see
00:19:07.400 you then next one is Logistics in terms
00:19:10.200 of how you schedule Andor your policies
00:19:12.600 which is we like to do same day next
00:19:15.600 day period in terms of our availability
00:19:18.240 now the reason for that is because show
00:19:21.320 up rates are higher same day next day
00:19:24.440 and so if we constrain people to those
00:19:26.559 days we increase the show up rates now
00:19:28.840 the key and this is where most people
00:19:30.200 mess up is that they're like well if I
00:19:31.720 did same day next day I'm not going to
00:19:32.760 be able to book all my appointments that
00:19:34.000 means you need to hire more sales people
00:19:35.840 and when you do that you'll get more
00:19:37.000 shows which then means you close more
00:19:38.480 sales so those are some immediate things
00:19:41.039 that you can do to multiply your sales
00:19:42.960 without even having to learn anything
00:19:44.679 more about what you have to say on the
00:19:46.360 phone or even getting good at sales
00:19:49.000 itself these are all the things you do
00:19:50.159 around sales that still close way more
00:19:52.400 sales than anything you can actually do
00:19:54.520 on the call but once you do get on the
00:19:57.039 call you should make sure that your guy
00:19:58.919 or you yourself don't suck so let's talk
00:20:01.120 about sales training so now that we've
00:20:02.640 covered sales multipliers now let's talk
00:20:04.480 about sales training making it happen so
00:20:06.679 I'm going to cover daily huddles one-on
00:20:08.799 ones gam tape review role playing and CS
00:20:12.880 gam tape weekly reviews all right you're
00:20:14.760 feel like I don't know what any of those
00:20:15.720 are that's why I made this video and
00:20:16.960 I'll break them down so number one is
00:20:19.280 most people have no idea what they're
00:20:21.200 doing when they're training sales so the
00:20:22.440 vast majority of sales organizations
00:20:24.280 don't even know how to train them at all
00:20:26.480 and simply just run shurn factories so
00:20:28.799 they say you know we'll bring 100 people
00:20:30.520 in we'll see who survives which fine but
00:20:33.679 if you know how to train sales as a
00:20:36.159 business owner you can compensate below
00:20:39.480 Market because you can take someone
00:20:42.000 who's not good and make them good rather
00:20:44.760 than relying on people to come in with
00:20:46.520 existing skills and so that is the
00:20:48.240 Arbitrage opportunity that you get to
00:20:49.880 have as a business owner and so if
00:20:51.520 someone comes in with no skills and then
00:20:52.840 you give them a lot of skills they come
00:20:54.240 in at that Baseline right now I'm not
00:20:56.720 saying that uh sales people shouldn't
00:20:58.480 make make a lot of money they should uh
00:21:00.760 but it's all based on the marketplace if
00:21:02.840 you have 10 times bigger audience that
00:21:04.799 you can take sales people from then
00:21:06.240 that's an advantage that you have
00:21:07.520 compared to your other businesses on the
00:21:09.440 marketplace of sales skills so the first
00:21:12.600 thing that we do is we like to have
00:21:14.200 daily huddles and so daily huddles are
00:21:16.880 where we do role playing now role
00:21:20.200 playing is probably the single greatest
00:21:23.159 skill that you need to learn in sales
00:21:25.640 and the big thing I'll give you as a
00:21:26.720 caveat is every entrepreneur or sales
00:21:29.000 managers always afraid of looking bad or
00:21:31.200 not being able to close something uh in
00:21:33.000 front of their team and so they they shy
00:21:34.960 away from doing role playing but you
00:21:36.679 need to set the frame up front which is
00:21:38.320 no one's perfect that's why we practice
00:21:40.440 and so I'm going to mess up you're going
00:21:41.640 to catch me and it's fine right because
00:21:43.919 if you have any ego around this you will
00:21:46.559 not do it as much because you'll be
00:21:47.960 afraid of looking stupid in front of
00:21:49.320 your team so just get over that as fast
00:21:51.760 as humanly possible now when you're
00:21:53.480 doing these daily huddles you want to do
00:21:55.480 the role playing so the role playing the
00:21:57.080 important part of role playing is you
00:21:59.559 actually have to get into it with them
00:22:03.120 and give Fast
00:22:04.880 feedback now here's how not to do it so
00:22:08.520 and this is how most people do it which
00:22:10.320 is someone goes through the script and
00:22:12.520 they give not real answers anyways and
00:22:14.279 then they say okay at the end of the 30
00:22:16.480 minutes or 20 minutes they say do this
00:22:18.279 different do that different do this
00:22:19.960 different do that different so two
00:22:21.840 massive problems number one is that you
00:22:24.640 have to give one piece of feedback at a
00:22:27.000 time people can't handle multiple piece
00:22:28.720 feedback so it's not going to work
00:22:31.120 second is that the trainability of a
00:22:34.000 person or really an organism because
00:22:35.720 this actually happens across species is
00:22:37.880 inversely correlated with how fast you
00:22:39.520 get feedback and so basically the number
00:22:42.320 of times that you have to uh give
00:22:46.480 feedback to an organism is inverted with
00:22:50.919 how quickly so one second 2 second 3
00:22:53.679 second whatever now this is an
00:22:54.880 exaggeration but this would be number of
00:22:57.039 times so that means that if I say Hey
00:22:59.679 try it like this and then they can't do
00:23:02.279 it again and then I have to say try it
00:23:04.240 like this and then they still can't do
00:23:05.960 it and then I say try it like this the
00:23:08.000 faster I do it the fewer times I have to
00:23:10.120 repeat myself before they get it and so
00:23:12.760 this is why speed is so important for
00:23:15.360 training this actually happens across
00:23:16.960 human you know across the entire
00:23:18.360 organization but specifically for sales
00:23:20.720 so when someone does the role play the
00:23:22.600 sales manager or the other person's only
00:23:24.240 working on one thing and when they begin
00:23:26.799 the sale they say this is what we're
00:23:28.080 working on
00:23:28.960 and then they start the role play and
00:23:31.240 then as soon as they mess up or do a
00:23:35.080 good job which both those are happening
00:23:36.559 in real time all the time you say great
00:23:39.000 keep going great keep going and so they
00:23:42.000 keep talking and they can see you
00:23:43.360 nodding your head they can see you
00:23:44.760 giving thumbs up and you can hear you
00:23:46.400 saying great and so you have three or
00:23:47.880 four different ways that you can give
00:23:49.000 positive reinforcement in real time so
00:23:51.080 that you can train them on the right
00:23:52.600 thing to say now when they do mess up
00:23:54.360 you also set the frame beforehand saying
00:23:56.400 listen I'm going to probably stop you 30
00:23:57.960 or 40 times times during you just trying
00:23:59.840 to say this one script that's okay
00:24:02.520 that's to be expected that means we're
00:24:04.240 doing it right and so if you set that
00:24:05.960 expectation people aren't thrown off
00:24:07.360 guard if you don't they're going to
00:24:08.679 think that they're just doing a horrible
00:24:09.919 job which is not what you want to do and
00:24:11.440 so they go through and you're like
00:24:12.799 awesome great job M keep it going pause
00:24:16.960 say it like this try it again great try
00:24:20.600 it
00:24:21.400 again great try it again and so once
00:24:24.320 someone properly does the right way of
00:24:27.240 saying it you don't just say great they
00:24:29.120 did it once you have them do it two
00:24:31.440 three four five six times in quick
00:24:33.640 succession so that it drills it in so
00:24:36.679 that when they actually are on a sales
00:24:38.279 call it's like this little mini recorder
00:24:40.039 plays and they remember when they to
00:24:41.640 drill it so many times in a row and from
00:24:44.799 a sales training perspective you want to
00:24:46.520 be working with them on one thing
00:24:48.480 sometimes for a week or two weeks all
00:24:50.200 right so it's not a big deal now daily
00:24:52.520 huddles you're usually working with the
00:24:54.240 team on something like as a team we're
00:24:56.799 struggling with this and so as a team
00:24:58.600 we're going to be drilling this on
00:25:03.399 101's it's one thing and it's going to
00:25:06.520 be specific to that person now the
00:25:08.840 reason that most sales managers do a bad
00:25:10.640 job sales training is because it's a
00:25:12.159 full-time job like you have to listen to
00:25:14.720 sales recordings you have to see what
00:25:16.720 they're messing up you have to take
00:25:18.360 notes and then when you meet with them
00:25:19.919 one-on-one you have to see all 28 things
00:25:22.480 you think they did wrong and say which
00:25:23.840 of these 28 things is going to create
00:25:26.120 the highest Improvement in their close
00:25:28.320 closing rate and then say we're only
00:25:31.080 going to prioritize this one thing so it
00:25:33.640 may be like they just don't know how to
00:25:35.120 ask for the card smoothly it may be that
00:25:36.760 they don't know how to set the agenda
00:25:38.000 well on the call it may be that they
00:25:39.760 lose the frame somewhere during the sale
00:25:41.600 it may be that they're getting lost in
00:25:42.840 the weeds when someone asks detail based
00:25:44.840 questions that they don't know how to
00:25:45.760 zoom out like these are all different
00:25:47.440 skills that a good salesman should know
00:25:49.200 how to do in a sale and you can only
00:25:51.760 focus on one of them so I'll give you
00:25:54.200 another one which is your best
00:25:56.760 closer usually
00:25:59.200 isn't your sales manager all right and
00:26:04.200 so this is a mistake that I've made
00:26:05.399 multiple times in my life and it's
00:26:07.000 because typically the best closers are
00:26:08.720 very like Hunter type person um and
00:26:11.399 there's nothing wrong with that I mean
00:26:12.640 hey that's what makes the world go
00:26:13.960 around um but often times they're not
00:26:16.960 like super like leadership oriented
00:26:20.520 patient willing to uh continue to invest
00:26:23.360 in teammates like they just want to
00:26:24.679 close deals and so most times most
00:26:28.279 closers that I've had in our businesses
00:26:29.799 before I explain this to them they're
00:26:31.320 like I want to be sales manager somay
00:26:32.760 and I'm like do you know what the
00:26:34.039 day-to-day of a sales manager is because
00:26:35.720 it's not just like oh this makes me more
00:26:37.320 money it's your entire activities that
00:26:40.159 you do all the things you love about
00:26:41.520 this job are now going to stop and be a
00:26:43.760 whole new set of things and so sometimes
00:26:46.600 the best closers it's kind of like
00:26:47.880 coaches it's like it's not the best
00:26:50.279 players who sometimes make the best
00:26:51.679 coaches sometimes it's like mediocre or
00:26:54.000 bad players who just learned how to be
00:26:56.360 decent or good not the best best who
00:26:59.039 actually make the best coaches and so I
00:27:01.919 set this stage what I said earlier which
00:27:04.120 is like the sales manager has to have no
00:27:06.000 egoo and can set the stage which is like
00:27:07.760 hey some of you guys are better than me
00:27:09.399 at sales like and so for example Phil
00:27:11.480 Jackson is not better than Michael
00:27:13.440 Jordan or kobby Bryant at basketball but
00:27:16.880 they respected when he gave them
00:27:18.559 feedback on their work and so I would
00:27:20.720 even use that as a sales manager to set
00:27:23.000 the stage was like I hope that you guys
00:27:24.600 are better than me at sales because
00:27:26.399 that's what you have to do every day you
00:27:27.840 just make not be better than me at
00:27:29.320 helping other people get better at sales
00:27:31.080 and so these are different skills and
00:27:32.399 it's totally okay and so when I roleplay
00:27:34.120 with you if you smash me that's awesome
00:27:35.760 that's fine if Phil Jackson went
00:27:37.120 one-onone with MJ he's gon to get
00:27:38.679 destroyed every time that's fine my goal
00:27:40.679 is that this team crushes as a team the
00:27:43.960 next one that a lot of people don't
00:27:45.440 understand is about competition all
00:27:47.720 right now I think competition is very
00:27:49.760 good but not in the way that you think
00:27:51.480 it is so I used to be really hardcore
00:27:54.039 and Cutthroat about I wanted all my
00:27:55.640 teams you know the guys to compete like
00:27:57.559 you know let the let the winners win
00:27:59.159 losers lose Etc and I do but in a
00:28:01.519 different way so I don't want it to be
00:28:04.120 us versus ourselves I want the
00:28:06.679 competition to be us versus them so you
00:28:09.679 need to pick a big enemy and it doesn't
00:28:11.360 even have to mean that you actually are
00:28:12.760 enemies with this person it could be a
00:28:14.039 rival or friend ofy whatever you want
00:28:15.919 and say listen every customer that we're
00:28:18.320 not selling they're selling and so we
00:28:21.880 want to beat them right the reason that
00:28:24.399 you know the us could get to the moon
00:28:25.600 first because we were trying to beat the
00:28:26.679 Russians right like having uh a common
00:28:28.960 enemy is a great thing to align the
00:28:31.720 troops towards achieving a big goal and
00:28:35.159 it kind of quells the inner conflict of
00:28:38.080 the team but if everyone's trying to
00:28:39.799 Edge each other out it creates a culture
00:28:42.200 that in my opinion doesn't actually make
00:28:44.640 the most total sales you'll definitely
00:28:46.720 have people who thrive in those ultra
00:28:49.080 competitive environments but you will
00:28:50.799 lose people who otherwise would have
00:28:52.480 been good closers in a team environment
00:28:54.960 another amazing sales training piece
00:28:57.600 that we like to do in our companies is
00:29:00.080 gam tape review so first off you
00:29:02.279 absolutely need to be recording every
00:29:04.480 single call that happens to the customer
00:29:06.080 across the company across the life cycle
00:29:07.760 of the customer if you're not doing that
00:29:08.919 you should do it please do it now stop
00:29:10.600 the video go do this now all right now
00:29:12.519 assuming you are recording all calls
00:29:15.559 this is something that completely
00:29:16.679 changed my business forever was getting
00:29:19.960 sales and
00:29:22.200 Cs on the same call every
00:29:25.159 week to review the game tape and so
00:29:29.039 you're like why would you review sales
00:29:31.360 game tape with customer success on the
00:29:34.039 call well because then you can say hey
00:29:36.799 guys when you say it this way they
00:29:38.399 expect this and it's really bad for the
00:29:40.600 business and so what it does is actually
00:29:42.279 elevates both teams to a larger
00:29:44.159 perspective so they understand that like
00:29:46.200 when if you ever have conflict where CS
00:29:47.720 is like sales is over promising and
00:29:49.360 sales is like CS stop being such babies
00:29:51.399 and just do stuff right like we're the
00:29:53.279 ones who make the money like everyone
00:29:54.679 gets it we've all been there and so the
00:29:56.919 idea is when you get the them both on
00:29:58.480 the same call one of the other nice
00:30:00.399 things is that you then review an
00:30:01.919 onboarding call most salesp people have
00:30:04.320 never seen an onboarding call they've
00:30:06.120 been selling for you for three years
00:30:07.720 five years and they literally have no
00:30:09.559 idea what happens after they click
00:30:10.840 submit or they run the card or they send
00:30:12.840 the invoice over to finance and then
00:30:14.200 they get the car you know the approval
00:30:15.559 for their commission they're like all
00:30:17.679 right next Prospect and that's fine but
00:30:20.480 they have to understand kind of the
00:30:21.799 larger life cycle of the customer and so
00:30:24.200 this is what ends up happening the first
00:30:25.559 time sales seeson onboarding they're
00:30:27.600 like oh dude this is awesome this is so
00:30:29.760 good oh I'm going to use this in my
00:30:31.559 right they actually get way more data
00:30:33.480 that arms them to be more knowledgeable
00:30:35.399 in the sale and increases their
00:30:37.279 conviction as a closer for the business
00:30:40.000 because they believe in it and CS is can
00:30:43.519 look at the sales and be like hey now I
00:30:46.200 understand why they're coming in with
00:30:47.039 these expectations and they can give
00:30:48.760 sales the feedback of like hey do you
00:30:50.279 think if you sit it like this it would
00:30:51.399 change the sale a lot of guys like oh no
00:30:52.880 I don't know I just said it that way I
00:30:54.600 didn't know that they were coming in
00:30:55.639 that way and so what happens is you
00:30:56.919 create this really seamless process
00:30:59.039 between sales and Cs and you stop having
00:31:01.200 those drop offs and cold feet where
00:31:03.200 you're losing 5% of your sales or 10% of
00:31:05.360 your sales for people who close and then
00:31:06.760 back out and so that in a very real way
00:31:09.039 will increase your sales by decreasing a
00:31:11.000 negative I learned this from my software
00:31:13.159 days so when I started with Allen which
00:31:14.519 is the first software company I ever
00:31:15.639 owned um I learned from the software
00:31:17.880 world that they started doing these CS
00:31:19.519 to sales gam tape reviews and so we said
00:31:22.600 okay well if all these really big
00:31:23.799 companies that make more money than us
00:31:25.080 do this we'll give it a shot and as soon
00:31:27.120 as we did it and that first call
00:31:28.799 happened where we had the whole sales
00:31:30.120 team and the whole customer success team
00:31:31.960 on I was like oh I get it now like
00:31:34.279 everyone got a holistic view of the
00:31:35.960 customer Journey sales expectations were
00:31:38.320 better and cleaner uh they were more
00:31:40.519 knowledgeable about what the customer
00:31:41.600 Journey was going to be uh CS stopped
00:31:43.480 getting upset at sales for making
00:31:44.960 promises and it also helped because then
00:31:47.600 the Cs side was like Hey would it help
00:31:50.399 you if we did this one extra thing and
00:31:52.320 the sales guys are like dude everyone
00:31:54.000 asked for that they're like oh wouldn't
00:31:55.159 even be that hard for us to do and then
00:31:57.080 boom both sides get better they're
00:31:58.760 setting better expectations and they're
00:32:00.080 giving customers what they want more and
00:32:01.679 the Cs team didn't know because the
00:32:03.360 sales team said they couldn't do it
00:32:04.840 because they weren't communicating now
00:32:06.880 on recording sales which of course you
00:32:08.760 should do and you promise you'll do no
00:32:10.240 matter what after this video is done for
00:32:13.039 sure that's Pinky Promise that's what
00:32:14.760 you're going to start doing all right
00:32:16.360 now the next thing is what sales should
00:32:19.320 I watch all right and so this is my big
00:32:21.559 tip is there is no mysticism in sales
00:32:25.360 there's a lot of like you know it's kind
00:32:26.720 of like baseball they're like these are
00:32:27.679 my lucky socks or like I always touch
00:32:29.320 the phone here and here because uh I
00:32:31.200 close when I do that thing right there's
00:32:32.519 a lot of superstition that starts to
00:32:34.279 happen in sales because there's such fat
00:32:36.519 feed fast feedback loops so people learn
00:32:38.639 because they change their behavior uh
00:32:40.399 because it worked before and so they try
00:32:41.799 and do it again but they end up adding
00:32:43.000 all these rituals to their sales
00:32:44.799 processes that end up longterm actually
00:32:47.200 eroding uh their ability to sell all
00:32:49.279 right so they start adding all these
00:32:50.159 appendages to their sales process and
00:32:51.519 actually gets really cluttered and it
00:32:52.720 starts sucking all right now the biggest
00:32:55.000 hack that I can give you as an
00:32:56.200 individual salesperson is is that there
00:32:58.519 are times when you're hot all right
00:33:00.679 where you're like dude I feel like I
00:33:01.799 could close everyone today right you you
00:33:03.919 know it you're on fire when you're hot
00:33:07.120 record the living hell out of that and
00:33:09.760 rewatch those game tapes because you
00:33:14.519 aren't on fire you're doing things
00:33:17.279 slightly differently it means that your
00:33:19.320 Tone's a little different how you open's
00:33:21.039 a little bit different how you
00:33:22.279 transition to the Clos is a little bit
00:33:23.840 different and all you want to do is you
00:33:25.679 want to look for the details because the
00:33:27.960 big difference between good closes and
00:33:29.480 great closers is that good closers try
00:33:33.559 and get hot great closers never get cold
00:33:38.440 and it's because they've systematized
00:33:40.159 every single thing on their monster
00:33:41.519 checklist that creates the hotness of
00:33:45.399 their closing and so if you ever do get
00:33:47.760 hot know that you now have the potential
00:33:49.559 to close at that closing rate and then
00:33:51.399 say cool I'm going to analyze the living
00:33:53.679 hell out of what it looks like when I'm
00:33:55.760 hot how I say it where I pause where my
00:33:58.360 tone shifts where I ask my questions how
00:34:01.080 like when I transition to the sale how I
00:34:03.880 frame my overcomes how I'm punching back
00:34:06.039 and pushing back earlier in the sale to
00:34:07.919 overcome objections earlier before I
00:34:09.839 asked for money that is probably one of
00:34:11.800 the biggest RI tactics I can give you
00:34:13.879 either as a sales manager for your teams
00:34:15.719 or you as a sales professional just
00:34:18.359 record everything and when you're hot
00:34:20.639 analyze the living hell out of it next
00:34:22.480 one is also big team management stuff
00:34:24.599 which if you're ever in a slump so this
00:34:26.719 is for sales managers
00:34:28.320 specifically or entrepreneurs is that if
00:34:31.040 you're in a slump one of the easiest
00:34:32.679 things to do is start drilling
00:34:33.918 everything and sure you can do all that
00:34:35.800 stuff but in my experience reading
00:34:38.960 testimonials can be one of the biggest
00:34:41.760 things that you can do to increase the
00:34:44.040 conviction of the team and so you can
00:34:46.679 get someone's tone to be correct by lots
00:34:49.239 of drilling and lots of training but if
00:34:51.440 they are convicted they will always have
00:34:53.560 the correct tonality because they
00:34:55.040 genuinely believe in the product and
00:34:56.639 they genuinely believe it will help the
00:34:58.160 customer and so I like to train
00:35:00.599 competence in tone emphasis pacing I
00:35:03.960 like someone to understand all of those
00:35:05.480 things so they know what it looks like
00:35:06.520 when it's right but there's nothing that
00:35:08.599 replaces A salesperson who's actually
00:35:10.599 convicted because either you have a team
00:35:12.359 of sociopaths who don't care at all but
00:35:14.240 know how to say everything the exact
00:35:15.800 right way or you just have a team of
00:35:17.680 people who really believe in the product
00:35:19.839 and by believing the product they say
00:35:21.800 things the right way and I will tell you
00:35:23.480 personally it's way easier to find these
00:35:25.160 people than these people and so read
00:35:28.119 testimonials and then give
00:35:31.440 kudos to the
00:35:34.240 salesperson who Clos the prospect who
00:35:36.560 got the great result and so imagine this
00:35:38.560 you closed Sandy you know four weeks ago
00:35:40.720 and you had to arm wrestler into closing
00:35:42.200 she was super you know worried or
00:35:43.760 concerned but you overcame that and then
00:35:46.280 four weeks later you read a testimonial
00:35:48.520 from your manager who's like hey here's
00:35:50.680 Sandy saying like I'm so grateful that I
00:35:52.400 signed up for this thing it's completely
00:35:53.960 changed my life it's changed my business
00:35:55.560 I've lost weight whatever it is and and
00:35:58.640 you then as the salesman say Tom I know
00:36:00.839 I saw this call and I saw you arm
00:36:02.480 wrestle Sandy to get to get this deal
00:36:05.119 like awesome job because if you hadn't
00:36:06.680 done that if you hadn't stayed in the
00:36:08.119 pocket she wouldn't have this outcome
00:36:10.480 and so I learned this because I figured
00:36:13.880 out that my sales team had the highest
00:36:17.400 absurd closing percentage like 100% like
00:36:19.560 absurd closing percentages on one
00:36:22.400 specific day of the month when I had my
00:36:24.160 gyms and I was like what is it about
00:36:26.040 this day do you want to know what day it
00:36:28.000 was it was we out day and so when we'd
00:36:30.560 run our challenges every week we would
00:36:32.480 have people who'd be weighing out from
00:36:33.880 six weeks earlier and so on Friday or
00:36:36.319 Saturday we'd have way outs and so it'd
00:36:38.119 be people coming in for 15-minute
00:36:40.280 appointments and weighing out taking
00:36:42.000 their after pictures weighing out taking
00:36:43.280 their after pictures and after someone
00:36:44.920 saw 20 people lose 20 pounds 30 pounds
00:36:47.960 whatever it was in that time period when
00:36:49.720 someone would come in between those
00:36:51.240 weigh-ins or after those weigh-ins and
00:36:53.280 they're like I'm thinking about signing
00:36:54.440 up they had absolute conviction in the
00:36:57.720 fact that it was going to help them
00:36:58.800 because they had just recently that day
00:37:01.880 hours or minutes before seen 5 10 20
00:37:04.599 people literally demonstrate results in
00:37:06.400 front of them and so that conviction
00:37:08.000 they passed the Prospect and so I just
00:37:10.040 like to remind you of this if you are a
00:37:11.440 salesperson is that sales is passing
00:37:14.240 conviction from one person to another
00:37:15.960 it's an education process over a bridge
00:37:17.920 of trust and so fundamentally if a
00:37:20.160 prospect knew everything that you know
00:37:21.760 about the product they should buy now if
00:37:24.920 they knew everything that you know and
00:37:26.400 then they wouldn't Buy and you get them
00:37:28.079 to buy it means that you deceive them
00:37:29.640 which means that you are an unethical
00:37:31.000 salesperson so don't do that and so the
00:37:33.160 idea is that you want to just basically
00:37:34.480 fill in the fewest gaps you need to in
00:37:36.119 order to get them over the bridge they
00:37:37.480 say yes I know enough to make this
00:37:38.800 decision and now I want to buy now that
00:37:40.319 we've covered sales training let's talk
00:37:42.200 about what happens before the sale which
00:37:44.160 yes is absolutely part of the sale so
00:37:46.680 the first thing that a lot of people
00:37:47.800 Miss up is that the sale Begins the
00:37:49.880 moment the customer engages with your
00:37:51.319 business not the moment they get on the
00:37:52.800 phone and so how the interaction and
00:37:56.400 communication happens between click and
00:38:00.240 call Will massively change your close
00:38:03.240 rates on the team independent of what
00:38:04.839 you say so for example if you're a local
00:38:07.520 business and when you call to book the
00:38:09.880 lead you say hey uh before you get going
00:38:12.880 did you hear about us on uh you know
00:38:15.200 local City's best boot camp list or that
00:38:17.280 we won this thing three years in a row
00:38:19.079 is that how you heard about us now if
00:38:21.839 they're like no I heard about you from a
00:38:23.319 Facebook ad you still asking that
00:38:25.680 question will influence what the
00:38:28.200 customer uh perceives about your
00:38:30.560 business and then we'll be like oh wow I
00:38:32.280 I didn't know that they won that stuff
00:38:33.599 and so the questions you ask can still
00:38:35.480 be educational and frame how you exist
00:38:38.200 in the marketplace to a prospect before
00:38:39.720 you even beun selling them because you
00:38:41.319 have begun selling them and so the thing
00:38:43.599 is is that the sale
00:38:47.440 starts
00:38:49.760 at the click all right so the setting
00:38:54.599 script the ad they see
00:38:58.640 all
00:38:59.680 influence whether they're going to buy
00:39:02.599 and so this is where having continuity
00:39:04.560 and having a seamless experience between
00:39:06.960 this whole thing is what will overall
00:39:10.160 increase your closing percentage as a
00:39:12.599 team again prior to even talking to them
00:39:15.240 for the main sale so the next thing is
00:39:17.960 like okay what else can I do before the
00:39:20.040 sale that increases the likelihood that
00:39:21.880 someone closes and so the big obvious
00:39:24.680 one and ke de talks about this in his
00:39:26.640 influence book is edifying the closer so
00:39:31.119 if I am setting a call and I've already
00:39:32.839 edified the business by saying something
00:39:34.560 like hey we were on you know so and so's
00:39:36.599 list now a lot of people want to get on
00:39:38.079 those lists because they think the list
00:39:39.200 is going to somehow get them business no
00:39:40.680 the list isn't going to get you business
00:39:42.280 but telling people that you were on the
00:39:44.040 list will get you business and so that's
00:39:45.800 where and let's be real you usually just
00:39:47.119 pay five grand to the magazine so that
00:39:48.839 they put you on the list of best boot
00:39:50.640 camps in local area or best accounting
00:39:53.119 firm in local area or state whatever
00:39:56.200 then that edified the business now when
00:39:58.160 I'm qualifying the prospect I say oh I'm
00:40:00.359 going to put you on with Shawn Shawn's
00:40:02.400 unbelievable he help 400 people just
00:40:05.040 like you get to thing that you just said
00:40:08.119 you wanted in your specific
00:40:10.400 circumstances recently for example he
00:40:13.440 helped someone just like you achieve
00:40:15.079 this and this someone else like you
00:40:16.680 achieve this and this and so you're
00:40:18.000 going to love talking to him he's a
00:40:19.680 great guy and he's going to help you out
00:40:21.119 oh you know what I think he has an
00:40:22.839 opening this afternoon let me see if I
00:40:25.280 can get you in hold on two seconds
00:40:28.119 making noise in the background yep he
00:40:31.160 confirmed we're good to go four o00
00:40:33.000 Works awesome and so if you have that
00:40:36.000 versus yeah uh I got you down for four
00:40:38.720 one of our team will be reaching out
00:40:40.520 imagine the difference in terms of how
00:40:42.760 that Prospect has been pre-framed to
00:40:45.440 talk to that closer now the closer when
00:40:47.240 they start the call have to maintain
00:40:49.000 that frame that the set are set but
00:40:51.520 again this is all creating one seamless
00:40:53.400 experience of we are on top of it we are
00:40:55.560 a legitimate business and we are someone
00:40:57.359 you want to do business with the next
00:40:59.240 thing is the qualification process so a
00:41:01.560 lot of people have said a lot of things
00:41:03.760 about qualification but the nice thing
00:41:06.040 is that IBM did this massive study and
00:41:08.760 then came up with bant and bant is an
00:41:11.079 acronym that stands for
00:41:14.119 Budget
00:41:16.480 Authority
00:41:18.720 need
00:41:21.480 timing and so they said that for a lead
00:41:24.200 to be qualified for an account rep or
00:41:26.920 close closer the setter had to make sure
00:41:30.400 that they had ban they had to make sure
00:41:32.480 that the person had the budget they had
00:41:34.800 the authority to make the decision they
00:41:36.599 had the need they had the problem to
00:41:38.200 solve and they had the timing meaning
00:41:41.079 they wanted to get started soon and so
00:41:43.599 those fundamentally are the things that
00:41:44.960 are required to close a sale and so you
00:41:47.160 can do this on the call you can also do
00:41:49.440 this on the application that you have
00:41:51.280 prior to the call and even if you did
00:41:53.839 that on both you'll still probably have
00:41:55.960 to say yet again on the closing call but
00:41:58.760 you want to say it before you ask for
00:42:00.560 money and so fundamentally you're making
00:42:02.560 sure the problem the person has the
00:42:03.680 problem to solve the money to spend the
00:42:05.640 time to do the implementation and the
00:42:07.480 authority to make the decision and
00:42:09.200 people will say yes to it and then
00:42:10.480 change their mind when you ask for money
00:42:12.079 but we'll get to that later now this
00:42:13.760 section isn't about outbound per se but
00:42:16.440 I couldn't help but give you one of my
00:42:18.040 favorite outbound scripts I've ever
00:42:19.680 heard which is hey business I'm calling
00:42:24.240 about competitor period give me a call
00:42:27.960 back so think about this imagine you
00:42:30.920 have a dry cleaning business and it's
00:42:32.240 Tom's dry cleaners that's you and you've
00:42:34.200 got Jones uh because you're keeping up
00:42:36.440 with the Joneses Jones dry cleaning
00:42:38.240 across the street and you get a call
00:42:40.240 being like hey um this is Alex I'm
00:42:43.720 calling in regards to Janes dry cleaning
00:42:46.319 uh give me a call back when it's
00:42:47.480 convenient you're like so incredibly
00:42:50.880 curious that somebody has left a message
00:42:53.319 and they want to talk about your
00:42:54.440 competition and so imagine that versus
00:42:57.440 hey I'm calling from 123 Financial
00:42:59.119 wanted to see if you wanted to work like
00:43:00.480 no one gives a right but because
00:43:03.200 you have this personalized uh message
00:43:05.960 that you're sending which works via
00:43:07.160 email it also works via uh voicemail uh
00:43:09.920 the likelihood that the respond is way
00:43:11.800 way higher now when the person comes on
00:43:13.240 and they're like hey what about whatever
00:43:14.920 it's like oh it looks like they're
00:43:16.119 kicking your ass and so or hey I see
00:43:19.200 that they're in the same industry as you
00:43:20.920 and we've reached out to them as well
00:43:22.440 and then so like it's it's a very easy
00:43:24.359 Bridge into whatever you want to say
00:43:25.599 when you get into your when you actually
00:43:26.680 get into the conversation but the
00:43:28.200 response rates from
00:43:31.240 hey
00:43:32.800 x uh
00:43:36.079 calling regarding
00:43:42.440 competitor slays and while we're on the
00:43:45.720 topic of how to work leads let me give
00:43:48.559 you my favorite scripting for calling up
00:43:52.319 leads for local business when someone
00:43:54.440 opts in and so the way that I do this so
00:43:57.400 this is local
00:44:05.359 leads so when I call a lead or called a
00:44:08.119 lead and I called many of them uh I
00:44:10.280 wouldn't say hey John this is Alex I
00:44:13.880 want to see when you want to come in for
00:44:15.599 like no that's not going to work all
00:44:17.079 right so even though they already showed
00:44:18.559 interest they usually don't even know
00:44:20.079 who you are when you're calling all
00:44:21.720 right so the way I would do it is this
00:44:23.800 so I would call and I would say John not
00:44:28.040 is this John I would say John question
00:44:31.160 no my tone goes up pause and then he's
00:44:35.200 John is gonna be like yeah uh who's this
00:44:38.440 like this is Alex pause he's thinking
00:44:42.680 who is Alex who like how like and I'm
00:44:45.280 acting with the way that I'm I'm toning
00:44:47.520 toning uh that he should know who I am
00:44:51.240 all right that's the tone that I'm that
00:44:52.400 I'm bringing this it's Alex
00:44:55.839 pause and during the pause I can hear
00:44:58.440 them it's like I'm calling you because
00:45:00.599 you opted in on Facebook for our
00:45:05.079 promotion and so I just wanted to make
00:45:07.559 sure that one you weren't a crazy person
00:45:09.400 on the internet ha and if there was a
00:45:11.920 time that worked well for you to come in
00:45:13.359 and obviously to make sure that you knew
00:45:14.680 that we weren't crazy people either
00:45:16.200 right and so just in that little opener
00:45:18.960 we have we pull them in we pull them in
00:45:21.119 again then we quickly like you steamroll
00:45:23.680 this you go as fast as you can and say
00:45:25.000 Hey you opted in for that thing on
00:45:26.440 Facebook this specific promotion it's
00:45:28.119 like I'm giving them three different
00:45:29.480 kind of mental cues around what they
00:45:32.599 opted in for because people don't
00:45:33.680 remember the things they opt in for and
00:45:35.720 especially if you don't call your leads
00:45:37.240 within one minute then you call them two
00:45:39.400 days later they're in a different
00:45:40.920 Universe at this point they have no idea
00:45:42.880 what they opted in for and they might
00:45:44.040 have opted in for 10 things so they have
00:45:45.520 no clue what you're talking about and so
00:45:47.960 then you can then bring them in and
00:45:49.839 schedule time I wanted to figure out a
00:45:51.040 time that would work well for you to
00:45:52.040 come in I've got 2:00 and 4:00 today
00:45:54.359 which works better all right and so by
00:45:57.040 doing that I'm also giving two options
00:45:58.720 and saying which do you prefer rather
00:46:00.440 than saying asking them to pick a time I
00:46:02.480 look at my schedule I see my openings I
00:46:04.319 present two openings that both work for
00:46:06.079 me and then they pick and if you want to
00:46:09.119 hear a little little little little early
00:46:11.079 Alex story um when I started my gym I
00:46:13.760 used to pretend that I there were
00:46:15.280 multiple employees that worked at my gym
00:46:17.240 and I would be like this is John and
00:46:18.680 then when they come in be like oh you're
00:46:19.839 G to love Alex Alex is the amazing he's
00:46:21.440 totally going to help you out he's
00:46:22.599 helped out so many people just like you
00:46:24.000 at same same edification script they
00:46:25.960 come in and they'd be like you sound a
00:46:28.079 lot like John be like we get it all the
00:46:29.400 time and we go into it um but
00:46:33.200 alternatively uh you cannot do that if
00:46:35.400 you don't want to I was young and uh I
00:46:37.119 thought it was fun and uh to me and you
00:46:39.760 know what I was deceiving people and so
00:46:41.920 that is wrong uh but to me that's a
00:46:44.280 little bit of a white FIB of a
00:46:45.520 23-year-old gym owner trying to trying
00:46:47.640 to make it happen and the last one and
00:46:49.400 this one is so unsexy and because it's
00:46:51.720 so unsexy no one does it which is why
00:46:53.480 you make so much money doing this which
00:46:56.480 is you prep for five minutes before the
00:47:00.520 call looking up stuff about the person
00:47:03.000 or the business and so if you're a
00:47:05.839 Setter you can do this for the closer or
00:47:08.000 closer you can do this for yourself
00:47:10.440 prior to the call but you would be
00:47:12.160 amazed at how much of a genius you look
00:47:14.319 like with five minutes of prep people
00:47:16.000 are like wow this guy really did his
00:47:17.280 homework and it's not because you really
00:47:18.800 did that much homework it's just because
00:47:20.400 everyone else is so lazy that any level
00:47:22.920 of effort looks amazing all right and so
00:47:25.720 the five minutes of prep in addition to
00:47:28.040 and this is clear all the notes that the
00:47:30.480 setter sets should be in the CRM so that
00:47:34.040 when you go up with the prospect you
00:47:36.599 want to say Hey so uh you know Jimmy
00:47:38.440 earlier was telling me that you're X Y
00:47:39.720 and Z and that you've done this and
00:47:41.200 you've done this got it so it's this is
00:47:43.280 it fair to say that this is where you're
00:47:44.280 currently at right now this what you're
00:47:45.240 trying to achieve great well this sounds
00:47:46.839 like this would be a good call for you
00:47:47.800 and I think we're we're going to we're
00:47:48.800 going to figure something out together
00:47:49.880 whatever right and so the thing is is
00:47:52.000 that you never want a customer to repeat
00:47:54.200 themselves right that's not a good
00:47:56.520 experience experience overall and the
00:47:58.280 flip side is it's kind of like binary
00:47:59.960 like repeating is really negative but
00:48:01.960 you repeating to them what they told you
00:48:04.960 is exceptionally positive and so it's
00:48:07.040 this really binary swing in terms of
00:48:09.000 like this can hurt the sale this will
00:48:10.760 help the sale and so it takes five
00:48:12.800 minutes and most of the time you should
00:48:14.480 be taking notes on your sales calls
00:48:16.160 anyway so that you can look like you're
00:48:17.760 actively listening which you should be
00:48:19.960 and that way guess what happens to those
00:48:21.640 notes after the closer closes they get
00:48:23.440 passed on to customer success and then
00:48:25.640 they say so I you talked to Steve you
00:48:27.920 talk to Jim and these are the things
00:48:29.520 that you decided on I think we're going
00:48:31.000 to be able to help you out with insert
00:48:32.480 goal and the way that we're going to
00:48:33.800 help you insert goal is by following
00:48:35.559 step one two three so let's get started
00:48:38.040 right and so by setting this seamless
00:48:40.240 experience from click to close from
00:48:41.880 Setter to closer to to onboarding you
00:48:44.200 create an amazing process for prospects
00:48:46.880 to go through and again you can solve so
00:48:51.000 much of this and blow prospects Away by
00:48:53.599 just preparing for 5 minutes and either
00:48:55.640 you do the research or you at least read
00:48:57.440 the notes before the call the next one's
00:48:59.559 a small one but we have one in our sales
00:49:01.359 room which is uh a mini trampoline and
00:49:03.760 so I used to take 20 25 in-person sales
00:49:07.720 sales consults per day and so that could
00:49:10.319 be very tiring and on my really Hercules
00:49:12.680 days I would see 4850 people oneon-one
00:49:15.559 or one on two uh every 30 minutes right
00:49:18.799 and so I would get exhaust so one on1
00:49:21.000 102 for 12 hours is 48 um is what I
00:49:23.839 would do is I would do little mini J
00:49:26.040 trampoline jumps between sessions to
00:49:28.480 kind of keep my energy up and mostly to
00:49:30.680 keep my mood up because I would start to
00:49:32.079 get beat down when you have your 25th or
00:49:34.079 30th conversation that the exact same
00:49:36.440 conversation of the day it starts to
00:49:38.839 drain you and so what I figured out was
00:49:40.680 you cannot be in a bad mood and jumping
00:49:42.920 on a trampoline at the same time so try
00:49:44.760 it like seriously you can jump on a TR
00:49:46.559 like you can't even do it and frown it's
00:49:48.319 ridiculous but it really works and so I
00:49:51.200 did it and I highly recommend it if
00:49:52.880 you're somebody who struggles to keep
00:49:54.559 your energy up or keep your tone
00:49:56.160 positive
00:49:57.160 uh when you have like a long sales day
00:49:59.079 now that we covered what happened before
00:50:00.240 the sale now let's talk about the actual
00:50:02.160 sale as it begins opening up the sales
00:50:04.240 conversation you need to as quickly as
00:50:06.400 possible set the agenda of what's going
00:50:08.079 to happen so I actually think a lot
00:50:09.880 about proof promise plan just like we do
00:50:12.280 for YouTube videos just like we do for
00:50:13.839 short content because humans are still
00:50:15.799 humans their attention still works the
00:50:17.280 same way and just like the opener to a
00:50:20.440 piece of content can dictate how well
00:50:22.359 the entire video goes or How likely
00:50:24.119 someone is to pay attention the same
00:50:25.960 thing is true about how you open a sales
00:50:28.240 call and so think of every single thing
00:50:30.319 that I'm going to talk about for this
00:50:31.640 whole portion about as things that
00:50:34.240 increase the likelihood that someone
00:50:35.880 purchases and so fundamentally it's my
00:50:38.160 belief that the way sales work is that
00:50:40.160 we have 100 golden BBS we have a 100
00:50:42.319 tiny things that each of them increases
00:50:44.640 the likelihood that someone purchases
00:50:46.720 and so I will share this one perspective
00:50:48.319 with you on sales then we'll get into it
00:50:49.960 which is BF Skinner who's a behavioral
00:50:51.920 psychologist said this quote he said
00:50:54.400 people say you can lead a horse to water
00:50:56.720 you can't make a drink he said I
00:50:57.960 wholeheartedly disagree he said if I
00:51:00.359 dehydrated the horse bled it out and
00:51:02.680 salted its mouth and I put water right
00:51:04.880 in front of it when it's on the ground
00:51:06.440 on a hot day he said I can veritably
00:51:08.040 guarantee that it will drink and I kind
00:51:09.799 of see sales the same way which is that
00:51:11.359 if you control every single variable you
00:51:13.480 could in theory close every single
00:51:15.079 Prospect and so I like to think about it
00:51:17.599 that way as though all of these things
00:51:19.040 are under my control so I start sales
00:51:21.880 the same way that I start content which
00:51:24.680 is proof promise
00:51:27.799 plan and fundamentally I do this because
00:51:30.799 I believe that humans are humans and if
00:51:32.480 you want to gain someone's attention and
00:51:34.280 have authority and have them want to
00:51:36.040 wait until the end then if you can do it
00:51:38.119 that way when you're not there to
00:51:39.880 reinforce them or force them to stay on
00:51:41.480 the call and you still get people to
00:51:43.119 stay to the end then this absolutely
00:51:44.760 works when you're also there to
00:51:46.480 reinforce them on the call and keep them
00:51:48.160 going to the end and so I actually think
00:51:49.680 this is one of the easiest ways and
00:51:51.280 proof promise plan only takes 15 seconds
00:51:53.440 maybe 20 so you can absolutely get to
00:51:56.079 the point and so when you start on a
00:51:57.839 sales call it works more or less the
00:51:59.760 same way which is John decided to get
00:52:03.119 get going with you on this thing this
00:52:05.079 big promise that we're working on uh
00:52:07.240 we've done this with lots of other
00:52:08.760 people who are just like you and so this
00:52:11.160 is the process that we're going to do
00:52:12.280 and at the end of the call we're to see
00:52:13.480 if it makes sense to move forward if not
00:52:14.960 no sweat I'm going to still send you on
00:52:16.440 your way with stuff that could help you
00:52:17.680 with the problem overall right and so by
00:52:19.760 doing that we still set out our proof
00:52:21.240 promise plan right at the beginning and
00:52:22.920 what I have found in my opinion one
00:52:24.520 man's opinion is that you actually gain
00:52:26.559 more report I actually got on a sales
00:52:27.960 call uh yesterday with uh a banker for
00:52:31.720 one of the portfolio companies and they
00:52:33.280 were trying to bring our business over
00:52:34.920 and uh he said hey if you don't mind can
00:52:37.000 we just skip the foreplay and I was like
00:52:39.160 I I just immediately was like I love you
00:52:40.640 for saying that and he's like let's just
00:52:42.119 get right to it and then he set the
00:52:43.319 agenda and it was awesome and so I could
00:52:45.280 tell obviously he was a super you know
00:52:46.799 very very hot multi-million dollar
00:52:48.119 preyear salesperson because we have big
00:52:49.680 counts uh and so the same thing is True
00:52:51.920 For You especially if you sell B2B like
00:52:54.480 get to the point and when you set theend
00:52:56.680 that way you actually control the frame
00:52:58.319 because you told them how this call is
00:53:00.480 going to go and if you don't know how
00:53:02.280 the call is going to go you don't know
00:53:03.839 what you're doing and then it looks like
00:53:05.280 an increased likelihood that you waste
00:53:06.920 that person's time and so you having an
00:53:08.799 agenda also shows that you have done
00:53:10.240 this before that you're a professional
00:53:11.599 that you know what you're doing so the
00:53:13.240 next one is follow the script so I
00:53:16.119 actually asked my sales team uh to tell
00:53:18.520 me I said what are the things that I
00:53:20.240 shout at you guys that uh that have
00:53:22.240 helped you a lot so some of these isms
00:53:24.079 are directly from the horse's mouth via
00:53:26.079 other horses horsing it back to the
00:53:27.920 horse uh but I I say follow the I'll put
00:53:31.160 a little asteris here follow the
00:53:33.119 script now the reason I I want to
00:53:35.359 highlight this is that if your team does
00:53:38.359 not follow the script there is no point
00:53:40.359 in having a script and so script
00:53:43.160 adherence in my opinion is the first
00:53:45.079 thing that you drill I would rather have
00:53:47.200 100% of my team saying the script word
00:53:48.880 for word and Us close no one because
00:53:51.079 then I could then close change the
00:53:52.640 script and then get everyone to close
00:53:54.920 because if everyone follows the script
00:53:56.200 and doesn't close you have a script
00:53:57.839 problem if people aren't following the
00:53:59.760 script you can't change anything because
00:54:02.280 then you have to do it all onesie TWY
00:54:03.880 all over the place now to be clear a the
00:54:07.000 script is basically up to the ask after
00:54:09.720 the ask you have the loops that you're
00:54:11.440 going to do the overcomes that you're
00:54:13.040 going to drill with them and sometimes
00:54:14.520 that leads you down a different
00:54:15.440 Christmas tree but the first part of the
00:54:17.119 sale the first two-thirds of the sale
00:54:19.079 should be pretty much word for word the
00:54:21.599 same their answers will change but the
00:54:23.280 actual scripting Remains the Same so
00:54:24.920 there's different levels of following
00:54:26.720 the script the very surface of that
00:54:29.520 would be actually just saying the words
00:54:32.079 but there are a lot of other things in
00:54:33.640 communication like if I slow down what
00:54:35.760 I'm saying right now it sounds really
00:54:37.599 important and if I speed up what I'm
00:54:38.920 saying what it sounds is going to be
00:54:39.960 really like interesting and I'm very
00:54:41.359 excited about I'm transferring that to
00:54:42.559 you and you might increase the speedo as
00:54:44.960 you're approaching the close but then
00:54:46.319 when you go for the ask you might slow
00:54:47.640 down you might lower your voice again
00:54:49.520 and the thing is is that you can also
00:54:51.079 change the meaning of a sentence by
00:54:52.760 changing how you say it so I got this
00:54:54.720 from Jason F FL was a good
00:54:57.079 um and he said and I love this one I
00:54:59.400 didn't say he hit his wife which implies
00:55:01.720 that I wasn't the one who said it I
00:55:03.760 didn't say he hit his wife I didn't say
00:55:06.799 he hit his wife I didn't say he hit his
00:55:09.160 wife I didn't say he hit his wife I
00:55:11.720 didn't say he hit his wife I didn't say
00:55:13.960 it his wife each of those sentences are
00:55:16.559 all the same exact words but mean very
00:55:19.280 different things and so one is you can
00:55:22.119 change the meaning of a sentence by
00:55:23.599 where you emphasize the next is your
00:55:26.440 ality so me going low or me going high
00:55:28.720 both of those things can change what a
00:55:29.920 sentence means so if I say a statement
00:55:33.000 like you're doing 3 million a year
00:55:35.440 versus you're doing three million a year
00:55:37.760 those are two very different things one
00:55:39.280 is a question asking somebody to respond
00:55:41.119 back and the other is me just making a
00:55:43.000 statement and then moving on and so you
00:55:45.280 can increase or increase the tone of
00:55:47.480 your voice at the end of a sentence
00:55:48.839 which then implies that you're asking
00:55:50.400 for a response from the Prospect and so
00:55:53.359 one is you have emphasis which is where
00:55:55.720 am I going to
00:55:58.839 pause the second is that you have tone
00:56:01.559 which is am I going to go low am I going
00:56:03.039 to go high and how is it going to change
00:56:04.559 throughout the sentence and then finally
00:56:06.319 you have pacing where do I slow down
00:56:08.760 when I really want to make sure that you
00:56:10.520 hear every word that I'm saying because
00:56:12.799 it's very important and this is a matter
00:56:15.440 OFA tone to increase trust with the
00:56:17.799 prospect because what I'm sharing is
00:56:19.720 something that I haven't told other
00:56:21.000 people or whatever right and so pacing
00:56:23.440 can go slow and fast toning can go up
00:56:25.359 and down emphasis is where you pause and
00:56:27.760 so when you're following the script or
00:56:30.319 making the script you want the script to
00:56:32.799 have a tone guide with it and so you
00:56:34.799 could have XY z w as the words and you
00:56:38.440 can use the things on a word processor
00:56:40.520 AKA Google Docs or whatever you type
00:56:42.520 stuff on and you can say if I underline
00:56:44.839 it means slow down if I put this in all
00:56:48.160 caps then it means emphasize this if I
00:56:52.160 put this in italics then it means create
00:56:55.000 space whatever so so the nice thing is
00:56:56.960 that on word processors you have
00:56:59.000 underline italics bold and caps and so
00:57:02.960 those things give you four different
00:57:04.760 kind of cues for the closer so that when
00:57:07.359 they're reading the script they know how
00:57:09.359 they're supposed to read the script and
00:57:11.160 so when you're drilling the first thing
00:57:12.640 you're going for is actually saying the
00:57:14.319 right words once you have a team that
00:57:16.400 can breathe the script which they should
00:57:18.079 do very quickly because it's not that
00:57:19.839 many words you should only be looking at
00:57:21.839 you know 12 questions that you might be
00:57:23.920 asking maybe one follow-up or two for
00:57:26.240 the questions not something that's like
00:57:27.839 the Gettysburg address here right which
00:57:29.880 you still memorized when you were in
00:57:31.039 sixth grade anyways and so and you did
00:57:33.240 it for free rather than getting paid for
00:57:34.799 it all right here the 2011 version of
00:57:37.039 following the script is saying the words
00:57:38.880 the way they need to be said in order to
00:57:40.760 increase the likelihood that the person
00:57:42.520 buys all right so now that we have okay
00:57:44.799 you have to follow the words we
00:57:46.200 emphasize tone and pacing we can write
00:57:48.119 the script in a way that helps the
00:57:50.520 closers uh have the right tone at each
00:57:53.160 portion of the sale then we can move on
00:57:55.760 to the actual scripting itself now I
00:57:58.319 have used something called The Closer
00:57:59.960 framework for a long time I don't think
00:58:01.920 that this is magical it just is an
00:58:03.839 acronym that people remember more than
00:58:06.480 anything um and if people remember it
00:58:08.680 then it means it's been effective at
00:58:10.200 teaching them because if they remember
00:58:11.720 it then it changes their behavior they
00:58:13.000 have learned and so there are probably
00:58:14.799 more complex ways we have a different
00:58:16.480 scripting process that I call the
00:58:17.760 diagnostic script I've made a big video
00:58:19.280 about that but for the vast majority of
00:58:21.079 sales calls that are specifically
00:58:22.720 transactional so it's one call two call
00:58:24.520 closes I usually follow this structure
00:58:27.559 and so the C stands for clarify why they
00:58:30.760 are here all right and so if you get on
00:58:33.079 the phone and someone says I just want
00:58:35.039 to have more information people don't
00:58:36.760 get on the phone to get more information
00:58:38.319 no one wants to learn stuff people get
00:58:40.200 on the phone because they want to solve
00:58:41.160 a problem and so we need to get really
00:58:43.079 clear we clarify the problem that
00:58:45.599 they're like why are you here this is
00:58:47.680 that the question that we're answering
00:58:49.160 now it's like why'd you take the time to
00:58:50.480 hop on the call today what made you
00:58:51.720 reach out to us what made you op on the
00:58:53.119 site and what you want to ask in these
00:58:54.599 types of questions that are clarifying
00:58:55.799 the problem are reminding them of
00:58:58.160 actions they took to show up on your
00:59:00.240 call and so the thing is is even if
00:59:02.240 you're outbow no matter what every lead
00:59:04.839 that you talk to is engaged meaning
00:59:06.440 they've taken one action towards you so
00:59:08.160 hey what made you what made you comment
00:59:09.559 on my post what made you respond to my
00:59:10.960 email what made you set a call on my
00:59:12.799 calendar no matter what it is what made
00:59:14.440 you pick up the phone and and keep
00:59:15.640 listening to me like they've always done
00:59:17.880 something to uh now obviously if you're
00:59:20.359 in a close you're probably not closing
00:59:21.480 on on a cold first Outreach right um
00:59:23.720 they've done something at this point to
00:59:24.960 indicate interest and we will remind
00:59:27.160 them of the interest and then tie that
00:59:29.119 to a problem they're trying to solve all
00:59:30.599 right then we label them now I this is
00:59:33.799 like the shortest part of the script but
00:59:35.799 it's incredibly important all right
00:59:37.640 which is you label them with that
00:59:38.960 problem so you've clarified it but you
00:59:40.839 said okay so just to make sure I'm clear
00:59:44.480 you are here you want to get here and
00:59:47.760 this has been the issue that's been
00:59:48.960 holding you back what you're essentially
00:59:50.760 doing is establishing the gap between
00:59:53.000 present and desired and sometimes the
00:59:55.599 obstacle that they believe is standing
00:59:57.599 in their way once you have that you have
00:59:59.480 now set the table for making a sale
01:00:01.520 because now you have this is where you
01:00:02.720 want this is where you are this is where
01:00:04.000 you want and we've got this big dragon I
01:00:06.119 think I can give you the sword to slay
01:00:07.599 it or I can slay it for you whatever the
01:00:10.359 next part of the sale is overviewing
01:00:13.200 past pain now the reason the overview of
01:00:16.440 the pain is so important I call the pain
01:00:18.440 cycle is something that I've actually
01:00:20.440 only learned about I I learned this
01:00:23.000 while I was selling I just knew that
01:00:24.480 talking about people's pain and what
01:00:25.839 they done before got more people to buy
01:00:27.960 I didn't know why I just knew that that
01:00:29.559 ended up always being the case now later
01:00:32.440 I know a little bit more about sales uh
01:00:34.319 and more just human behavior and
01:00:37.119 deprivation creates motivation and so if
01:00:41.920 I am hungry I am motivated to eat if I'm
01:00:46.319 tired I'm deprived of sleep means I'm
01:00:48.760 motivated to sleep if I am if I haven't
01:00:51.559 seen my wife in a few days I might be
01:00:53.920 motivated to do other things you get the
01:00:56.079 idea if you're deprived You Are by
01:00:58.799 definition motivated to end the
01:01:01.160 deprivation and so what we want to do in
01:01:03.520 the sales call is basically expand the
01:01:06.480 deprivation we want to bring their state
01:01:09.799 of deprivation to top of mind so that in
01:01:13.240 the moment we can increase their
01:01:14.880 deprivation which then rubber bands back
01:01:17.000 to increasing motivation to solve it and
01:01:19.480 so if you've probably seen you know
01:01:21.000 political polls where they're like
01:01:22.520 what's the topic of this election what
01:01:24.440 they do is they specifically choose
01:01:26.280 topics to deprive the population of so
01:01:29.359 that we say this is now more important
01:01:31.039 for us it's not that education isn't
01:01:32.839 important but for apparently this
01:01:34.160 election it's not no one's talked about
01:01:36.200 education right but in different
01:01:38.160 elections they've been like this is a
01:01:39.599 big problem and so then that becomes the
01:01:41.039 thing that everyone talks about and then
01:01:42.640 that's the main reason people choose the
01:01:44.880 people that they're going to elect and
01:01:46.799 so this deprivation motivates a change
01:01:49.520 in behavior and within the context of
01:01:51.680 sales that means taking the action to
01:01:53.920 move forward in the sales process or
01:01:55.920 taking the action to buy this is why the
01:01:58.760 pain cycle is so important and so I have
01:02:02.160 a little ISM that I have in my sales
01:02:04.400 team which is the pain is the pitch like
01:02:06.880 the pain is the thing that often it's
01:02:08.880 the Gap we have to make sure that they
01:02:11.680 have it's like well I tried this thing
01:02:13.119 and I tried this thing and I tried this
01:02:14.440 thing and so we want to quantify how
01:02:16.119 much they've spent so far in time and
01:02:17.839 effort and what the impact that's been
01:02:20.440 on their status within their community
01:02:22.680 and how much it's costing them to not do
01:02:25.640 this every day so this is the cost of
01:02:27.640 inaction or the cost of failure every
01:02:30.000 single day that they don't achieve this
01:02:31.480 thing whatever it is that they want and
01:02:33.200 the reason we highlight those pains is
01:02:34.839 because it creates urgency it creates an
01:02:37.559 increased likelihood that they act so
01:02:39.839 the pain cycle that I ran with like
01:02:41.160 weight loss for examples what have you
01:02:42.599 done so far to try and lose weight and
01:02:44.359 then when someone would say I did Weight
01:02:46.359 Watchers or I did you know whatever it
01:02:49.319 didn't matter I knew what my pitch was
01:02:51.760 going to be because I had a three
01:02:53.279 three-pillar pitch which we'll get to in
01:02:54.640 the S we which I would always try and
01:02:57.520 highlight the good things of the things
01:02:59.240 they did and the things that it was
01:03:00.520 missing when they brought it up and so
01:03:02.160 if someone said hey I did you know
01:03:03.559 Weight Watchers I would say great so
01:03:05.520 they gave you nutrition I was like but
01:03:07.119 I'm guessing you kind of bounc back now
01:03:08.920 remember everything they've done is an
01:03:11.039 advantage for you because they are here
01:03:12.960 in the sale which means it did not solve
01:03:14.599 the problem and so I remember even
01:03:15.960 having somebody came in who's like I
01:03:17.079 already have a personal trainer and I'm
01:03:18.480 like yeah he's obviously not doing a
01:03:19.640 good job but she just looked at me
01:03:20.760 sideways I was like you're here and so
01:03:23.279 she was like fair right and so then I
01:03:24.880 closed the sale but the thing is is that
01:03:26.599 so you know Weight Watchers was they had
01:03:28.359 nutrition and they had accountability
01:03:29.799 but they didn't have Fitness right and
01:03:31.559 so you lost the weight then you gained
01:03:32.760 it back because you lost muscle when you
01:03:33.960 did it oh that's why it didn't work six
01:03:35.920 from gold all we have to do is fix this
01:03:37.440 one thing and then we can get you
01:03:38.520 success uh oh I did the gyms before but
01:03:40.760 it didn't work for me well did they give
01:03:42.000 you a personalized food plant well you
01:03:43.440 know what they did okay did they hold
01:03:44.839 you accountable to doing it no they
01:03:46.279 didn't okay so you had Fitness and
01:03:47.599 Nutrition you didn't have accountability
01:03:49.079 because if you have Fitness Nutrition
01:03:50.279 and accountability you can't fail
01:03:51.440 fundamentally if you eat the food you
01:03:53.000 work the work the working out and this
01:03:54.520 actually makes sure you do the first two
01:03:55.799 you're going to lose the weight right
01:03:57.720 and so every business has I call a
01:04:00.480 three-pillar pitch that's buried inside
01:04:02.079 of it so I was making I always tell the
01:04:03.520 story because it's a fun one but I was
01:04:05.359 making a sales script for a marketing
01:04:07.240 company that was selling leads to
01:04:08.160 mortgage brokers and Realtors I spent
01:04:09.839 the whole morning being like what are
01:04:10.960 the three things like what are the three
01:04:12.520 things that makes an amazing lead and so
01:04:14.599 it's like okay well you want and I came
01:04:15.880 up with you want leads to be timely you
01:04:18.119 want leads to be uh qualified and you
01:04:20.359 want them to be exclusive right and so
01:04:22.720 basically it's like it's basically going
01:04:24.799 through b it's like you want them to
01:04:26.720 have the budget you want them to have
01:04:28.640 the timing and you want them to have uh
01:04:31.680 the authority and or need right and so
01:04:33.760 obviously the need was established
01:04:34.920 because they were leads in already
01:04:35.760 indicated interest right and so was
01:04:37.319 really just controlling for the other
01:04:38.640 three in the three-pillar pitch and so
01:04:41.480 when we were talking and so when we
01:04:42.760 scripted it out it's like oh have you
01:04:44.039 ever done have you ever bought leads in
01:04:45.279 the past and if they had and obviously
01:04:47.839 they weren't having a good experience
01:04:48.960 because they were on the phone with us
01:04:49.920 be like oh what was it and all we had to
01:04:52.119 do was pick out oh you you were getting
01:04:55.039 leads from Zillow but they weren't
01:04:57.200 exclusive to you right and so you had to
01:04:59.279 compete with 20 other guys so you had
01:05:01.839 good quality leads they had the budget
01:05:03.240 and they had the interest and presumably
01:05:05.319 the authority to make a decision right
01:05:07.079 but but they weren't exclusive to you
01:05:08.920 and so that was the problem and if You'
01:05:10.119 had leads that were exclusive do you
01:05:11.520 think you'd be able to make money
01:05:12.359 they're like oh my God if I had an
01:05:13.279 exclusive it would been great you're
01:05:14.119 like awesome boom established the Gap
01:05:15.799 figured out the poll in between boom we
01:05:17.480 can pull him over we can help you out
01:05:19.119 right and so every pitch usually now to
01:05:22.760 be very clear I'm not saying that it's
01:05:25.440 always three things that triangulate a
01:05:28.960 sale I'm saying that humans tend to
01:05:31.400 think in threes and so when I make a
01:05:33.440 sales pitch I try and chunk up to the
01:05:36.000 three big things so you might be like
01:05:37.119 well we have a seven-step process it's
01:05:38.440 like fine Chunk Up Until It's three so
01:05:41.400 nutrition I could break down into like
01:05:43.400 okay well we've got calories we've got
01:05:44.960 macronutrients we got micronutrients
01:05:46.520 we've got meal timing we've got meal
01:05:48.119 composition like I could get it I could
01:05:50.119 get as fancy as we wanted to to create
01:05:52.039 more components but you just want to
01:05:53.480 chunk up to three because people tend to
01:05:55.680 remember it now when you get to the S
01:05:59.400 which is the sell the vacation which
01:06:01.680 I've already kind of gotten
01:06:04.279 into we want to talk about the vacation
01:06:07.760 we want to talk about Maui we don't want
01:06:09.880 to talk about the plane flight we don't
01:06:11.279 want to talk about TSA we don't to talk
01:06:13.160 about taking shoes off going through
01:06:14.400 security you know getting padded down uh
01:06:17.279 how how bumpy and you know it's going to
01:06:18.839 be on the on the plane the food you're
01:06:20.160 going to have to eat the person sitting
01:06:21.279 next to you is going to smell bad like
01:06:22.680 we don't want to talk about any of that
01:06:24.039 we want to talk about Maui we want to
01:06:25.359 talk about the experience of what it
01:06:27.200 will be like when they've accomplished
01:06:29.119 the thing the the transformation that
01:06:31.319 we're selling whatever it is now when we
01:06:34.799 have the three-pillar pitch I like to
01:06:37.440 make the statement of what you need like
01:06:39.720 exclusive right or it needs to be
01:06:41.920 nutrition you need to have whatever the
01:06:43.400 pillar is you make the statement and
01:06:45.400 then you give the metaphor all right and
01:06:47.520 so this is how I do my three-pillar
01:06:49.160 pitches and normally a three-pillar
01:06:51.000 pitch shouldn't be longer than 2 minutes
01:06:54.520 and so if you're like wait a second
01:06:56.039 so this whole sale I'm only going to be
01:06:58.079 talking about my product for like two
01:06:59.400 minutes yep because you want to be
01:07:01.240 talking about the prospect not the
01:07:03.279 product and so if I want to get into a
01:07:05.359 new organization and I want to figure
01:07:06.599 out how to sell I'm going to spend 90%
01:07:08.440 of my time trying to understand the
01:07:09.799 pains remember for motivation the Pains
01:07:12.520 of the Prospect and once you know the
01:07:14.559 Pains of a prospect and this is me just
01:07:16.480 you know taking my ethical disclaimer
01:07:17.960 hat on you can sell them
01:07:20.160 anything because fundamentally if you
01:07:22.480 know where someone is and you know where
01:07:24.119 they want to go and you know the things
01:07:25.520 things they've struggled with if I
01:07:27.319 wanted to sell supplements you just sell
01:07:28.920 that as the bridge between where they're
01:07:30.799 at and where they want to go or you sell
01:07:32.599 nutrition coaching or you sell Fitness
01:07:34.640 or you sell all three it doesn't really
01:07:36.359 matter you could sell your piece of
01:07:37.920 equipment either way you're going to
01:07:39.799 have where they're at where they want to
01:07:41.200 go difficulties they've had and then you
01:07:42.799 just Bridge it with the product but most
01:07:45.200 sales teams spend all their time trying
01:07:47.319 to train people on the product and not
01:07:48.799 the Prospect and so then they sound
01:07:50.799 really ill-informed and ask stupid
01:07:52.760 questions that anybody who knew more
01:07:54.160 about the prospect would already know
01:07:55.880 the answer to it so I'll give you three
01:07:58.480 of my my favorite kind of metaphors um
01:08:00.799 that I used to use around uh
01:08:02.480 accountability uh and so I had the
01:08:04.119 three-pillar pitch one is I would just
01:08:05.799 the fact that I would call it the
01:08:06.720 three-pillar pitch I call the three legs
01:08:08.000 the stool and so I was like you can have
01:08:10.319 if you have two then the stool Falls
01:08:12.079 over right you can maybe balance it for
01:08:13.640 a little bit maybe you did do nutrition
01:08:15.480 and accountability for a little bit with
01:08:16.640 Weight Watchers you lost 50 but you G
01:08:18.080 back 60 and they like yeah like right so
01:08:19.880 you had it it balanced but then it fell
01:08:21.520 over right but if you have all three and
01:08:23.520 I could use my hands and I would show
01:08:24.759 them that then they'd be like oh I get
01:08:26.520 it it's like yeah this is what you need
01:08:28.238 in order to be successful this so I make
01:08:30.279 an analogy or metaphor of what the three
01:08:33.238 pillars that we have and how it relates
01:08:34.839 to something that's a strong structure
01:08:36.399 now does the Dynamics of how a stool
01:08:39.479 stands have anything to do with SEO or
01:08:42.880 how we get leads from mortgage brokers
01:08:45.399 no but it helps people understand and so
01:08:49.600 fundamentally what a metaphor is is it
01:08:51.279 Compares something they don't understand
01:08:53.399 your thing that you sell with something
01:08:55.000 they do understand and you make
01:08:56.439 parallels fundamentally by the way this
01:08:58.279 is what teaching is and so if we want to
01:09:01.000 have a metaphor so I use I use these two
01:09:02.920 for accountability which absolutely slay
01:09:04.759 one I got from Alison Prince the other
01:09:06.120 one I got from Tom Miller so I'll give
01:09:08.679 you the toothbrush one so you say hey uh
01:09:12.238 when you were a kid did you hate
01:09:13.560 brushing your teeth right all of a said
01:09:15.000 or if they have kids it's like do your
01:09:16.040 kids hate brushing their teeth yeah of
01:09:17.158 course but you know and so every night
01:09:19.040 you're like hey brush your teeth they
01:09:20.238 like brush the teeth and they go to bed
01:09:22.719 and now you're an adult do you brush
01:09:24.279 your teeth now and the answer is yes
01:09:26.399 most people do if you have a weirdo then
01:09:28.399 maybe you shouldn't sell them anyways so
01:09:30.198 you brush your teeth now of course okay
01:09:32.479 so what happened was in the beginning
01:09:34.479 you had external accountability your
01:09:36.679 parent was your coach saying hey kept
01:09:38.719 reminding you kept reminding you kept
01:09:39.839 reminding you and then over time the
01:09:42.399 positive reinforcement of doing the
01:09:44.359 behavior became the internal motivation
01:09:46.158 to stick with it and so what we're doing
01:09:48.120 is we're going to artificially become
01:09:50.080 that external motivation that you need
01:09:51.439 in the beginning to create the Habit so
01:09:52.880 that you can do this long term right now
01:09:55.040 that's I would sell accountability and
01:09:57.080 so me saying that notice I'm not saying
01:09:59.960 hey we're going to reach out to you this
01:10:00.960 many days and we're going to be on this
01:10:02.320 channel of communication these are the
01:10:03.960 the response times I just say big
01:10:06.159 picture you didn't brush your teeth and
01:10:07.880 you hated it and now you brush your
01:10:09.320 teeth and you don't miss a day and the
01:10:10.920 big thing that was the difference was
01:10:12.320 this thing and that's what we're going
01:10:13.239 to provide to you done then a different
01:10:16.199 version of this was uh The Amazing Race
01:10:18.040 in The Amazing Race uh they actually had
01:10:20.560 to change the rules because there was a
01:10:22.080 couple that won too many times that they
01:10:25.120 had had to say they had to dismantle
01:10:26.640 their advantage you know what the
01:10:27.560 advantage was well what they would do is
01:10:30.159 whenever they get dropped off this new
01:10:31.400 area they would find a local person put
01:10:33.159 him in the back seat pay him for the day
01:10:34.480 and say hey help us get to this place
01:10:36.239 and because they had a local they beat
01:10:38.120 everyone else who tried to do it on
01:10:39.239 their own and so what I want to do right
01:10:41.120 now is I've been to where you're going
01:10:42.719 and I've been in the backseat with a
01:10:44.000 hundred other people just like you and I
01:10:46.040 can be your backseat driver because
01:10:47.600 it'll give you an unfair advantage that
01:10:49.000 makes sense done you've already moved on
01:10:50.719 from the pillar right and so that's how
01:10:52.840 you explain that's those are two
01:10:54.080 metaphors to explain something right and
01:10:55.960 if I sold supplements I would give
01:10:57.520 metaphors around uh you know protein or
01:11:00.560 whatever right and so the whole idea is
01:11:02.080 that you want to know what your three
01:11:03.120 pillar are and then you want to know uh
01:11:05.520 an analogy that makes it more relevant
01:11:07.360 if I was selling SEO I'd be like hey
01:11:09.440 well think about your ads as your
01:11:11.120 paycheck that you get every month you
01:11:12.159 have to put you have to put work in make
01:11:13.600 new ads put money in but you get money
01:11:15.239 out immediately think about SEO like an
01:11:17.080 investment account you're going to put
01:11:18.280 money in but it's not really going to be
01:11:19.920 much for a while but eventually it
01:11:21.400 starts compounding and then within one
01:11:23.080 year or two years it's going to be
01:11:24.480 bigger than anything you could do
01:11:25.840 actively right but it just takes time so
01:11:27.960 it's just like an investment account
01:11:29.640 right and so that's my analogy so you've
01:11:31.199 got SEO and paid traffic it's the same
01:11:32.920 as income and investment right and so
01:11:36.000 whatever the three things that you're
01:11:37.320 selling are you just want to have a
01:11:38.679 clear analogy that someone can just say
01:11:40.560 got it because if you start getting into
01:11:42.440 details you get into the weeds and
01:11:44.320 that's where you die and by the way if
01:11:46.199 you're working leads because you didn't
01:11:47.719 work them fast you didn't work them
01:11:49.120 enough and then you get ghosted at any
01:11:50.800 part in the sales cycle just send them a
01:11:53.440 meme just send them a meme like there's
01:11:55.639 the Kevin Hart meme where he's like
01:11:56.840 where you at um and it actually has the
01:12:00.120 highest response rate out of any
01:12:01.360 messages that we've sent just sending
01:12:03.199 the meme and so uh that that Meme has
01:12:05.840 made a lot of salespeople a lot of money
01:12:08.360 and so you can just send that to your
01:12:09.639 cold pipeline send it to 200 guys uh and
01:12:12.159 you'll probably get five to 10 that just
01:12:14.000 re-engage off of that and they'll
01:12:15.280 probably laugh and then you're back in
01:12:16.520 the saddle and I'll explain why closes
01:12:18.800 die in the details when we get into the
01:12:20.239 closing section all right now the last
01:12:23.120 two pieces are actually around closing
01:12:24.920 which is is if you've sold them at this
01:12:26.520 point you've said hey does that sound
01:12:27.719 good you're ready to move forward ready
01:12:28.960 to get started ready to get some traffic
01:12:30.639 to your site ready to start losing the
01:12:32.120 weight ready to start getting back to
01:12:33.320 that High School weight whatever it is
01:12:34.400 ready to ready to insert goal that's how
01:12:37.320 you know you can ask for the sale great
01:12:38.600 let me get your ID or whatever let me
01:12:39.880 get your information start moving
01:12:40.920 forward then if they don't say yes you
01:12:44.120 explain
01:12:45.360 away concerns all right this is
01:12:48.760 fundamentally closing this is objection
01:12:51.800 handling which is the perfect thing to
01:12:54.000 get into right now now that we've
01:12:56.040 covered the open now we have to get our
01:12:58.360 money we got to close before I dive into
01:13:00.440 to the tactics one I'm going to be
01:13:02.320 bringing in audience objections so we
01:13:04.280 pulled my uh YouTube audience and said
01:13:05.960 hey what are some of the objections that
01:13:06.960 you guys are struggling with so I'm
01:13:08.040 going to be uh overcoming some of those
01:13:09.800 now live and on top of that I want to
01:13:13.800 preface with the fact that you should
01:13:15.840 train sales back to front so what do I
01:13:18.280 mean by that you want to make sure that
01:13:21.320 someone knows how to collect payment and
01:13:23.560 process as the first thing that you you
01:13:25.199 teach a closer why because if they don't
01:13:27.800 know how to do that they have a 0%
01:13:29.600 chance of closing and so the next thing
01:13:32.080 that you would teach someone is how to
01:13:33.320 ask for payment and how to ask for
01:13:35.440 someone to get started because if they
01:13:36.840 don't know how to do that the likel that
01:13:38.320 they close a sale is zero and so a lot
01:13:40.719 of people start at the top of the script
01:13:42.880 when they start teaching a closer but
01:13:44.560 it's my preference to start at the
01:13:46.000 bottom of the script because that is
01:13:47.360 what's required to close that being said
01:13:49.800 where does closing begin closing begins
01:13:52.639 once someone says no and to be very
01:13:55.760 clear just be because they said no once
01:13:58.440 doesn't mean they're saying no forever
01:13:59.800 or they're going to say no over and over
01:14:01.239 again and we have to train and expect no
01:14:04.800 that is the job of sales if every person
01:14:06.480 immediately says yes honestly you're not
01:14:08.560 really required we could just record the
01:14:10.080 video put it in front and then just put
01:14:11.679 a buy button and to be fair Tesla does
01:14:14.080 this and they they do a pretty good job
01:14:15.719 of it right and so depending on how good
01:14:17.360 you are at marketing you might not need
01:14:18.480 sales at all but under the assumption
01:14:20.159 that you're not the perfect marketer and
01:14:21.800 people come in with more questions or
01:14:23.239 more concerns when they say no is when
01:14:25.400 closers Step Up So before I get into all
01:14:28.719 the things that we can go for I want to
01:14:31.800 break down the one time where you shut
01:14:33.679 up all right which is if someone says
01:14:36.639 yes and says yes I'm in shut up and
01:14:40.360 close the sale do not sell yourself out
01:14:43.400 of a sale and this is something that a
01:14:45.520 lot of beginners do they get excited
01:14:47.040 when the person says yes and then they
01:14:48.639 start bringing up more details and then
01:14:51.080 those new details increase the
01:14:53.480 likelihood greater than zero that they
01:14:55.800 take a yes and turn it back into a maybe
01:14:57.800 or take a yes and turn into a no the
01:14:59.960 moment you have agreement you shut your
01:15:01.719 mouth you ask for payment information
01:15:03.199 and you close yeah it's like you're
01:15:05.000 you're at the bar and you're like hey
01:15:06.000 you want to go back and she's like sure
01:15:07.520 and then you're like oh yeah I'll show
01:15:08.600 you my Star Wars collection she's like
01:15:11.120 actually just kidding it's like no you
01:15:12.960 wait and then you show her the Star Wars
01:15:14.600 collection because it's sick but you
01:15:16.040 don't say it until you're back right
01:15:18.639 that's the
01:15:20.040 idea save your Lego Star Wars lightsaber
01:15:23.239 for after she gets back the next one is
01:15:25.840 that if someone says anything that you
01:15:28.800 aren't prepared for it's because you are
01:15:31.520 underprepared and so
01:15:34.880 prep equals
01:15:38.560 smooth
01:15:40.080 meaning you should in one breath know
01:15:43.120 exactly what you're going to say back to
01:15:45.159 the person when they have any kind of
01:15:47.960 objection if someone says I got to think
01:15:49.800 about it or hey you know like give me a
01:15:51.239 day or two or hey I got to talk to my
01:15:52.840 spouse or um you know I don't really
01:15:54.560 like this particular thing about the
01:15:56.040 product you should already be like take
01:15:58.360 inhaling to begin the next part of your
01:16:01.080 clothes now to be fair or to be clear
01:16:03.960 you don't want to make what you're about
01:16:05.520 to say sound like an obsolute overcome
01:16:07.760 or sound like a pre-recording and so I
01:16:10.040 made a whole video about the AAA method
01:16:12.679 which is you acknowledge then you
01:16:14.920 associate and then you move on in the
01:16:16.480 sale and you ask your next question that
01:16:18.080 is what gives the appearance of a more
01:16:20.960 natural sale meanwhile the whole time
01:16:24.000 there's nothing they can say that you
01:16:25.719 should not already know the answer to
01:16:27.800 because it is your literal job to have
01:16:29.800 this one conversation 10 times a day for
01:16:32.560 your entire life and so the fact that a
01:16:34.760 prospect can say anything that surprises
01:16:36.639 you just says that you are underprepared
01:16:40.000 that being said once we are prepped we
01:16:42.320 expect and plan for no and no is not a
01:16:45.360 failure it's to be expected so what
01:16:47.800 happens as soon as someone says I'm not
01:16:50.600 sure I need to think about it whatever
01:16:52.840 so what I want to do is give you my
01:16:54.400 rapid Fire series of questions that I
01:16:56.920 ask prior to get into anything that's
01:16:59.280 real closing all right and so the
01:17:02.199 questions that I ask are in order first
01:17:05.560 off what's your main concern all right
01:17:06.960 so if I'm early on in the sale and this
01:17:08.760 is the first no I get I'm like hey
01:17:10.199 what's your main concern because they
01:17:11.560 say I need to think about it you say
01:17:12.679 cool what's your main concern and then
01:17:13.639 you're right back in the sale it's not
01:17:14.760 like oh I need to think about it the
01:17:15.880 sale's over it's what's your main
01:17:17.320 concern let's talk about it together
01:17:18.159 let's figured it out now if you're
01:17:19.800 further on in the sale then I like to
01:17:21.760 ask a little bit harder questions so
01:17:23.480 would be like hey what are you afraid of
01:17:24.560 having happen right like dude I just
01:17:26.360 need to think about it's like dude what
01:17:27.360 are you afraid of right what do you what
01:17:29.040 do you think's going to happen what
01:17:30.480 what's the big thing that you're trying
01:17:31.520 to avoid right I ask that question
01:17:33.239 because it gets to the heart of the
01:17:34.639 issue and what you hear after that is
01:17:38.120 usually the real obstacle and that you
01:17:40.639 cannot overcome rather than I need to
01:17:42.400 think about it which you can't right and
01:17:43.960 so all of the things that uh get around
01:17:46.760 stall overcomes all basically try and
01:17:49.320 tease out why they're stalling and how
01:17:51.600 to make a decision and so from there
01:17:54.440 what's the concern what are the
01:17:55.840 variables you're using to make the
01:17:57.199 decision and my my final two that I love
01:18:00.159 very close to my heart is what makes
01:18:02.639 this a
01:18:04.120 yes what makes this a yes and if they
01:18:07.400 can't answer that question then you can
01:18:08.840 say well can I share with you some of
01:18:10.520 the the decision-making variables that I
01:18:11.920 often hear when I when I ask that
01:18:13.120 question sure now what makes this and
01:18:16.480 this is a really good one if they're
01:18:18.280 like I'm just not sure then you're like
01:18:20.000 totally understand what makes it
01:18:22.840 a and so people are so afraid to ask
01:18:26.040 what it would get someone to not buy the
01:18:28.239 thing is is that you've had this
01:18:29.480 conversation more times than them and so
01:18:31.760 sometimes they're like I you know I
01:18:33.600 don't really know you're like that's
01:18:36.000 amazing acknowledge and then we
01:18:38.840 associate it's like well it sounds like
01:18:41.560 you know believe it or not you're a
01:18:43.600 totally normal person because anybody
01:18:45.600 who'd be making a decision like this
01:18:47.239 really fast would be crazy we wouldn't
01:18:49.239 want to work with them um but it also
01:18:52.679 sounds to me like this is just that
01:18:54.120 you're nerous about making the decision
01:18:55.800 which makes you just like all the people
01:18:57.159 who end up buying and getting amazing
01:18:59.199 results and so now I Associated their
01:19:02.280 what was once I need to think about it
01:19:04.960 to I don't know what makes this a no
01:19:07.320 which then you circumvent by saying oh
01:19:09.199 it just sounds like you're afraid of
01:19:10.360 making the decision which makes you just
01:19:11.800 like other people who get amazing
01:19:13.520 results because it shows that you care
01:19:16.040 if you care you're going to follow
01:19:17.360 through and you're going to do amazing
01:19:18.560 if you don't care this is going to be
01:19:20.280 awful and so it's actually better that
01:19:22.000 you had this
01:19:23.080 fear and so now we've Associated and
01:19:26.040 then we ask the next question which is
01:19:28.280 ready to rock and roll and no like there
01:19:30.280 it's like you can even feel feel my tone
01:19:32.080 change in how I'm saying like you ready
01:19:33.239 to go ready to rock let's do this right
01:19:36.280 and so that's how I like overcoming lots
01:19:39.400 of stall uh stalls which is what you're
01:19:41.239 being concerned what are the variables
01:19:42.320 you're make using to make the decision
01:19:43.520 what would it take for this to be a yes
01:19:45.760 and what makes this a no right all great
01:19:48.800 ways of segmenting around it without
01:19:50.880 even having to get into more of the uh
01:19:53.600 standard closes
01:19:55.360 around uh I have to think about it to
01:19:57.480 give me some more time so one of the big
01:19:59.679 things that I like to train with our
01:20:00.960 team is something that I call allpurpose
01:20:02.639 closes and so allpurpose closes are the
01:20:05.320 are the
01:20:06.040 8020 um of closes so these are closes
01:20:09.960 that uh pretty much work in all
01:20:11.520 situations so you have to know price
01:20:13.760 overcomes you have to know stall
01:20:15.080 overcomes you have to know decision
01:20:16.360 maker overcomes you have to know
01:20:17.920 preference overcomes so that's when
01:20:19.320 somebody's like I don't like this
01:20:20.719 particular feature or I don't like it
01:20:22.320 that you do it this way um you to have
01:20:24.960 overcomes for all those things but the
01:20:26.520 allpurpose closes uh work in pretty much
01:20:29.880 all scenarios because all of them
01:20:31.440 basically chunk up and get yourself out
01:20:33.760 of the weed so you can just make the big
01:20:35.280 decision overall so an allp purpose
01:20:37.199 close might sound like do you think the
01:20:38.360 reason that you're on the phone today is
01:20:39.520 because you've struggled to make this
01:20:40.639 decision in the past and so that works
01:20:43.000 no matter what thing that they're
01:20:45.040 they're bringing up whether it's their
01:20:46.320 spouse it's money and you just call it
01:20:48.040 the reason so it's like oh do you think
01:20:50.000 like I think it's a lot of money say do
01:20:52.080 you think that uh the fact that you
01:20:54.320 hav't invested in the past is the reason
01:20:56.000 that you're not successful right uh I
01:20:58.560 need to talk to my spouse do you think
01:20:59.600 the reason that you haven't been
01:21:00.840 successful so far is because you've
01:21:02.840 needed to talk to your spouse for all
01:21:04.080 these things you've always needed to get
01:21:05.679 permission do you feel like the fact
01:21:07.840 that you struggled to make decisions in
01:21:09.040 the past is why you're on the phone with
01:21:10.239 me today so like it doesn't matter what
01:21:11.639 it is is whatever they say you say you
01:21:13.040 think the reason like you just take
01:21:14.639 their objection and add do you think
01:21:16.120 that's the reason that you haven't
01:21:17.080 succeeded because they haven't succeeded
01:21:18.440 yet that's the thing that you have to
01:21:19.840 your advantage they're on the phone they
01:21:21.199 have the pain and so you just say
01:21:22.600 whatever their thing is that's the
01:21:24.120 reason right now there's another one
01:21:26.199 which is just the the 1 to 10 Close
01:21:27.679 which is hey on a scale from 1 to 10 uh
01:21:29.920 10 being you know Fair let's do this one
01:21:32.679 being like let's let's never talk to
01:21:34.600 Alex again your breath stinks I hate you
01:21:36.719 uh you know where we at now it doesn't
01:21:38.600 really matter what they say you just say
01:21:40.679 after that well what would make it a 10
01:21:42.719 which is another version of like what
01:21:44.000 would it take right but just framed
01:21:45.639 differently so what would it take now if
01:21:47.480 they say a six then you can also say why
01:21:50.080 not a one and they're like well because
01:21:51.719 you're great and you're awesome and all
01:21:53.080 these things then you have them say it
01:21:54.360 not you and you're like awesome so what
01:21:56.400 would make this aent and sometimes they
01:21:57.760 just give you the one or two things like
01:21:59.120 oh I must have done a poor job of commun
01:22:00.840 that we'll totally take care of that for
01:22:02.360 you so sometimes they bring up features
01:22:04.280 that they specifically wanted or some
01:22:06.159 element that you can reframe your
01:22:07.600 existing stack and just saying oh we
01:22:09.080 satisfy that problem for you I just
01:22:10.280 didn't communicate that well are we
01:22:11.639 feeling tennish is how I like to say it
01:22:13.679 we feeling tennish awesome let's get go
01:22:15.760 let's get going right so allpurpose
01:22:17.360 closes you should know like the back of
01:22:20.199 your hand there's a bunch of other ones
01:22:22.520 I'll just leave it there otherwise the
01:22:23.600 whole rest of the video would be over
01:22:24.520 overcomes with allpurpose causes the
01:22:26.159 next one is a big big big one which is
01:22:29.360 details are death traps all right and
01:22:32.120 the reason that deals are lost in the
01:22:34.639 details is because not for what you
01:22:37.920 think the reason that details lose deals
01:22:40.600 and that they are death traps and let's
01:22:42.040 see if I can use more deal iteration is
01:22:44.840 because you don't get to pick whether
01:22:47.360 your answers are correct or not so if
01:22:49.679 someone says hey how many days a week
01:22:51.920 are you open if you answer I call that a
01:22:54.600 blind answer so it's basically you
01:22:56.520 rolling the dice that whatever you say
01:22:58.679 is the right answer which you never want
01:23:00.360 to do as a Salesman and so whenever
01:23:02.760 someone's asking a question about a
01:23:04.679 detail what I train our team to do is
01:23:07.120 ask a question about their question and
01:23:09.159 so we say oh well how many days were you
01:23:11.159 looking for or what days a week were you
01:23:12.960 do you need it to be open right because
01:23:14.719 now based on their answer I can then
01:23:16.960 hedge or frame my answer in a way that
01:23:19.280 increases the likelihood that we close
01:23:21.440 and so kind of like lawyers when they're
01:23:23.360 cross cross-examining uh you know uh
01:23:26.480 somebody on the stand they never ask
01:23:28.080 questions they already don't know the
01:23:29.120 answers to and so you as a Salesman
01:23:30.920 should never answer questions you don't
01:23:32.679 already know the answers to and if
01:23:34.440 someone really presses hard on something
01:23:37.159 this is where you appeal to the
01:23:38.560 authority of the business rather than
01:23:40.280 yourself and so you say hey totally fair
01:23:44.440 question I would say it's kind of like
01:23:46.800 asking the secretary at the heart
01:23:48.560 surgeon's place like what's wrong with
01:23:50.440 your heart without having seen the heart
01:23:52.159 surgeon yet or the alternative this is
01:23:54.719 the mechanic close which is like hey I
01:23:56.800 totally get this is super important um I
01:23:59.560 can't ethically answer your question
01:24:01.159 right now because we haven't brought
01:24:02.400 your car into the shop yet right so be
01:24:04.120 like you asking you know a mechanic hey
01:24:05.840 what's wrong with my car before you
01:24:07.000 brought it in like we got to look under
01:24:08.239 the hood before we can tell you what's
01:24:09.639 going on with it and I used to use this
01:24:11.679 whether it was hey I can't I can't tell
01:24:13.719 you what's wrong with your diet they' be
01:24:14.920 like hey well what kind of diet are you
01:24:16.000 going to be giving me I'd be like
01:24:17.040 honestly it's going to depend and so
01:24:18.719 it's going to depend on these things and
01:24:19.960 this is where you close it you say and
01:24:21.960 if anyone ever gives you an answer
01:24:24.800 before looking at that stuff run the
01:24:26.679 other way because they're just trying to
01:24:27.840 sell you stuff they're not trying to
01:24:29.040 help and so as soon as you say that you
01:24:30.960 have the moral High Ground done you're
01:24:32.719 out of the details you're out of the
01:24:33.719 weeds and you zoom out right and again a
01:24:36.440 lot of these a lot of these allpurpose
01:24:37.880 closes zoom out because people get lost
01:24:40.080 in the details they try and find
01:24:41.360 something to nitpick and every
01:24:42.679 salesman's experience knows that like
01:24:44.199 you die in the details one because it's
01:24:46.320 not your expertise two they get to tell
01:24:48.400 you what's right and so you want both of
01:24:49.920 those are terrible things that you want
01:24:51.080 to avoid and so this is where hey
01:24:53.719 sometimes you have to to say I'm be like
01:24:55.159 hey before we get deep you know deeper
01:24:57.400 in this fundamentally you want this
01:25:00.719 outcome we sell this outcome what's get
01:25:03.800 in the way here all right and where we
01:25:06.119 get into details and this is the theory
01:25:07.840 behind this that you should understand
01:25:09.639 is that a detail obstacle is actually a
01:25:12.960 preference obstacle meaning I want to
01:25:15.320 have my cake and eat it too I want your
01:25:17.600 results but I want them my way you can't
01:25:20.040 have that and so one of the ways you can
01:25:21.320 overcome this is this is specific to a a
01:25:23.760 detail CL close you say Hey you change
01:25:25.520 the variables you change the outcome I
01:25:26.840 can tell you that if you do things our
01:25:28.679 way we'll get this outcome and I also
01:25:30.159 know from what you told me earlier pain
01:25:32.520 cycle that you've tried a lot of other
01:25:34.520 ways and what you have been doing hasn't
01:25:36.000 been working for you see I'm lowering my
01:25:37.800 tone I'm seeing really reasonable right
01:25:40.040 um it hasn't been working for you and so
01:25:41.719 like if you're willing to give this a
01:25:42.719 shot I know that these are the numbers
01:25:44.320 that we can do if you follow this
01:25:45.719 process does that sound fair right and
01:25:47.960 when you say it like that you sound very
01:25:49.280 reasonable and then you can close and so
01:25:51.840 a lot of times when you get caught in
01:25:52.840 the details it's because they want
01:25:53.920 things their way and they want your
01:25:56.440 outcome and you can't have both I'd have
01:25:58.440 people say hey uh I I see this meal plan
01:26:01.000 can I just eat what I'm eating uh on the
01:26:02.480 challenge I'm like no because I was like
01:26:03.880 because eating what your eating's got in
01:26:04.960 the body that you got I was like and you
01:26:06.639 want this body which doesn't come from
01:26:07.800 that food and if you're talking to a
01:26:09.000 business owner now obviously like I have
01:26:10.800 to have poor to make that joke um but if
01:26:13.000 it's a business owner it's like no you
01:26:14.360 can't keep doing what you're doing right
01:26:15.560 you can hear my tone change no you can't
01:26:17.199 do it keep doing what you're doing
01:26:18.440 because doing what you're doing is
01:26:19.360 gotten you where you gotten right you
01:26:21.199 got to change to change right and so
01:26:22.920 that's like it always usually levels up
01:26:24.639 so you got to change to change you got
01:26:25.600 to change the got to change the
01:26:26.880 variables to change the outcome right so
01:26:29.679 don't get lost in the details and the
01:26:32.600 first response to any detail question is
01:26:34.920 asking why they care about the detail
01:26:37.000 and so you want to ask specifics about
01:26:38.280 the detail so if someone would say hey
01:26:40.040 uh you know what what certifications do
01:26:41.480 your trainers have i' be like which
01:26:42.520 certifications you looking for and
01:26:43.840 they'd be like uh I don't know it's like
01:26:45.480 right and i' be like it sounds like you
01:26:47.040 just want to make sure that you're
01:26:47.639 making inform decision what I can tell
01:26:49.159 you is right and so I was always what I
01:26:51.560 can tell you is and I I it's like it's
01:26:53.920 muscle mus memory uh what I can tell you
01:26:55.880 is is that each of my trainers are
01:26:57.000 certified in three different ways and
01:26:58.199 they're master trainers because they've
01:26:59.159 done over a thousand sessions because
01:27:00.280 I'm guessing the reason that you're
01:27:02.239 trying to ask that question is because
01:27:03.400 you want to make sure that you're safe
01:27:04.560 does that sound fair yes well let me
01:27:06.199 tell you this we haven't had a single
01:27:07.679 injury in the last two years does that
01:27:09.400 make you feel better great boom right
01:27:11.400 and so you want to Chunk Up the reason
01:27:13.199 behind the detail and so if they say hey
01:27:15.480 how many you know how many emails can I
01:27:17.159 send to your support team let's say you
01:27:18.600 had you had no emails for your support
01:27:20.199 team you'd say well one how many
01:27:22.840 questions were you looking for right and
01:27:24.719 then they're never going to be able
01:27:25.480 answer that question but even if they
01:27:26.679 did you'd say well it sounds like the
01:27:29.320 main reason that you want to again
01:27:30.800 reason the reason behind the reason that
01:27:32.719 you want that is because you just want
01:27:33.840 to make sure that you fully understand
01:27:35.440 things if you fully understood things
01:27:36.840 hypothetical if you fully understood
01:27:38.679 exactly what to do would you have
01:27:40.360 questions well no great well then if we
01:27:43.760 just make sure that you understand
01:27:44.920 exactly what you like you don't leave
01:27:46.280 the sessions with our team without
01:27:48.239 knowing exactly what you're going to do
01:27:49.880 you understand every single one of those
01:27:51.520 points that you'd feel okay great well
01:27:53.360 that's what we're going to do ready rock
01:27:54.320 and roll right and so you can you never
01:27:56.719 want to get in the details you either
01:27:58.400 question the detail or circumvent it by
01:28:00.840 trying to guess the reason behind the
01:28:02.159 detail and then chunking up and closing
01:28:03.560 that way but details are where you die
01:28:05.800 and finally of course you can mechanic
01:28:07.440 close or secretary close your way out of
01:28:09.159 it and say hey I can't ethically answer
01:28:11.360 that question because we got to bring
01:28:13.040 your car in and look under the hood
01:28:14.320 before we can actually give you an
01:28:15.199 honest answer and it's going to depend
01:28:17.520 so the next one is the AAA system now I
01:28:19.880 made an entire training on this because
01:28:21.239 it's so important but I'm just G to give
01:28:22.480 you the high level on it which is
01:28:24.280 whenever someone asks you uh a question
01:28:27.880 or they give you some sort of objection
01:28:30.040 you want to follow the Tria framework
01:28:32.000 and I realized this only years into
01:28:34.199 teaching sales that this is what
01:28:35.639 separated my top salespeople from my
01:28:37.639 mediocre sales people and they did it
01:28:39.119 naturally and I never caught it which is
01:28:41.199 that they first
01:28:42.560 acknowledge what the person said so the
01:28:45.159 reason you do this is twofold one is
01:28:47.119 because it buys you time to think about
01:28:49.159 what you're going to say next because uh
01:28:50.880 they say something you repeat it back to
01:28:52.239 them it's like oh so it sounds like
01:28:53.560 right it's you basically say the last
01:28:55.040 phrase back to them so it buys you time
01:28:57.480 and when someone hears you rephrase what
01:28:59.960 they just said it builds Rapport because
01:29:02.199 it looks like you're actively listening
01:29:03.400 which you should be and so one you keep
01:29:05.520 Rapport and you give yourself a little
01:29:07.520 bit of time a little bit of breathing
01:29:08.560 room then you
01:29:11.280 associate what they said with either
01:29:13.760 something positive which is like hey
01:29:15.320 that's a smart question or that's
01:29:16.320 amazing or uh totally understandable
01:29:18.080 like those are just I would say generic
01:29:19.400 neutral associations or you make an
01:29:22.000 association with someone that you just
01:29:23.719 talked to earlier that day somebody who
01:29:25.840 used the product and loved it and got
01:29:27.600 amazing success or some Authority in the
01:29:30.280 business who gave you Insight that they
01:29:31.520 don't know so it's like that's an
01:29:32.800 amazing question I actually just talked
01:29:33.960 to our senior engineer earlier today and
01:29:35.320 he actually told me this can I share it
01:29:36.840 with you right that allows you to sell a
01:29:38.960 harsh truth to somebody without actually
01:29:40.760 attacking their character and so if
01:29:42.480 someone says something uh that's way off
01:29:44.520 I'd be like totally understand where
01:29:45.840 you're coming from uh I think it's a
01:29:47.480 super fair question do you mind if I uh
01:29:49.520 share something that I talked to someone
01:29:50.960 earlier this morning had the same issue
01:29:52.360 as you and it helped them get over it
01:29:54.520 now again I'm not now saying this to you
01:29:56.960 I'm telling you what I told them and I
01:29:58.480 just happen to be telling you so I'm not
01:30:00.119 insulting you I'm telling you my harsher
01:30:02.000 truth that I told this person and then
01:30:03.320 you can connect the dots and so by
01:30:05.239 having those associations it creates
01:30:07.119 foils for people's egos so you can have
01:30:09.280 more direct conversation indirectly and
01:30:11.880 then the last part is obviously just ask
01:30:14.040 so you acknowledge you associate then
01:30:16.080 you ask the next question and that's how
01:30:17.800 you move forward in the sale because
01:30:19.199 this is a law that you must understand
01:30:21.119 about
01:30:22.119 closing key
01:30:25.000 who
01:30:26.679 asks the
01:30:29.639 most
01:30:32.560 times
01:30:34.199 gets the
01:30:36.840 most
01:30:39.280 sales this is a law he who asks the most
01:30:43.119 times gets the most sales and the reason
01:30:46.040 that this is so important is because
01:30:48.639 asking when you ask wrong usually loses
01:30:51.320 you sales and because they don't want to
01:30:53.199 talk to you anymore and so if they get
01:30:55.360 into a bad mood they don't buy and so
01:30:57.840 how do you reconcile asking a lot of
01:31:00.000 times closing the most sales with when
01:31:02.480 you ask wrong people stop wanting to
01:31:04.280 talk to you therefore you can't ask more
01:31:05.760 times what Bridges this Rapport and so
01:31:09.119 the reason this is so important is
01:31:11.600 because it gives you unlimited shots on
01:31:13.159 goal you stay in the saddle you stay in
01:31:15.719 the sale rather than getting knocked off
01:31:17.400 and you can tell when someone's complete
01:31:18.920 demeanor changes they close off you've
01:31:20.360 already lost the sale right you lost
01:31:21.840 them you lost Rapport and so by ackn
01:31:23.920 ning what they say associating with
01:31:25.400 something positive or someone positive
01:31:27.080 someone like them who got this big
01:31:28.320 result it allows you to say harsher
01:31:30.639 overcomes that allow you to move the
01:31:32.440 sale forward two three steps rather than
01:31:34.639 just kind of like for lack of a better
01:31:35.920 term footing around it and so this
01:31:38.679 is what allows the best sales people to
01:31:40.480 ask hard truths because closers ask hard
01:31:43.760 questions so In The Same Spirit as this
01:31:47.119 in order to keep this whole tone I like
01:31:49.440 to remind my team childlike curiosity
01:31:54.159 and the point of this is that you want
01:31:56.520 to understand not win and so if someone
01:32:00.800 doesn't immediately buy it should be
01:32:03.040 your first instinct to not be like screw
01:32:05.840 this person I'm going to hard close them
01:32:07.480 because it probably won't work instead
01:32:09.360 being like huh that's interesting I
01:32:11.080 wouldn't have expected that can you tell
01:32:12.400 me more about that or hey so all of
01:32:14.600 these things are different ways of
01:32:16.960 acknowledging and so I even taught this
01:32:19.639 to uh our team and I you can even see it
01:32:22.199 with my head when I say huh I always
01:32:24.560 tilt my head up because that's how I
01:32:25.920 naturally am curious and so when someone
01:32:27.800 does this you're not like oh this guy's
01:32:29.719 going to try and be combative with me
01:32:31.000 it's like huh that's interesting and so
01:32:33.199 that one buys you more time it also
01:32:35.400 isn't competitive it's not you attacking
01:32:37.800 them it's you not trying to prove them
01:32:39.880 wrong because if you prove them wrong
01:32:41.960 you make no money so you want to be
01:32:43.960 right not rich the classic ISM you
01:32:46.840 become rich by making them right because
01:32:49.520 they believe nothing about what you say
01:32:51.159 they believe everything about what they
01:32:52.600 say and so the reason that sales people
01:32:54.199 ask questions because we need them to
01:32:55.480 say it not us so within that context
01:32:59.320 because closers ask hard questions and
01:33:01.280 because we are curious that means that
01:33:03.080 we ask more questions and so what a lot
01:33:06.040 of people don't know is the person
01:33:08.600 asking is the person
01:33:10.840 closing so there's a reason that when
01:33:12.840 you're in an interrogation they're like
01:33:14.159 I'm asking the questions here it's
01:33:15.480 because the person asking the questions
01:33:17.320 is the one who's in control you're the
01:33:19.880 one who's leading the sale because the
01:33:21.639 questions guide the conversation the
01:33:23.159 answers do not
01:33:24.440 and so you want to be the the spirit
01:33:26.600 guide who's letting your questions guide
01:33:29.320 the person to the Natural conclusion and
01:33:31.119 so fundamentally sales is an education
01:33:32.920 process and so our goal is to Simply
01:33:35.040 figure out what pieces of information
01:33:37.000 they need in order to make a decision
01:33:39.119 and act on it and so if we think about
01:33:41.280 sales as teaching because teaching is
01:33:43.520 same conditions new Behavior then we
01:33:45.199 want them to now have a new Behavior
01:33:46.600 which is buying which we've motivated
01:33:47.880 them to do by pointing out the
01:33:49.880 deprivation they've had in their lives
01:33:51.360 and presenting our solution as the thing
01:33:53.159 that will Bridge that Gap and so if
01:33:56.679 someone asks you questions it's like hot
01:33:58.719 potato that's why we ask a question back
01:34:02.080 because we Take Back Control the reason
01:34:04.920 the details are death is because they
01:34:06.679 are asking you questions they are in
01:34:08.760 control not you the other reason that
01:34:11.199 questions are so powerful is that no one
01:34:14.400 can disagree with a question all right
01:34:17.119 so it doesn't matter what what they say
01:34:20.320 if you just ask a question about it
01:34:22.520 there's they can't disagree with the
01:34:23.560 question question which makes you like
01:34:25.320 smoke and so this is my little ISM that
01:34:27.000 I like telling my team is that you want
01:34:28.199 to be like smoke like they can't catch
01:34:29.880 you like any any statement that you give
01:34:33.239 is an opportunity for them to disagree
01:34:35.400 and we want to never disagree with
01:34:36.840 prospects now some people might disagree
01:34:38.480 with that and I don't care uh and so the
01:34:41.600 thing is is you don't disagree with
01:34:43.440 prospects because the likely that you
01:34:44.560 lose Report with the prospect super high
01:34:46.600 you can agree with the reason behind the
01:34:50.239 question you can agree or say that it's
01:34:52.480 understandable for them to have a
01:34:53.400 question
01:34:54.159 but you don't want to disagree so
01:34:55.440 there's very different saying don't
01:34:56.880 disagree with agreeing with everything
01:34:58.520 they say very different you just don't
01:35:00.440 want to create a competitive environment
01:35:02.520 and so questions allow you to have that
01:35:04.800 Gap and so statements are bombs that
01:35:07.520 they can then blow up in your face and
01:35:09.239 so if we are ever going to answer things
01:35:11.920 we check to see what answer they want
01:35:14.239 and then say it and so they say hey what
01:35:16.880 kind of food's on the plan I say what
01:35:18.440 kind of food you looking for hey what
01:35:19.880 are your workouts like well what
01:35:21.119 workouts you looking for right like and
01:35:23.040 then they say well I was hoping you do
01:35:24.360 some sort of cardan Weights well that's
01:35:25.639 exactly what you do you're in luck right
01:35:27.360 because they just told me the answer and
01:35:28.960 so it's amazing at the end of this
01:35:30.520 they're like dude this sounds exactly
01:35:31.800 like what I want I'm like yes because
01:35:33.040 you told me what you wanted and I told
01:35:34.280 you that's what it was now again you
01:35:36.239 want to be ethical and making sure that
01:35:38.000 you're not deceiving people but I think
01:35:40.400 it's way more about how you frame the
01:35:42.920 solution right if I say hey what kind of
01:35:45.960 workouts you looking for and they say uh
01:35:48.800 I want to do a lot of cardio and if I
01:35:51.119 know that there's no cardio in our thing
01:35:53.119 for example I might be like why and
01:35:55.159 they'd be like uh well I heard that
01:35:56.880 that's what I need to lose weight and
01:35:58.239 I'm like what if we could help you lose
01:35:59.960 weight and you wouldn't have to do card
01:36:00.880 you would still want to do it and then
01:36:02.960 they probably like well yeah and be like
01:36:04.520 awesome well let's focus on that because
01:36:06.520 this is what I can help you do do you
01:36:08.760 care a lot about how we get there and a
01:36:10.280 lot of times most people are like no as
01:36:11.600 long as you get me there and so this
01:36:13.280 again Loops us out it gets you into you
01:36:16.400 want cake you also want to eat it let me
01:36:18.520 just get you cake and then we can I
01:36:20.280 don't know what you do with cake if
01:36:21.280 you're not eating it but that's where
01:36:22.960 that
01:36:24.199 and then we can throw it there we go all
01:36:25.840 right so even though
01:36:28.199 we're point being is that you either
01:36:30.760 question questions or you ask the right
01:36:33.840 answer from the person before answering
01:36:35.760 it and so if you think about this as the
01:36:37.840 decision trait someone ask a detail
01:36:39.600 question you then ask a question what's
01:36:41.719 the right answer to this question they
01:36:43.199 then tell you the right answer if you
01:36:44.600 have the right answer you say great
01:36:45.920 that's what we have if they if you don't
01:36:47.719 have that as the right answer you ask
01:36:49.119 why they have that and then you chunk up
01:36:50.480 to the reason behind it and then say if
01:36:52.080 we got to that same solution either way
01:36:53.719 would you care about how we got there
01:36:55.080 both of those note got you out of the
01:36:56.960 details and you never answered a
01:36:58.280 question you didn't already know the
01:36:59.119 answer to as we're going through these
01:37:00.520 closing things right rather than make
01:37:01.880 this an entire thing of just obstacle
01:37:03.480 overcomes um I I really want to tease up
01:37:06.080 to the the the strategy behind this
01:37:08.520 rather than just heav you know shout
01:37:09.920 lines at you all right and so we talk
01:37:12.639 about killing zombies early another way
01:37:14.679 of thinking about is like you want to
01:37:15.719 diffuse the bomb before you get into the
01:37:17.920 cloth um and the reason that we do
01:37:20.520 zombies is because if zombies get close
01:37:22.040 to you they eat you and they bite you
01:37:23.400 right so you want to kill them from a
01:37:24.520 distance before they get close all right
01:37:26.639 and so you handle zombies earlier on in
01:37:28.760 the sale and so if you recall from bant
01:37:31.080 these are typically going to be your
01:37:32.320 zombies right budget Authority need
01:37:34.320 timing hey is there anyone else that
01:37:36.080 needs to uh be on the call or involved
01:37:37.679 in this decision hey uh just to be clear
01:37:39.880 the reason that we do the labeling up
01:37:41.199 front that gives us the need right
01:37:43.480 timing like are you good to start now
01:37:45.960 when would you like to start if we were
01:37:47.560 to move forward right budget some of
01:37:50.239 these things you can ask in the
01:37:51.119 application you can ask them the
01:37:52.159 qualifier but when you ask them in the
01:37:54.199 pain cycle for example and this is where
01:37:55.840 you can actually collect all your gold
01:37:57.239 for this is when you ask what they've
01:37:58.719 done in the past you can get an idea of
01:38:00.920 what their need was what the timing was
01:38:03.040 what the budget was hey was your husband
01:38:04.800 involved in that decision right and so
01:38:06.920 you can collect all the data you need
01:38:08.360 around B before getting to the close and
01:38:11.199 so if you consistently have a few things
01:38:13.920 that come up in the close and blow up in
01:38:15.520 you then you want to just load those
01:38:17.639 earlier in the sale before you ask for
01:38:19.760 money because anything that you ask for
01:38:22.320 after making money is when you're in the
01:38:23.760 very very uh tight RPP area if if you're
01:38:26.679 asking to overcome those things before
01:38:28.920 money there's no Stakes on the table yet
01:38:30.800 I like to tell my team literally in
01:38:32.719 person you always want to be on the same
01:38:33.880 side of the table if you're via Zoom or
01:38:36.320 phone you want to figuratively be on the
01:38:37.840 same side of the table they want to feel
01:38:38.800 like you're an ally you you going to be
01:38:39.880 shoulder Tosh shoulder you be across the
01:38:41.239 corner of the table not across the table
01:38:43.199 overall and so when you're in the
01:38:45.560 beginning of the sale you want to be a
01:38:47.040 FactFinder you want to be a guide right
01:38:49.960 if you're positioned as a helpful guide
01:38:51.480 throughout this whole process then you'd
01:38:53.560 asking these questions are things that
01:38:55.360 are going to help you help them if
01:38:57.280 you're asking them after you've asked
01:38:58.599 for money it's a way for you to extract
01:39:00.560 money from them and so it shifts the
01:39:02.000 frame when you ask these questions and
01:39:03.320 these are all answerable prior to asking
01:39:05.960 for money another one is just a little
01:39:07.560 ISM which is a when in doubt repeat it
01:39:09.199 back or one in doubt say it back uh and
01:39:11.840 that's because if you're like Oh shoot
01:39:13.159 what am I going to say you can just
01:39:14.560 always just pause be like so you want to
01:39:17.560 know which certifications our trainers
01:39:21.679 have and they're just going to look at
01:39:22.920 you like yes okay I was just thinking
01:39:25.400 about the stuff that we have which ones
01:39:26.800 are you looking for specifically right
01:39:28.360 and so that gives you that time to to
01:39:30.760 come up with whatever your answer so if
01:39:31.920 you get into into ghost mode you can
01:39:33.800 always just slowly say back what they
01:39:36.679 just asked you and you'll still stay in
01:39:38.480 the sale and keep report rather than
01:39:40.199 having a long awkward silence so when in
01:39:44.719 doubt say it
01:39:49.960 back all right so the next one is
01:39:54.599 before
01:39:56.679 getting
01:39:59.719 real get
01:40:03.280 permission so I would say that this
01:40:05.560 depends on your frame within the sale
01:40:07.639 and so if you're seen as an authority
01:40:09.599 then you can say hey can I be a coach
01:40:11.800 instead of a friend here hey can I put
01:40:13.280 my uh can I put my real hat on hey do
01:40:14.840 you mind if I get real with you for a
01:40:16.000 second before before we move on so these
01:40:18.280 are all ways to uh gain permission
01:40:22.119 before giving someone a harsh truth now
01:40:23.960 if you're in a sale let's say you're a
01:40:25.880 20-year- old guy and you're closing you
01:40:27.440 know 40-year-old business owners that
01:40:29.000 are doing $20 million a year that's
01:40:30.920 probably not going to work right and so
01:40:32.920 that's where the other three foils that
01:40:34.520 I brought up in the associate part of
01:40:36.400 that sounds like somebody else just like
01:40:37.880 you because now it's using the authority
01:40:39.199 of somebody else like them which is
01:40:40.360 their own authority uh using again
01:40:42.560 Someone Like You Who Saw success it's
01:40:44.040 just a different version or if there's
01:40:45.679 an authority in the business or the
01:40:47.840 product that you can lean on so hey our
01:40:49.280 senior engineer oh our founder those are
01:40:51.320 things that as long as your founder
01:40:52.560 which presumably if they're coming to
01:40:53.960 the business you Le they have some
01:40:55.480 Authority if they're thinking about
01:40:56.679 working with you um then that gives you
01:40:59.360 some Authority that the salesman can
01:41:00.560 then transfer in giving a hard truth um
01:41:03.520 and so but this that's the common
01:41:05.199 language before you're going to say
01:41:06.159 something harsh if you ever heard a
01:41:07.360 close or read a close and be like dude I
01:41:09.280 don't think I could say that it's
01:41:10.599 usually because you didn't triaa
01:41:12.040 beforehand right you didn't acknowledge
01:41:13.880 what they said associate with what they
01:41:15.520 said reframe it uh and then ask the
01:41:17.800 question with some sort of like can I be
01:41:20.000 a coach and said of a friend here uh or
01:41:21.920 would it be totally overstepping for me
01:41:23.880 to uh share this harsh truth with you
01:41:25.800 and I say not harsh truth so be like
01:41:28.239 that thing hey would it be totally
01:41:29.239 overstepping um if I shared something
01:41:30.920 with you that might be uncomfortable uh
01:41:33.040 right um can I tell you what I told
01:41:35.400 somebody in your exact same position
01:41:36.960 right now that's that's an example of
01:41:38.440 the foil Association rather than the
01:41:39.920 first two if I'm selling consumer weight
01:41:41.719 loss you can get away with the first two
01:41:43.159 if someone's coming to you for weight
01:41:44.480 loss coaching you can say can I be a
01:41:45.840 coach inside of a friend it makes sense
01:41:47.000 you're starting that relationship if
01:41:48.440 you're just a Salesman stick with the
01:41:50.480 foils that I was mentioned earlier next
01:41:52.159 one is uh learn to stack closes all
01:41:55.520 right so something that you'll notice or
01:41:57.159 at least me in my my career um selling
01:42:00.599 is that some it's like it's sometimes
01:42:02.599 they're like on the fence they're on the
01:42:03.960 edge and they're like teetering that's
01:42:05.840 where you want to like right hook jab
01:42:07.719 jab ja like you want to just like ah and
01:42:09.400 then and push them over um so I don't I
01:42:12.400 don't know if I subscribe to the uh
01:42:14.400 whoever talks first after you uh mention
01:42:17.480 money like money maybe but um I can tell
01:42:21.520 you I've closed plenty of sales where
01:42:22.800 like I could like hey seems like you're
01:42:24.440 hesitating right let me like let's let's
01:42:27.320 let's close this up more um but in the
01:42:31.159 vast majority now obviously with a price
01:42:32.719 drop uh sometimes you do want to wait
01:42:34.800 but the vast majority of other times
01:42:36.520 when I have a big pause I'll just insert
01:42:39.639 more closes from different angles around
01:42:41.760 the same uh obstacle so if someone's
01:42:44.360 saying hey for example I don't have a
01:42:46.159 lot of time right now then I'm going to
01:42:48.360 know one I'll Attack on the fact that
01:42:50.159 hey the first thing we're going to do is
01:42:51.159 cut out 90% of the stuff that you that's
01:42:52.679 not working because that's why you're
01:42:53.960 here so that you will be spending your
01:42:55.960 time doing the stuff that matters I also
01:42:57.880 know be like hey at the end of the day
01:42:59.199 this is a question of priori it's not
01:43:00.639 time right because everybody has it and
01:43:01.719 there's other people in your industry
01:43:02.679 who are growing faster than you and they
01:43:04.199 have the same resources so we just need
01:43:05.400 to allocate them differently right um
01:43:08.480 and then I could go from a a macro busy
01:43:10.560 perspective which is well I understand
01:43:12.400 that you're totally busy I think it's
01:43:13.320 really reasonable that that you say that
01:43:15.320 um so let me ask you a question do you
01:43:17.080 think that you ever going to be not busy
01:43:19.119 again in the future this is a trap
01:43:20.360 they're going to say yes and say cool do
01:43:21.920 you ever think you'll be busy again in
01:43:22.920 the the future and now they're like well
01:43:25.080 yeah it's like okay well if you can't
01:43:27.480 succeed when you're busy then it means
01:43:28.800 that you'll fall off when you're busy
01:43:30.040 again and so if you want this to be
01:43:31.639 permanent then we have to figure out how
01:43:32.800 to make it work during all seasons does
01:43:35.040 that sound fair does that make sense got
01:43:36.719 it and so now it's like I just had three
01:43:39.159 different ways and so whichever one I
01:43:40.880 said first if they're like still
01:43:42.639 thinking about it I like if I just said
01:43:44.440 the seasons one I'd be like hey and no
01:43:46.320 matter what we're going to cut out 90%
01:43:48.320 of the stuff that you're doing right now
01:43:49.400 so we're going to save you that time so
01:43:50.679 you can start doing the stuff that
01:43:51.719 matters right because it's going to be
01:43:53.239 ities not how much time you got right
01:43:55.159 everybody's got the same amount of time
01:43:56.199 right okay cool right and so I just went
01:43:58.520 three closes in a row after as the after
01:44:01.639 making the first one and so learning how
01:44:03.280 to stack closes and weave them together
01:44:05.119 will make all your closing more
01:44:06.280 effective and this is why knowing the
01:44:08.199 theory behind the close is more
01:44:10.040 important than trying to memorize what
01:44:12.480 close it is which kind of brings me to
01:44:14.080 this um the next one is I think there's
01:44:16.560 a lot of guys who say to memorize closes
01:44:18.760 I couldn't even tell you uh I don't
01:44:21.360 think I've really hard poor memorized
01:44:23.719 any clo I know the gist of almost all of
01:44:26.480 them word for word not really uh
01:44:30.280 so don't don't
01:44:33.440 memorize understand and so let me walk
01:44:36.920 you through the big understandings that
01:44:39.320 you have to have all right so if someone
01:44:40.880 comes with a Time objection they're too
01:44:43.280 busy then it's really understanding
01:44:45.520 that's a prioritization thing that's all
01:44:47.560 it is so we have to allocate the
01:44:49.199 resources differently that's all the
01:44:51.000 closes that are going to be around time
01:44:52.320 are going to be around that
01:44:53.719 a decision maker close is going to be
01:44:55.400 around you want support not permission
01:44:57.719 right so they're going to ask for
01:44:58.679 permission you're going to try and
01:44:59.480 empower the person saying hey we're
01:45:00.800 going to rely on past behaviors this
01:45:02.400 person has said we're going to fact find
01:45:04.239 to say oh you know what it turns out
01:45:05.440 they've done all these other things that
01:45:06.560 would indicate that they're already okay
01:45:07.840 with you making this decision and so I
01:45:09.480 think you want to go for support not
01:45:11.360 permission it's better to ask for
01:45:12.239 forgiveness than permission ha right and
01:45:14.280 so you can make those make those little
01:45:16.119 isms but all of those are going to
01:45:17.280 circle around that that main thing if
01:45:19.320 someone's saying details it's going to
01:45:21.400 be preferences it's going to say want
01:45:23.239 your thing my way and so we need to
01:45:24.920 overcome the fact that if they change
01:45:26.080 the variables they change the outcome uh
01:45:27.920 and all the closes around details are
01:45:29.440 more or less going to be around
01:45:31.280 basically that fundamental line of
01:45:32.679 reasoning um if someone says money then
01:45:36.320 you're going to basically zero in on
01:45:38.520 value because nothing is ever too
01:45:40.639 expensive it's just not worth it right
01:45:43.280 if I was giving you a Ferrari for five
01:45:44.639 grand you would find a way to come up
01:45:46.159 with five grand of course which then
01:45:48.119 leads to the second underlying one which
01:45:50.040 is about resourcefulness not resource
01:45:53.080 ources because if you really thought
01:45:55.760 that this was going to be the thing that
01:45:56.840 was going to change your life you'd find
01:45:57.960 a way to make it work right if I were
01:45:59.560 giving you the keys to my Ferrari for
01:46:01.159 five grand you would call 10 friends and
01:46:03.199 get the money together which means
01:46:04.639 fundamentally you don't see the value
01:46:06.560 and so every one of the obstacles that
01:46:08.880 people will throw at you you just need
01:46:10.880 to understand the fundamental fallacy of
01:46:15.159 belief that they're presenting with so
01:46:16.679 that you can help overcome it and stall
01:46:19.320 overcomes the last kind of category are
01:46:22.000 stalls link back to decision avoidance
01:46:25.800 so it's typically either fear uh of
01:46:28.639 making the wrong decision which we
01:46:29.960 reassure them that is the right decision
01:46:32.119 and not knowing how to make a decision
01:46:34.320 so then we walk them through how to make
01:46:35.880 a logical decision what questions they
01:46:37.199 should ask and we just lead them through
01:46:38.400 it that's it and when I go through the
01:46:41.199 uh objections that my audience came up
01:46:43.520 with um whatever I respond with I'm not
01:46:46.199 saying say word for word I think
01:46:47.880 understanding the argument behind it is
01:46:49.719 what will help you close more deals in
01:46:51.599 that same vein you really only need to
01:46:54.280 have two to three closes per obstacle
01:46:56.800 that you really like all right and so
01:46:59.199 that's why I'm saying like you don't
01:47:00.239 have to memorize them but you would you
01:47:01.520 would want to know the two or three that
01:47:02.760 you're usually going to bring up when it
01:47:04.400 comes to uh a Time overcome or a money
01:47:07.119 overcome or a decisionmaker overcome or
01:47:08.679 a stall close uh or an avoidance thing
01:47:10.960 right all of those are you just want to
01:47:12.639 have two to three that you know like I
01:47:14.320 could give you a hundred but which one
01:47:16.679 you're going to use on a regular basis
01:47:17.840 it's going to depend on the ones that
01:47:18.800 you feel most comfortable saying in your
01:47:20.000 own language in the spirit of the
01:47:21.639 allpurpose closes
01:47:23.560 uh earlier I said when in doubt say it
01:47:26.000 back another thing is that if you ever
01:47:28.239 get lost in the details or you're just
01:47:29.880 like you're like where am I right now
01:47:31.880 lost question
01:47:34.280 zoom out all right so this is where you
01:47:37.800 say whoa whoa tot okay I feel like we've
01:47:40.320 got we've got all the way to Pluto uh
01:47:42.320 and back together so big picture right
01:47:44.800 this is how it you always phrase it like
01:47:46.280 big picture or let's zoom out for a
01:47:47.800 second this is where we say hey best
01:47:49.840 case worst case right this is an
01:47:51.400 allpurpose close so it's zoom out out
01:47:53.080 best case worst case best case we get
01:47:54.480 you this thing worst case you get six
01:47:56.480 weeks of free service from us and you
01:47:58.000 get your money back if you hate us all
01:48:00.440 right and so again getting best case
01:48:02.960 worst case closes um especially strong
01:48:06.719 if you have any kind of guarantee um
01:48:08.840 that's associated with whatever it is
01:48:10.000 that you sell hugely valuable mostly
01:48:12.719 just because best Cas worth Cas clothes
01:48:14.119 just murders because you can say listen
01:48:16.440 at the end of the day you have two
01:48:18.199 options both are risk-free you canot do
01:48:21.040 this go home and that's guarant aned to
01:48:23.400 get you in the exact same position
01:48:24.480 you're currently at or you can take a
01:48:26.440 shot here also risk-free but you've got
01:48:28.880 a chance of getting what you want so one
01:48:30.920 is guaranteed to not the other one's got
01:48:32.480 a chance both are risk-free which one
01:48:34.239 you want right best case worst case and
01:48:36.040 so guarantees help you boil the decision
01:48:38.080 down so low that it's just simple yes no
01:48:41.840 and so uh whenever you're lost zoom out
01:48:45.040 so finally you have reinforced the
01:48:48.280 decision so you're like wait a second
01:48:49.560 where is that coming from so the closer
01:48:52.520 frame has c l o s e r so everything I've
01:48:55.679 talked about has been e which is explain
01:48:57.440 away their concerns the last step of all
01:49:00.239 of these is that you want to reinforce
01:49:02.440 the decision all right and so when you
01:49:04.560 reinforce the decision it's actually
01:49:07.199 what happens after you've gotten the
01:49:08.599 money so you've explained explained away
01:49:10.199 their concerns they now buy and then
01:49:13.119 post swipe post purchase that's when you
01:49:17.119 do the handshake all right now I'm not
01:49:20.320 saying a physical handshake I'm saying
01:49:22.239 that you pass them off instead of a hand
01:49:24.239 off you do a handshake with customer
01:49:26.560 success so if you've ever seen you know
01:49:28.320 from this whole you know video so far
01:49:30.719 there's the through line that all
01:49:32.880 information should get passed like a
01:49:34.360 baton from the person to the next person
01:49:36.840 in line and so I like using this concept
01:49:40.239 of bamfam which is book a meeting from a
01:49:42.400 meeting and every interaction with a
01:49:45.320 customer they should know exactly when
01:49:47.119 the next time they're going to be
01:49:48.599 meeting and with whom and the with whom
01:49:51.159 person should know all of the
01:49:52.760 conversation they've had up to that
01:49:54.280 point so they know a lot about the
01:49:55.760 Prospect and what the salespeople have
01:49:57.880 said up to that point so that they know
01:49:59.520 the goals the aspirations the fears the
01:50:01.320 pains so that when they talk to them
01:50:02.800 they can talk in those terms and it will
01:50:04.800 be unbelievably more compelling now
01:50:06.440 we've we implemented this one of our
01:50:08.400 portfol companies I made a case study
01:50:09.599 about it just switching from a handoff
01:50:11.400 to a handshake handoff is like good luck
01:50:13.920 right and they pass him to the Cs team
01:50:15.440 and the Cs team is like oh I'm trying to
01:50:16.560 catch it right rather than John this is
01:50:19.000 Sarah Sarah's going to help you with
01:50:20.520 your XYZ problem so that you can
01:50:21.920 accomplish goal and she's going to walk
01:50:24.239 you through with the next steps look
01:50:25.360 like you know it's been a pleasure
01:50:26.800 talking to you she's going to take care
01:50:28.119 of you she's cured cancer six times and
01:50:30.040 someone said she walked on water once I
01:50:31.639 can't confirm it but she's amazing Sarah
01:50:33.520 gets on and says John we're gon she's
01:50:35.679 we're going to help you take care of
01:50:36.679 this thing and the way we're going to do
01:50:38.239 that is then lays out the proof promise
01:50:40.400 plan but specific and personalized to
01:50:44.159 the pains and the and the and the
01:50:46.079 aspirations of the Prospect and so we
01:50:49.560 want to reinforce the decision because
01:50:51.159 this video is about making more sales
01:50:52.679 and just about that is about keeping
01:50:54.480 more sales and so if you reinforce the
01:50:56.040 decision you'll get a lot fewer drop
01:50:58.400 offs back outs cold feet first 30-day
01:51:01.280 refunds things like that all right so
01:51:03.800 now let's get into FAQs from the
01:51:07.079 audience and so these are going to be
01:51:09.320 real examples of real objections that
01:51:12.800 you guys are getting that I'm going to
01:51:13.920 do my very best uh to help
01:51:16.800 overcome so the first one we got is a
01:51:19.239 cheap competitor so the good news for
01:51:20.840 you is that we have one that we
01:51:21.760 literally just call the cheap competitor
01:51:23.000 close so uh this one you can smash so
01:51:25.560 you just say hey um if ours was the same
01:51:28.679 as theirs which one would you do then
01:51:30.560 they're going to say well I would do
01:51:31.760 yours and you're like why and then
01:51:33.520 they'll say well you have this thing
01:51:34.760 that seems a little better you got this
01:51:36.000 thing my friend referred to you you're
01:51:37.599 like right that's why we're more so you
01:51:39.239 let them tell you all the things that
01:51:40.480 make you better rather than you telling
01:51:41.880 them what makes you better and then you
01:51:43.119 say yeah and the thing is is usually
01:51:44.599 when you say it like that most people
01:51:45.760 laugh like you're like right and that's
01:51:47.599 why we're like and that's why we're
01:51:48.800 we're more right because we're better
01:51:50.920 and you know it that's why you're here
01:51:52.880 also by the way that's usually a uh it's
01:51:54.560 usually a buying question so that's good
01:51:56.159 it means you're pretty close to the sale
01:51:57.840 so that's called the cheap comparison
01:51:58.880 close all right so the next one you guys
01:52:00.360 had was uh the ID close because I do
01:52:02.679 this in person so if you don't know what
01:52:04.000 the ID close is is that I prefer to
01:52:06.560 close sales rather than asking for form
01:52:08.440 of payment when I'm in person for asking
01:52:10.320 for their ID first the reason I do that
01:52:12.119 is because someone takes their wallet
01:52:13.360 out usually they put it on the table or
01:52:14.840 they take their purse out and they pull
01:52:16.280 out their wallet that has all their
01:52:17.400 cards in it and so when they do that a
01:52:19.639 lot of little things can't happen after
01:52:21.560 that point they can't say forgot their
01:52:24.360 uh wallet they can't say they forgot
01:52:26.119 their credit card at home because now
01:52:28.119 it's right in front of me right and
01:52:29.719 because I didn't ask for their payment
01:52:31.040 yet I asked for their ID and so we asked
01:52:32.679 for the ID and I also like to do this
01:52:35.159 because when I get it there's always a
01:52:36.800 little bit of chitchat that happens
01:52:38.040 there so I'm like oh you should see my
01:52:39.639 picture it's terrible oh so you're from
01:52:41.159 you know blah blah blah oh that's
01:52:42.400 amazing you know I got a friend who's
01:52:43.520 out there and you're filling out and
01:52:44.800 also make sure that you fill out all the
01:52:46.040 information correctly which one of the
01:52:48.679 one of the ways that you can lose a sale
01:52:49.840 is that you put the wrong payment
01:52:50.920 information in or you tie to the wrong
01:52:53.040 uh uh ZIP code and you're like oh by the
01:52:54.800 way this how you can lean into like the
01:52:56.280 ZIP code that you have for this is this
01:52:57.719 the same zip that you have for the form
01:52:59.360 payment you want to use right and at
01:53:01.840 that point then you say awesome you put
01:53:03.599 it between your fingers and you gesture
01:53:05.679 towards the wallet wherever it is on the
01:53:07.119 table say I'll trade you for whatever
01:53:08.360 one you want to use right and so it's
01:53:10.599 cute it's easy you trade like this but
01:53:12.280 it's clear your line of sight it's like
01:53:14.159 they can't say now this just eliminates
01:53:16.840 a lot of BS so that you don't have to oh
01:53:19.400 I forgot my it's like well I didn't ask
01:53:20.719 for that yet and so if you're on Zoom so
01:53:23.880 that's what this is about how do I do
01:53:25.400 that same close you just say awesome can
01:53:27.320 you put your ID next to the camera is to
01:53:29.440 make sure that we associate the right
01:53:30.920 account profile with the right payment
01:53:32.840 and this to make sure that you're you
01:53:34.159 listen nowadays we just try to be
01:53:36.040 careful we try to be PCI Compliant I
01:53:37.639 just made that up it doesn't matter the
01:53:38.719 point is like I asked you and like if
01:53:40.079 you're really not true you just say
01:53:41.079 that's how we've always done it they'll
01:53:42.440 be fine with it don't worry about it all
01:53:43.840 right the next one uh is just generic uh
01:53:46.480 decision maker which is I have to talk
01:53:48.760 to my spouse my dog my grandmother my
01:53:51.079 business partner my emotional partner
01:53:52.440 partner whatever right fundamentally
01:53:54.679 they're saying that they don't have the
01:53:55.679 authority to make the decision and so
01:53:58.520 first off if you know that whatever you
01:54:00.639 sell is something that will materially
01:54:02.320 affect a business or household then you
01:54:04.079 want to give the opportunity for them to
01:54:06.000 talk to their spouse in the setting
01:54:07.679 process right and so either it's uh you
01:54:10.400 either bring both of them on the call uh
01:54:12.520 if you're like selling B2B or you're
01:54:13.920 selling B Toc uh so especially like I
01:54:16.119 have a friend of mine who sells really
01:54:17.480 high ticket weight loss stuff they ask
01:54:19.440 the partner uh to get on the phone this
01:54:21.400 is specifically women and then they end
01:54:22.880 up just closing both Partners they're
01:54:24.360 like ah you know you should join to and
01:54:25.639 then they sell they make two sales out
01:54:26.880 of it they sell the husband and the wife
01:54:28.560 because you get better results when you
01:54:29.560 do together cool it turns the negative
01:54:31.440 into another sale opportunity if you're
01:54:33.639 in a business situation having the
01:54:35.000 business partners on the phone
01:54:36.000 beforehand helps now I also understand
01:54:39.079 that there are times when it's like
01:54:40.280 you've got one shot and this is your
01:54:42.000 this is your opportunity so I follow
01:54:44.079 process which is number one I say what
01:54:45.480 would happen if they said no and if I'm
01:54:47.040 talking to a more egotistical guy I
01:54:48.719 would say what happens if they don't
01:54:50.079 give you
01:54:50.960 permission because it makes them sound
01:54:53.040 like a uh and so by doing that
01:54:55.719 they're like oh I don't need permission
01:54:56.960 then you're like awesome let's get you
01:54:58.000 taken care of then right done over it
01:55:00.159 now this is very crazy but one out of
01:55:02.920 three times when you say what would
01:55:04.079 happen if they said no they're like I'd
01:55:06.040 do it anyways you're like so what are we
01:55:07.440 waiting for let's get started now the
01:55:08.639 two out of three times they'll say
01:55:10.119 something like well then I wouldn't do
01:55:11.360 it now some people say oh now that's
01:55:13.719 where that sale ends no we got tons
01:55:15.800 of questions left so you say oh well
01:55:17.679 what do you think would be their main
01:55:18.599 concern so now all I'm doing is just
01:55:20.400 shifting from okay okay you're not the
01:55:23.040 decision maker now let's talk to this
01:55:24.800 hypothetical person they've used their
01:55:27.639 partner as a foil the same way we use
01:55:30.800 this hypothetical person we talked to
01:55:32.040 earlier today as a foil for what they
01:55:33.719 want it works the same way it's just in
01:55:35.760 reverse and so you say so what's their
01:55:37.960 main concern even though they have no
01:55:39.400 idea and haven't been in the
01:55:40.360 conversation then what they're going to
01:55:41.800 do is they're going to tell you what
01:55:42.840 their main concern is through the mouth
01:55:44.400 of this hypothetical person they've made
01:55:45.920 as their business partner and then you
01:55:48.400 can actually follow through the same
01:55:49.760 well what would you think would make
01:55:50.599 them say no what do you think would make
01:55:51.960 an absolute yes for them what would it
01:55:53.560 take for us to move forward right and so
01:55:55.960 those are trying to isolate variables
01:55:57.679 and if you can offshoot there into
01:55:59.320 whatever that person says would be the
01:56:01.040 issue then you're out of the decision
01:56:02.800 maker frame and now you're closing the
01:56:05.119 obstacle now if they still say you know
01:56:08.040 they would be concerned with this or
01:56:09.679 that or whatever then I rotate into um
01:56:12.760 past agreements all right so past
01:56:14.599 agreements is like huh well do you think
01:56:17.119 uh like what would you think would be a
01:56:18.079 good indication that they would be okay
01:56:19.599 with it like from the stuff that you've
01:56:20.719 done already like do they know that
01:56:22.000 you're here do they know that like have
01:56:23.679 you bought things like this in the past
01:56:25.119 do they know that you're in pain with
01:56:26.239 the situation right now yes well if they
01:56:28.719 don't approve of your current situation
01:56:30.000 why would they not approve of you
01:56:30.960 solving something they already don't
01:56:32.040 approve of right so it's taking a
01:56:33.800 reversing a negative and so here it's
01:56:36.440 like sometimes you'll get they'll be
01:56:37.760 like you know you're right I think
01:56:38.639 that's fine if you still can't close
01:56:41.040 then you resort to support not
01:56:42.960 permission right and that's kind of like
01:56:44.400 the final kind of final straw but I try
01:56:46.679 and offshoot I really focus a lot on
01:56:48.719 that trying to break the foil and say
01:56:51.119 what do you think their main concern is
01:56:52.400 make it a no for them because now we're
01:56:54.000 isolating issues and we can tackle them
01:56:55.719 rather than getting around decision
01:56:57.440 maker but if they insist on decision
01:56:59.560 maker and you insist on having to close
01:57:01.440 the sale right now then you go to hey I
01:57:04.400 think that you're asking for permission
01:57:06.199 when you really should be looking for
01:57:07.320 support right because at the end of the
01:57:09.119 day if we play this out let's say your
01:57:10.920 business doesn't grow uh like who are
01:57:13.079 you going to blame is it fair to the
01:57:14.520 partnership that you don't get this
01:57:16.480 outcome because you rely on this person
01:57:18.679 person no right because all this is
01:57:20.800 going to do is that if you to not get
01:57:22.800 this person's
01:57:23.840 permission 5 years down the road where
01:57:25.800 you going to be right and who you going
01:57:28.040 to blame because fundamentally if
01:57:30.360 they're the one who are in charge then
01:57:32.280 they're the ones who also get all the
01:57:33.400 blame which means that you're not in any
01:57:34.760 way control of your own life and I don't
01:57:36.800 think that's fair to you I don't think
01:57:37.679 it's fair to them I don't think it's for
01:57:38.560 the
01:57:39.360 relationship and so that's the support
01:57:41.719 not permission angle and so that gives
01:57:43.920 you a lot of offshoots to uh close prior
01:57:47.760 to getting to that the decision maker is
01:57:49.800 the hardest one to overcome of all cloes
01:57:52.360 is because it's the only one that the
01:57:54.040 person says I can't make a decision so
01:57:55.599 doesn't matter what you say I have no
01:57:57.040 Authority and so the whole point like
01:57:59.159 the reasoning behind this is you see if
01:58:03.520 they actually do have authority and
01:58:04.880 they're just using it as a smoke screen
01:58:06.280 that's like the one out of three right
01:58:07.480 off the bat they say why I would do it
01:58:09.079 anyways that's a smoke screen done you
01:58:10.400 already closed the deal if they're using
01:58:12.320 it because they don't want to say what
01:58:14.040 their actually what their real objection
01:58:15.440 is then they're using this person to
01:58:17.239 tell you a hard truth because they're
01:58:18.880 afraid of insulting you because you know
01:58:20.760 it goes both ways and so then you say oh
01:58:22.960 well what would the you know what do you
01:58:24.440 think they would be afraid of having
01:58:25.840 happen What like um what would make them
01:58:28.159 say no and then you can overcome that
01:58:29.520 because it actually wasn't really that
01:58:31.000 they don't have decision-making
01:58:31.960 Authority they just didn't want to say
01:58:33.400 this thing but if they truly don't have
01:58:35.760 decision-making Authority trying to then
01:58:38.159 relate the fact that it's like oh you
01:58:40.920 might not have authority but they have
01:58:42.400 already agreed with you based on their
01:58:44.599 past agreements and so if you think
01:58:46.199 about each of these as arguments number
01:58:47.560 one is you do you actually have
01:58:49.719 authority and don't care uh
01:58:52.560 two is you were afraid to tell me and
01:58:54.159 have authority the third is you don't
01:58:56.079 have authority but they already have
01:58:58.719 agreed based on what they've already
01:59:00.199 done and then the fourth is basically
01:59:02.239 trying to get them to take authority of
01:59:03.920 their own lives by asking for support
01:59:06.159 not permission so that's the reasoning
01:59:07.880 behind kind of that four-step close with
01:59:10.159 that has offshoots all the way through
01:59:11.840 but if someone's like I absolutely need
01:59:14.239 must that's why we try to no matter what
01:59:17.280 if we know that this is a common thing
01:59:18.719 or it's an expensive you know if you're
01:59:20.079 trying to sell houses you're not going
01:59:21.920 to close the close the spouse and buying
01:59:24.320 the house without the other spouse it's
01:59:25.639 not going to happen right and so if you
01:59:27.239 know that both people are going to be
01:59:28.400 required for whatever it is that you
01:59:29.480 sell just involve them in the process
01:59:31.119 earlier so let's say someone says hey
01:59:33.360 everything sounds amazing uh give me
01:59:35.440 some time so it's actually there's like
01:59:37.760 there's a false truth in there that's
01:59:39.719 embedded which is it's actually not good
01:59:41.760 enough here's why so if someone says hey
01:59:44.719 you know this sounds amazing let me
01:59:46.079 Circle back in a couple quarters you say
01:59:48.320 awesome so what are you going to be
01:59:49.119 doing
01:59:49.960 instead and so then they're going to say
01:59:52.040 X Y and Z and then you're like okay um
01:59:54.480 zooming out and hey if you don't this is
01:59:56.520 just a question I asked somebody earlier
01:59:57.800 today and they it they said it was
01:59:59.239 enlightening so you mind if I share it
02:00:00.360 with you right because I'm already
02:00:01.199 getting into hard territory here right
02:00:03.360 so U at that point I'd say do you think
02:00:06.000 that doing what this is is going to get
02:00:07.679 you better returns than what we're
02:00:09.480 talking about right because again time
02:00:11.960 is priorities so all like fundamentally
02:00:14.800 like I said earlier like you have to
02:00:15.880 understand the theory behind this
02:00:16.760 they're saying I have other things that
02:00:18.360 are more important and so we have to say
02:00:20.880 no this is more important which means we
02:00:23.119 have to elevate the value of what we're
02:00:24.520 currently doing or devalue what they're
02:00:26.960 currently doing so fundamentally that's
02:00:30.320 the that's how we're attacking this so
02:00:32.000 it's like what are you going to do
02:00:32.800 instead got it do you think it'll make
02:00:34.239 you more than this and if they say yes
02:00:37.000 then you'd say why if they say no then
02:00:39.199 it's like oh then you should prioritize
02:00:40.360 this let's get rolling right and so with
02:00:42.040 each of these you'll not there's like
02:00:43.239 there's offshoots like if if they say
02:00:44.920 yes then it's done you've already closed
02:00:46.040 it right if they say uh no I think this
02:00:48.880 other thing would make me more money and
02:00:50.520 the thing is is if there right then they
02:00:53.679 should do
02:00:54.840 that and so a big part of being an
02:00:57.480 ethical salesman is that the moment that
02:01:00.560 you feel like a prospect is better
02:01:02.679 served not doing something you should
02:01:06.360 stop but this is why you want to sell
02:01:09.320 stuff that works better right uh but if
02:01:12.880 you do have something that you know will
02:01:14.000 make the more money then all you have to
02:01:15.199 do is break down how it's going to make
02:01:16.639 them more money and then cover cost of
02:01:19.119 in action so that would be okay so uh
02:01:22.440 let's put math to it and that's how I'd
02:01:23.880 say like let's put some math let's let's
02:01:25.239 put some numbers down so if we improve
02:01:27.079 your conversion rate you know by 30%
02:01:29.599 that would increase Revenue by 30% but
02:01:31.480 you have uh you know gross margins of 90
02:01:34.599 and so and your and your current net
02:01:35.960 margins are 30 and so if we do that
02:01:38.679 we'll actually double the profit of the
02:01:40.360 business so the things that you're
02:01:41.560 working on right now um are those
02:01:44.719 doubling the profit of the business and
02:01:46.840 over what time period over two quarters
02:01:49.199 well if we could double the profit of
02:01:50.480 the business would that allow you to
02:01:51.360 make those things happen even faster
02:01:53.520 okay just asking so I can understand
02:01:55.119 right and so again when you're getting
02:01:56.760 into those situations it's always the
02:01:58.119 seek to understand frame right that's
02:01:59.920 the that's where we're coming from and
02:02:01.599 so if you have elevated yourself to a
02:02:04.360 helpful guide then it shouldn't feel
02:02:06.040 combative it's like totally get it just
02:02:08.520 so I'm clear you're saying that because
02:02:10.960 the stuff that you're going to do is
02:02:11.920 make you more money than what we're
02:02:13.760 talking about and if they're like no
02:02:15.480 then it's like oh then why are you
02:02:17.599 prioritizing
02:02:19.320 it right and the thing is a lot of times
02:02:21.360 whenever someone gives you an answer you
02:02:22.360 can always ask why because then you can
02:02:24.079 go chunk up to reason and then basically
02:02:26.079 say oh my thing actually solves that
02:02:27.480 reason even better so uh I'm really busy
02:02:31.239 right now is different from the give me
02:02:33.440 some time and it sounds similar but
02:02:35.639 they're actually different uh different
02:02:37.320 objections right which is I don't have
02:02:39.320 time I'm busy right now whatever all
02:02:41.719 right so this one is give me some time
02:02:43.719 to make the decision like let me decide
02:02:45.719 in a week that's when you go that's
02:02:47.920 avoidance that's decision avoidance if
02:02:49.719 someone says I don't have time and I
02:02:52.040 could do this later that's the I'm busy
02:02:54.239 which means that we're we're talking
02:02:55.599 about priorities what else are you doing
02:02:57.199 that's more important than this so let's
02:02:58.560 say that you don't have a guarantee
02:03:00.239 which is fine I don't have a guarantee
02:03:01.480 around most of the things that I sawell
02:03:02.920 all right um the anti-g guarantee is how
02:03:06.960 I like to sell around guarantee which is
02:03:09.159 oh if you're the type of person who
02:03:10.880 needs a guarantee then this is
02:03:12.400 definitely not for you because at the
02:03:14.679 end of the day we can control we can
02:03:16.840 control we can't control what you do so
02:03:18.280 do you think it'd be fair for us to
02:03:20.679 guarantee work I have no input in doing
02:03:23.920 and so it really just comes down to
02:03:25.639 basically the more control you have the
02:03:27.239 more you can offer a guarantee the less
02:03:28.880 control you have the less you can offer
02:03:30.639 a guarantee if you choose not to offer
02:03:32.400 them and so you want to basically do a
02:03:34.400 takeaway sale on the guarantee being
02:03:37.320 like oh this is really for people who
02:03:39.040 are serious about doing it are you
02:03:41.639 serious about doing it okay cool I can't
02:03:44.159 control I can't eat the food for you I
02:03:45.800 can't work out for you I can give you
02:03:47.920 the guide and I can tell you that
02:03:48.760 hundreds of other people have S
02:03:50.040 succeeded but I can't do it for you
02:03:52.760 myself it's one of the few things that I
02:03:54.079 can't do right does that sound
02:03:55.840 reasonable right and that's and that's
02:03:57.400 where like reasonable is what we're
02:03:59.280 going with is that sound fair so that
02:04:00.800 makes sense uh around an anti-g
02:04:03.320 guarantee for uh for not having a
02:04:06.239 guarantee if they off if they say you
02:04:07.360 don't have one all right so the next one
02:04:08.840 that came from the audience was uh hey
02:04:10.520 let me watch some of your free stuff or
02:04:12.119 let me go through your lead magnet right
02:04:13.599 so like if you've got some sort of
02:04:15.159 resources that you put out there and
02:04:16.920 then they get on the sales call and say
02:04:18.079 oh well you know or this sales call was
02:04:19.360 super helpful I think I'm just going to
02:04:20.880 you know do the stuff that you said on
02:04:22.119 the sales call what you do is you agree
02:04:24.360 with them and say oh absolutely you
02:04:25.960 should do that uh and do that before you
02:04:28.239 come out or before you start our program
02:04:30.559 or before you whatever before we start
02:04:32.599 and kick you off so you just say you
02:04:34.559 should totally do that because if you do
02:04:36.520 that successfully then one of two things
02:04:38.960 is going to happen either you're going
02:04:40.800 to succeed in which case you're going to
02:04:42.880 run into another problem that I can help
02:04:44.040 you solve or you're not going to succeed
02:04:45.960 in which case I can help you solve it to
02:04:47.679 begin with but either way you should you
02:04:49.800 should get started so let's get you
02:04:50.960 moving and so again we have to take it
02:04:53.639 from I want to do this thing we agree
02:04:55.559 with them we're not disagreeing you
02:04:56.800 should totally do that stuff because it
02:04:58.239 will make you money and one of two
02:05:00.679 things are going to happen you're going
02:05:02.079 to succeed in which case you're going to
02:05:03.119 run into another issue which we can help
02:05:04.480 you solve
02:05:05.840 or you're not going to succeed in which
02:05:08.079 case we can help you solve
02:05:11.159 that either way results in you doing it
02:05:13.400 so let's get started if you sell to the
02:05:15.520 government or you have very large
02:05:16.960 Enterprises that require 6 12 month
02:05:19.000 sales cycles and you need multiple
02:05:20.480 stakeholders uh to buy in much of the
02:05:24.040 stuff that I covered here is not going
02:05:26.400 to apply and that's because these are
02:05:28.639 these are transactional these are
02:05:30.360 basically these fundamentally all of
02:05:32.360 these force a prospect to make a
02:05:34.000 decision now in a big Fortune 100 or a
02:05:37.440 government sale things like that
02:05:38.719 oftentimes no one has the ability to
02:05:41.320 make a decision and it's a decision by
02:05:42.679 committee and so you basically need to
02:05:44.760 continue to stay in the pocket and in
02:05:47.000 most Enterprise sales the amount of
02:05:49.760 people that the customer talks to in
02:05:52.239 your organization increases the
02:05:53.599 likelihood of closing and a smooth uh
02:05:56.400 transition and so if they talk to two or
02:05:59.040 three people on your team and you talk
02:06:00.559 to two or three people on their team
02:06:02.159 it's like uh I'll give you a
02:06:05.480 visual so if it's you and one person
02:06:09.559 this Bond easily broken but if it's
02:06:13.040 you and three people on their team and
02:06:15.760 two people on
02:06:17.440 yours then you
02:06:20.400 have uh uh whatever I could draw all
02:06:22.679 these connections but you get the you
02:06:23.840 get the you get the point there you go
02:06:25.239 so there's way more ties and this is
02:06:27.840 much harder to break and so with
02:06:29.719 Enterprise sales it looks more like this
02:06:31.320 than it does like this so hopefully feel
02:06:33.320 like I helped you guys overcome some of
02:06:34.840 the obstacles that you brought up
02:06:35.880 otherwise we could be here all day now
02:06:37.199 that we forget out closing we just got
02:06:38.880 to make sure that our heads space is
02:06:40.520 right and we continue to do the right
02:06:42.320 things over and over again so wrap up
02:06:44.360 with mindset now I hate the term mindset
02:06:47.280 overall because I'm like what does that
02:06:48.440 even mean and so what I'm going to try
02:06:50.079 and do is reframe some set things that I
02:06:52.119 have into behaviors that they apply to
02:06:54.920 all right so sales mindset number one
02:06:57.159 the person who cares the most about the
02:06:58.960 prospect wins the sale and so if they
02:07:02.400 care more about themselves than you care
02:07:04.440 about them they will win and so in terms
02:07:07.679 of what does this change about your
02:07:09.040 behavior the idea is that if you truly
02:07:11.679 care about them you will usually not
02:07:14.040 lose Rapport in the sale because you
02:07:15.639 will always seek to understand and so
02:07:18.000 then you will always your tone will
02:07:19.840 change your conviction will change
02:07:21.280 because because fundamentally it says
02:07:23.440 keep the human first if this is no
02:07:26.400 longer a good idea for them you should
02:07:28.040 not sell them you should tell them I
02:07:30.320 think it's a good idea for you not to do
02:07:31.800 this and I promise you there's nothing
02:07:34.320 more powerful than learning to turn away
02:07:36.239 prospects which will increase your
02:07:37.520 overall closing percentage because you
02:07:39.119 will know that you are in this to help
02:07:41.520 people make decisions to help themselves
02:07:43.480 and so if you try to close everybody you
02:07:45.199 will it will start to wear on you over
02:07:46.960 time because you'll know that you're a
02:07:48.599 piece of all right and so either
02:07:50.599 you're you become a sociopath or you
02:07:52.760 your sales will go down so instead make
02:07:55.719 sure you qualify prospects Never Lie um
02:07:58.880 and if you keep the person at the center
02:08:00.480 of the sale then when someone says I got
02:08:02.520 to think about it you're
02:08:04.320 like Sarah I'm trying to figure out how
02:08:06.480 to make this work for you because I know
02:08:08.239 this is going to help you and I I want
02:08:10.639 to help you make this decision because I
02:08:12.800 I just genuinely believe that so what
02:08:15.239 are the what's what are you most afraid
02:08:16.599 of right now like what are you what are
02:08:19.079 you afraid of having happen right and
02:08:21.559 then you get to the heart of it and the
02:08:22.480 thing is is if you keep that Rapport you
02:08:24.760 will close more sales because they will
02:08:26.199 feel that you do care so the next one
02:08:28.239 comes from uh my team so this is one
02:08:30.119 that I repeat over and over and over
02:08:31.239 again so this is banged into their
02:08:32.440 skulls uh volume negates luck all right
02:08:38.360 and so the big thing uh with sales is
02:08:41.119 that it is a num game it's like dating
02:08:44.320 you just have to know what the pipeline
02:08:46.719 is and the guys who become the best
02:08:49.119 salespeople are the ones who do the most
02:08:51.159 volume volume and so there's this
02:08:52.840 relationship between volume and skill
02:08:54.920 the more you do the better you get the
02:08:56.400 better you get the more you do and so
02:08:58.599 the idea is that you want to in the
02:09:00.599 beginning force feed yourself through
02:09:02.559 tons and tons of volumes so that you can
02:09:04.639 get through the terrible period as fast
02:09:06.719 as possible because a master in any
02:09:09.159 domain has more ways to reward
02:09:11.320 themselves if you're a master editor
02:09:13.520 then when you look at a video there's a
02:09:14.800 hundred things that you can do that you
02:09:15.840 know how to do that you enjoy doing that
02:09:17.840 you've been rewarded in the past for
02:09:19.280 doing if you're a Salesman who's a
02:09:21.079 master salesman you can you like pulling
02:09:24.199 a sale out of the depths you love
02:09:26.440 overcoming the details you enjoy being
02:09:28.239 in the red zone and kind of navigating
02:09:30.320 those conversations because it's a fun
02:09:31.520 challenge for you when you're a beginner
02:09:33.440 you're freaked out and you're paranoid
02:09:34.760 you don't know what you're doing and so
02:09:36.599 the idea is to you to follow what Kobe
02:09:38.480 Bryant did so if everybody else is
02:09:40.480 working out once a day if I work out
02:09:42.239 three times a day I'm going to get
02:09:43.520 better that much faster and so my
02:09:45.400 recommendation is find the person on
02:09:47.760 your team who's the best closer and do
02:09:51.599 double the effort that they're doing and
02:09:53.400 if you're like dude that's barely even
02:09:54.960 possible great welcome to getting better
02:09:58.239 right and the thing is is that I'll I'll
02:10:00.119 draw this this visual that uh that we we
02:10:03.199 introduce a lot of our our sales team
02:10:05.000 with which is this is what your skill is
02:10:08.840 going to look like over
02:10:10.559 time so this is this might take you know
02:10:13.159 two to three months and this might take
02:10:16.280 you know a year and this might take you
02:10:19.480 know two to three years
02:10:21.840 for your skill so this is my skill here
02:10:24.320 we go but what people don't understand
02:10:28.440 is that this is your
02:10:31.880 income and so in the beginning you just
02:10:34.239 learn not to suck which is fantastic and
02:10:36.480 very important to suck less but
02:10:38.280 eventually you'll suck so little that
02:10:39.599 you'll actually be very good and all of
02:10:41.960 the best returns in life come at the
02:10:44.599 very end of Mastery and so people give
02:10:47.320 up in this period of
02:10:48.960 time but they miss out this much where
02:10:52.159 all of the gains are going to happen
02:10:53.599 because they quit early and so you have
02:10:55.880 to approach sales as a skill and if you
02:10:59.000 hate it just understand it's not that
02:11:01.400 you hate it because you somehow have
02:11:03.320 some natural distaste for
02:11:06.280 sales you just aren't skilled enough
02:11:08.719 because I promise the best salespeople
02:11:11.280 love selling the best editors love
02:11:14.079 editing the best writers love writing
02:11:16.920 and when the best editor started editing
02:11:19.000 they sucked at editing and the best
02:11:20.679 sales people started sales they sucked
02:11:22.599 at sales I didn't close my first sale
02:11:24.679 all right I'm just saying like but I had
02:11:26.880 enough reward cycles and I forced enough
02:11:28.400 volume down my throat that I started
02:11:29.599 liking it and then once you like it that
02:11:32.040 reward Cycle takes over all right the
02:11:33.920 next one is sales resumés don't matter
02:11:37.440 and I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm GNA explain
02:11:39.000 what I mean by this so I have had two
02:11:41.719 times in my career where our sales teams
02:11:43.599 were not growing at the rate that they
02:11:44.840 needed to to support the amount of
02:11:46.360 demand that was coming in and that was
02:11:48.079 very frustrating for me and once I dove
02:11:50.239 in I wrote a chapter about this in uh my
02:11:52.599 leads book on the uh employees chapter
02:11:55.760 um once I dove in I found out that in
02:11:57.880 both situations they were screening
02:11:59.599 heavily the salespeople's resumee to
02:12:01.880 qualify them to get interviewed and that
02:12:04.320 is typically in my opinion a mistake
02:12:06.440 because especially in a transactional
02:12:07.920 selling environment so if you're
02:12:08.840 thinking setting or one to two call
02:12:10.239 closing so very short sales Cycles
02:12:12.000 you're going to immediately look for
02:12:13.920 other skills outside of what their past
02:12:16.840 experience is that you can tell very
02:12:18.719 quickly on a call and so I am more
02:12:22.599 Pro Group interviews and so you can just
02:12:26.719 invite everyone onto the call and
02:12:30.159 quickly do one to two minute interviews
02:12:32.800 with everyone who hops on because the
02:12:34.840 star salespeople will in that
02:12:37.199 environment where they need to speak up
02:12:38.639 be more assertive be more social uh one
02:12:41.520 they'll speak up two they'll be clear
02:12:43.119 communicators three the really good ones
02:12:45.520 uh will also encourage other people who
02:12:47.079 are nervous so that's just something
02:12:48.520 that we've noticed there they're going
02:12:49.639 to be more team players at least the
02:12:51.719 type of salesp people that we want to
02:12:52.880 attract and so group interviews instead
02:12:56.159 of resume screening as one of the
02:12:59.159 easiest ways to scale a sales team that
02:13:01.079 we've found now one of the things that
02:13:03.840 people don't understand about this is
02:13:05.960 the understanding between
02:13:08.639 attitude and aptitude all right so
02:13:11.119 you've probably heard the like hi for
02:13:12.480 attitude uh not for aptitude all right
02:13:16.320 so that is true sort of and so let me
02:13:20.000 explain so so fundamentally the real
02:13:22.719 truth is you should always hire for the
02:13:24.840 lowest skill deficiency so it's just
02:13:28.400 what are the deficient skills what is
02:13:30.119 the cost of training these skills I want
02:13:31.800 to hire people who have the lowest
02:13:33.559 efficiency which means that I have the
02:13:35.119 fastest ramp up or the highest return on
02:13:37.280 investment for them becoming proficient
02:13:39.040 in the business that's fundamentally
02:13:40.360 what all hiring is in general not just
02:13:42.440 sales and so the thing is is that we
02:13:45.119 have these bundled terms like kind
02:13:49.159 hardworking right uh
02:13:52.040 uh uh charismatic whatever right but the
02:13:55.960 thing is is that these are bundled terms
02:13:57.520 that actually have many skills
02:13:58.679 underneath of them and so when we say
02:14:00.599 hire for attitude it really means you
02:14:02.360 know there's probably 20 different
02:14:03.920 examples of what kindness looks like
02:14:05.679 within the setting of a workplace and if
02:14:07.800 someone has zero of them that's 20
02:14:09.480 skills I have to teach them whereas if
02:14:11.719 they only need to learn how to call
02:14:13.199 leads and work leads and say a script
02:14:15.679 that might only be two to three weeks of
02:14:17.599 training but training someone to be kind
02:14:19.440 certainly takes longer than two to three
02:14:20.840 weeks
02:14:21.960 now where this flips is that there is
02:14:24.440 some point in the future where if you
02:14:26.679 have a very Niche expertise that's very
02:14:28.719 very hard to find it might be easier to
02:14:31.400 teach you to be kind than to teach you
02:14:33.400 how to code like a level 10 expert or to
02:14:36.440 be a transactional CFO that's done you
02:14:38.440 know 50 transactions before for your
02:14:40.480 type of Industry there might not be that
02:14:41.960 many people who've done that and so it
02:14:43.280 might be easier to teach them how to
02:14:45.320 behave within your culture than it is to
02:14:47.320 teach them that skill set and so this is
02:14:49.639 more true the lower level the role that
02:14:53.280 you're hiring for and less true as you
02:14:54.960 get higher but the fundamental universal
02:14:57.719 truth is that you always hire for the
02:14:59.440 small skill deficiency so the next is
02:15:01.920 that compensation attracts great
02:15:05.079 salespeople but it does not retain them
02:15:07.520 or get them to behave the way you want
02:15:10.760 to so
02:15:12.800 compensation equals
02:15:16.800 recruiting compensation in my experience
02:15:19.840 does not equal uh performance and I'm
02:15:23.159 now you might be like of course it does
02:15:25.239 I'm just telling you uh in my experience
02:15:27.719 I have never had a compensation change
02:15:30.360 really change the behavior of the team
02:15:32.679 except for one thing uh which I will
02:15:35.040 share with you if you compensate them
02:15:37.400 off of cash collected you will in
02:15:39.360 general get more cash collected but
02:15:42.000 everything else in terms of like we're
02:15:43.159 going to pay this for that and this for
02:15:44.480 that most of the times the reward cycle
02:15:46.520 is so delayed they're just going to
02:15:48.360 still just try as hard as they can to
02:15:50.239 sell and so the things that change
02:15:53.159 Behavior are typically much faster uh
02:15:56.159 and lower intensity meaning you were
02:15:58.480 addicted to your phone not because it
02:15:59.840 pays you but because it has a very fast
02:16:01.360 feedback loop and so the reason that in
02:16:05.599 general sales in Slack are
02:16:08.760 overrepresented from sales that actually
02:16:10.520 get processed is because people get
02:16:12.320 rewarded for saying I closed the deal in
02:16:15.079 slack and so they say they close deals
02:16:17.239 more times than they do and so you by
02:16:20.599 the way Pro tip on that is just create a
02:16:22.800 zap between your uh CRM and a process
02:16:25.840 sale that's been submitted and make that
02:16:27.880 the thing that goes into slack that they
02:16:29.320 get kudos on just a side little little
02:16:31.520 tip ski there for you um but it's been
02:16:35.280 my experience that you absolutely get
02:16:36.679 better closers with higher comp but and
02:16:39.398 when I say better closers I mean people
02:16:40.599 who have smaller skill deficiencies that
02:16:42.318 you need to train but then after that
02:16:45.599 trying to like redo compensation over
02:16:48.200 and over again it's very rare in my
02:16:50.240 experience that it has has changed the
02:16:51.718 behavior of the team that in a way that
02:16:53.879 training and fast feedback loops can't
02:16:56.359 do better the next is that sales and
02:16:58.920 marketing are one Continuum all right so
02:17:01.200 people see them as different departments
02:17:03.519 and for me I've actually profited a lot
02:17:07.599 um by putting them Under One Roof so I
02:17:11.920 always have our meetings as basically
02:17:14.120 Revenue generation uh and you can have a
02:17:16.318 chief Revenue officer who really
02:17:17.799 oversees acquisition overall and
02:17:21.439 since I've done this and I've done this
02:17:22.679 for years um there's basically been no
02:17:25.120 conflict between sales and marketing
02:17:26.558 they're working together to close as
02:17:27.638 many deals as possible so if you ever
02:17:29.318 have conflict where like sales is like
02:17:31.200 marketing they G they're not giving us
02:17:33.280 enough leads or the leads are and
02:17:34.840 then s uh and then marketing's telling
02:17:36.318 sales like why don't you close anything
02:17:37.760 like you should be closing right like
02:17:39.200 it's because they're sitting on opposite
02:17:40.240 side of the table but when they're
02:17:41.679 collaborating under the same roof
02:17:43.359 especially if there's one leader ahead
02:17:44.638 of it all of that disappears like I
02:17:46.599 can't remember the last time that like
02:17:48.120 Marketing sales had any kind of like
02:17:49.359 weird weirdness in companies that I own
02:17:52.638 uh and so you have you do that by
02:17:54.080 unifying them and I explain it like this
02:17:56.679 which is that they sit on one Continuum
02:17:59.080 and so fundamentally you just have a
02:18:00.879 certain amount of information that's
02:18:03.240 required to get someone to buy and so in
02:18:07.000 a hypothetical world if someone was
02:18:08.679 perfectly knowledgeable they could make
02:18:10.558 the buying decision on their own and
02:18:12.280 companies have proven that like carvana
02:18:14.160 that doesn't have salespeople or Tesla
02:18:16.599 which you can buy a car on the website
02:18:19.080 like if you have enough marketing people
02:18:21.240 can get and search for enough
02:18:22.760 information that they just make a buying
02:18:24.040 decision on their own but whenever you
02:18:26.040 have sufficient marketing to get people
02:18:27.478 to start buying on their own there's
02:18:30.000 typically an even larger pool of people
02:18:32.398 who do need more selling to occur to
02:18:36.318 close this Gap to get them to buy and so
02:18:38.920 sales think about sales as personalized
02:18:41.040 marketing which is okay you uh let's say
02:18:44.120 that there's uh one two three four uh
02:18:48.200 five six things that someone needs to
02:18:50.040 know in order to buy if marketing covers
02:18:53.240 1 two and three then you the salesperson
02:18:56.679 cover four five and six now let's say
02:18:58.840 the next Prospect comes in and they have
02:19:00.760 one three and five then you would cover
02:19:03.760 two four and six and so basically it
02:19:06.000 allows you to personalize the
02:19:07.638 information required to get this person
02:19:09.040 to make a decision I don't believe in
02:19:10.760 any kind of mysticism around like oh
02:19:12.599 over this price you have to sell over
02:19:14.478 the phone I do think that there are
02:19:16.519 behaviors in general that more people do
02:19:19.240 but I don't think it's in any way a
02:19:21.799 necessity but a lot of times there are
02:19:24.439 opportunities because there's just more
02:19:25.840 people who don't know as much as people
02:19:27.359 who buy so having a sales team will
02:19:29.439 almost always improve the overall Roi or
02:19:32.080 roaz uh asend for any kind of
02:19:34.558 acquisition process another good thing
02:19:36.760 to understand from a mindset perspective
02:19:38.718 is the difference between uh like belief
02:19:41.799 and Trust not really the difference but
02:19:43.280 belief and Trust actually exist because
02:19:46.840 people talk about like oh you need to
02:19:48.120 have trust from the prospect it's not
02:19:50.720 they have to trust you because they are
02:19:53.040 actually continuums it's how much do
02:19:56.479 they trust you how much do they believe
02:19:59.040 you and so when you think about it this
02:20:00.960 way then it's not this binary of like oh
02:20:03.280 they didn't trust you it's they didn't
02:20:04.479 trust you enough which then allows us to
02:20:07.000 have these little check marks along the
02:20:09.160 way that we can say these things
02:20:10.960 increase the belief of the prospect
02:20:13.560 these things increase the trust of the
02:20:15.720 prospect these things decrease the trust
02:20:17.680 of the Prospect and the more things you
02:20:18.960 do that get them to believe you and
02:20:20.040 trust you the more likely it is that
02:20:21.920 they will buy and so fundamentally
02:20:23.920 seeing sales in these two frames allows
02:20:26.040 you to think of sales as an education
02:20:27.840 process which you then teach them in
02:20:30.800 order to change their behavior and so
02:20:32.280 one of my one of my little isms that I
02:20:34.080 like to think of is that in general the
02:20:37.120 trust and belief that is required to
02:20:38.720 make a big purchase is smaller than the
02:20:40.560 trust and belief that is required to
02:20:41.800 make a little purchase and so basically
02:20:44.720 the bigger the plane so if I have a
02:20:46.040 little plane right that's a bad plane
02:20:48.760 there we go if I have a little plane
02:20:50.880 then I don't need a very long Runway to
02:20:52.520 get this plane to take off if I have a
02:20:55.319 big
02:20:58.200 plane then I'm going to need a very long
02:21:01.439 takeoff to get this to go up and so if
02:21:04.520 you're selling a more expensive thing
02:21:06.240 think about it like it's a bigger plane
02:21:07.920 which means you're going to have more
02:21:08.920 selling more information that's going to
02:21:11.160 have to happen before they make a
02:21:12.680 purchasing decision and so if you're
02:21:14.240 getting a lot of two three four call
02:21:15.880 closes it's usually because you're not
02:21:17.560 doing enough education prior to the
02:21:19.200 first call so the thing that change is
02:21:21.200 you need to create more education
02:21:22.880 materials basically you need to
02:21:24.240 pre-market them more you need to warm
02:21:26.600 them up which is just move them along
02:21:28.439 this Continuum here you need to move
02:21:30.240 them along the Continuum more so your
02:21:31.479 sales don't have to take three four five
02:21:33.479 calls but instead they get them to the 6
02:21:35.760 inch Putt and they can putt them in they
02:21:37.840 get them to the 5 yard line and they can
02:21:39.359 knock it forward the next one is what
02:21:41.760 I'll call say less and so this is uh
02:21:44.640 something that one of one of uh our
02:21:46.120 sales guys said that I said to them
02:21:47.720 apparently um and and really help them
02:21:50.960 out a lot in terms of changing their
02:21:52.319 behavior and so if you tend to be more
02:21:55.120 talkative in terms of talk time you want
02:21:56.840 to have roughly two-thirds of the talk
02:21:59.040 time from the prospect not you now gong
02:22:02.160 uh and some of these other sales tools
02:22:03.720 have released different like ideal
02:22:05.479 closing amounts but in general most
02:22:07.680 closers talk less than the Prospect and
02:22:09.880 so that's because they're asking they're
02:22:11.280 answering your questions you're not
02:22:12.479 answering theirs ideally and so one of
02:22:15.560 the things that I noticed with the most
02:22:16.720 compelling conversations uh that I've
02:22:18.840 had and the podcast that I've been on is
02:22:20.120 the m Master interviewers uh so uh
02:22:22.960 Steven Bartlett when I was on Dio and
02:22:25.600 Williamson the few times have been on on
02:22:27.280 his pod they're very good at letting
02:22:29.479 silence
02:22:30.640 sit and people like to talk about
02:22:33.640 themselves and people will expound on
02:22:35.680 themselves if you do not respond so I
02:22:37.840 would encourage you to try this so
02:22:39.160 remember I'm changing this in terms of
02:22:40.520 what does it change about Behavior if
02:22:42.280 someone says something instead of
02:22:43.640 immediately jabbing back sometimes just
02:22:46.720 let them talk more just give them more
02:22:49.120 time to talk because the more they talk
02:22:51.920 the more Rapport you have because people
02:22:53.720 like talking about themselves so they'll
02:22:55.000 think that you're amazing without you
02:22:56.280 ever saying anything all right the next
02:22:58.040 one is a story that I got told to me by
02:23:00.000 a Serial CEO seial private Equity CEO so
02:23:02.520 when I was uh when I was interviewing
02:23:04.359 CEOs of the companies that um had been
02:23:07.920 sold or been acquired by the private
02:23:10.040 Equity firms that we were we were
02:23:11.800 recording at the time they introduced me
02:23:13.240 some CEOs and actually was one of the
02:23:14.479 most valuable things I got uh from the
02:23:16.399 whole process outside of the the
02:23:17.840 transaction so one of these guys he's
02:23:19.840 from Long Island
02:23:21.040 and I'll do my very best to butcher his
02:23:23.040 accent um but I was like so what's the
02:23:25.640 secret you know for you and he said
02:23:27.720 don't be cute and I was like what do you
02:23:29.240 mean by that he's like he's like a lot
02:23:31.160 of CEOs try and get cute he's like they
02:23:33.399 uh you know it's like backyard football
02:23:35.200 you've got you know you got this super
02:23:37.319 secret double reverse fake you know
02:23:40.479 thing and then you try and do it and
02:23:41.840 what happens he's like you fumble the
02:23:43.240 ball you lose 50 yards it's a complete
02:23:45.200 waste of time he's like but what what
02:23:47.479 plays always work he's like two fat guys
02:23:49.479 in the middle run to the right right
02:23:50.800 he's like don't be cute and so I I
02:23:53.800 actually took that to heart a lot which
02:23:55.160 is basically like growing a business is
02:23:57.800 a lot like backyard football and getting
02:23:59.640 good at sales is a lot like backyard
02:24:01.439 football the best
02:24:03.840 salespeople say the script they follow
02:24:06.880 up quickly they keep Rapport they ask
02:24:11.080 good questions they listen and they
02:24:13.359 allow the prospect to close themselves
02:24:15.760 so the thing that separates the good
02:24:17.760 sales people from the great people the
02:24:19.279 great salesp people is that the great
02:24:20.920 salespeople never don't do the basics
02:24:23.200 they always do the fundamentals and when
02:24:24.760 you always do the fundamentals you will
02:24:26.399 sustain exceptionally High close rates
02:24:28.279 they always prepare for each sales call
02:24:30.200 they always do the warm handoffs they
02:24:32.680 always refer to the notes rather than
02:24:34.120 asking the customer to recap they always
02:24:35.960 set the agenda with proof promise plan
02:24:37.640 they always do those things and that's
02:24:39.680 what allows them and then when they get
02:24:41.120 asked what do you do they're like I just
02:24:42.240 do the fundamentals man it's just that
02:24:44.000 doing the fundamentals is doing a lot of
02:24:46.040 things over and over and over again and
02:24:48.359 never forgetting any of the steps and so
02:24:50.560 that's what creates Mastery that's an
02:24:52.240 exhibition of skill so the next one is
02:24:55.080 that no isn't no forever no for Now does
02:25:00.319 not equal no
02:25:03.520 forever and so the big thing is think
02:25:06.439 about it this way let's say uh you were
02:25:09.600 in the dating pool and you've got this
02:25:11.319 girl or this guy that you've got your
02:25:12.920 eye on if they say hey I can't hang out
02:25:15.279 with you I'm predisposed I have whatever
02:25:17.960 and then let's say 6 months later there
02:25:20.319 they're single that no for now doesn't
02:25:23.000 mean you should never reach out to them
02:25:24.200 again it just might mean that right now
02:25:25.680 is not the perfect time because some of
02:25:27.279 the obstacles they gave you might be
02:25:28.640 legitimate they might have another
02:25:30.200 opportunity that is higher return than
02:25:32.120 whatever you're offering they might be
02:25:33.439 going through a merger and their team is
02:25:34.880 too spread thin and it's not worth the
02:25:36.160 resources to bring on more people to do
02:25:37.680 your implementation it's very possible
02:25:39.680 that now might not be a good time but it
02:25:42.120 doesn't mean that it's a no forever and
02:25:44.000 so I say this as like okay what's the
02:25:45.800 behavior that you're going to change as
02:25:47.000 a result of this is that you should not
02:25:48.800 be ashamed of reaching out every 3 to
02:25:51.080 six months just for a pulse check this
02:25:53.040 is where sending those fun memes or
02:25:55.080 those on line emails can make you so
02:25:57.760 much money because so many sales people
02:25:59.880 are afraid to follow up one because it's
02:26:01.920 work and two because they're afraid of
02:26:03.080 rejection but if you're not afraid of
02:26:04.800 work and you're not afraid of rejection
02:26:06.720 because you believe genuinely which you
02:26:08.520 should that you're going to help this
02:26:09.600 Prospect because they are qualified for
02:26:10.920 whatever the solution is then just
02:26:12.319 circle up when they have a better time
02:26:14.439 all right the next one is be a trash man
02:26:18.680 all right and so this is especially for
02:26:20.439 the younger closers uh that are you know
02:26:22.560 just getting into this um and so I'll
02:26:25.200 give you another one underneath of that
02:26:26.840 which is yellow equals gold
02:26:30.080 so in companies that we have we like to
02:26:32.760 do something called lead scoring which
02:26:34.319 is basically putting an approximation on
02:26:36.560 How likely it is that this lead closes
02:26:38.279 so earlier I told you the story of the
02:26:40.399 salesman who was uh you know selling
02:26:42.319 time shares became the number one guy
02:26:44.120 and the way that he was able to become
02:26:46.120 that super super duper closer was
02:26:47.600 because they began scoring leads so we
02:26:49.319 could say this guy who's got an 800
02:26:51.479 credit score and makes $500,000 a year
02:26:53.359 is more likely to buy a time share than
02:26:55.880 this person who's got you know six jobs
02:26:57.960 and 19 Kids and is on welfare and
02:27:00.479 whatever right like the likelihood is
02:27:01.960 it's higher that this person's going to
02:27:03.000 close so that person will get a higher
02:27:04.240 lead score and so what happens is
02:27:07.359 oftentimes you have a score Andor a
02:27:09.920 color that's associated with that so
02:27:11.000 you've got like greens yellows and reds
02:27:13.120 and so a red would be a just unqualified
02:27:15.279 yellows are like slightly qualified but
02:27:17.160 like probably a lower quality lead and
02:27:19.479 so if you're new salesperson you want to
02:27:21.760 be a trashman you want to be willing to
02:27:24.160 take as many calls as the company will
02:27:26.399 let you take and so think about this way
02:27:28.760 you are going to get free training from
02:27:31.680 the hardest leads which are the best
02:27:33.520 training grounds for you to learn how to
02:27:36.279 sell and so you need to think of those
02:27:38.800 yellows as Golds it's a reframe and so I
02:27:42.800 remember thinking about this when I was
02:27:44.920 selling in person that I had like some
02:27:47.920 homeless people who'd respond to my ads
02:27:49.840 and so they'd come in and i' you know I
02:27:52.600 had people just getting out of jail you
02:27:54.279 know after a 10e stint you know 30 days
02:27:56.240 earlier coming in like no job whatever
02:27:57.960 like I dealt with everything that came
02:27:59.040 in through the door and I thought about
02:28:00.640 it and I was like this is such a waste
02:28:01.760 of my time but I was like what if this
02:28:03.880 were amazing how could this be an
02:28:05.279 amazing thing for me and I was like well
02:28:06.920 man if I can close a homeless person if
02:28:08.840 I can close somebody who has no money no
02:28:10.640 job that would mean that I've gotten
02:28:12.200 really good at the skill and so I just
02:28:13.840 saw this is advanced level bosses that I
02:28:15.920 got to go against rather than this is a
02:28:17.840 waste of my time and so if you're
02:28:20.200 younger in the sales or and you're not
02:28:21.560 getting as many reps with the green
02:28:23.000 leads then ask for all the trash leads
02:28:25.760 because there's usually more than a
02:28:27.680 company can possibly handle in
02:28:29.040 unqualified now again if someone
02:28:31.680 literally cannot benefit from the
02:28:32.840 product don't sell it but if it's they
02:28:34.680 are less qualified as in like they have
02:28:36.439 less Financial Resources things like
02:28:38.000 that then you can still practice closing
02:28:41.200 and so think about it and we say this
02:28:42.560 term sharpen the sword is that you want
02:28:44.600 to just keep sharpening your skill
02:28:46.359 sharpening the axe taking more wax at
02:28:48.520 the tree and repetition is the mother of
02:28:51.279 skill and repeating yourself when it's a
02:28:53.680 hard Prospect to close just makes the
02:28:55.640 easier ones that much easier so this
02:28:58.319 next one sounds similar to things I've
02:28:59.840 said in the past but it's different so
02:29:02.960 objections do not mean no all
02:29:06.960 right so let me explain what I mean by
02:29:09.160 that so on one level obviously you can
02:29:11.160 overcome an objection with whatever
02:29:12.880 you're going to handle but a lot of
02:29:15.000 times they just are voicing out loud
02:29:18.279 their reaction this is especially true
02:29:20.160 when it comes to prices so if someone
02:29:22.640 says wow that's expensive it doesn't
02:29:25.359 mean automatically that you need to
02:29:26.880 start overcoming price objections you
02:29:28.840 could say yeah
02:29:31.240 totally it doesn't like there have
02:29:33.720 probably many times in your life when
02:29:35.080 you've been like oh that's expensive and
02:29:36.359 then you still bought it you just it was
02:29:38.319 expensive it was more than you expected
02:29:39.840 but it doesn't mean that you're not
02:29:40.760 going to buy and so a lot of times
02:29:42.600 people just say things as they come out
02:29:45.520 but it doesn't mean you're not buying
02:29:47.880 and so an experienced salesperson is
02:29:49.800 going to trying to start overcoming
02:29:50.920 things and you're basically like Wasting
02:29:52.560 Bullets on on on zombies that aren't
02:29:54.960 there they were going to close either
02:29:56.920 way that's not a real objection they
02:29:58.600 haven't said no they just made an
02:30:00.240 observation so unless someone says they
02:30:02.319 don't want to buy don't assume that they
02:30:04.359 don't want to buy next one is we don't
02:30:07.399 negotiate with terrorists which is never
02:30:11.120 change
02:30:13.240 price to close a
02:30:15.880 sale now the reason this is so important
02:30:18.240 is obviously one because people talk and
02:30:20.319 then customers won't like if you're
02:30:21.680 changing a sale price between different
02:30:23.720 customers now testing price absolutely
02:30:26.160 you should test your prices but that
02:30:27.279 should be done ahead of time
02:30:28.240 premeditated saying these next time
02:30:29.520 we're going to try this out and see what
02:30:31.000 happens not oh I got to close this guy
02:30:33.319 so I'm going to lower the price to do it
02:30:35.080 all right and so my favorite overcome
02:30:36.680 for hey can I do it can you guys do it
02:30:38.080 for Less is we could do it for more and
02:30:40.840 as silly as that sounds that has never
02:30:43.560 not worked for me and I'm still like I
02:30:45.880 have like a perfect batting average on
02:30:47.200 that one and so the thing is is that
02:30:49.359 it's such a high indication of
02:30:51.080 purchasing intention when someone says
02:30:53.080 can you do it for $500 less can you do
02:30:55.000 it for 30 grand instead of 50 Grand
02:30:56.880 whatever that just saying we could do it
02:30:59.399 for more what it does is it actually re
02:31:02.399 anchors so if you're familiar with
02:31:04.399 anchoring so let's say you say price is
02:31:06.520 this they say well I want to pay 20% off
02:31:10.080 that you then say cool well I'm going to
02:31:12.359 say plus 20% and so basically it re
02:31:14.720 anchors above it counter anchors and
02:31:17.000 then they have a fear of missing out
02:31:18.880 because all of a sudden the one price
02:31:20.160 now becomes even more and they're like
02:31:21.800 no no no no and a lot of times they just
02:31:23.439 say no no I'm good I'll buy I'm I'm fine
02:31:25.160 I'm fine and so uh never change price to
02:31:28.319 close a deal now you can change terms so
02:31:30.800 if you want to change how much they pay
02:31:32.200 today then you have a payment plan if
02:31:34.000 you want to change the uh components of
02:31:36.120 the offer then you have a feature
02:31:37.359 downsell those are very very different
02:31:39.640 than discounts that you give for no
02:31:42.040 reason and so you never negotiate with
02:31:44.080 terrorists because if they see you
02:31:46.520 change your price for them once they'll
02:31:48.359 believe that every price you have is
02:31:50.359 negotiable and then they'll tell
02:31:52.200 everyone it is too so the next one that
02:31:54.319 we'll cover is the idea that people want
02:31:58.120 to buy so think about this when you are
02:32:00.200 perusing on a site you want the thing
02:32:02.960 people usually want the stuff people
02:32:05.080 like buying the only reason that they
02:32:08.200 don't buy is because they have a history
02:32:10.080 of being punished for buying in the past
02:32:12.000 but they want to buy and so our job as
02:32:14.960 sales professionals or entrepreneurs is
02:32:17.399 to help them justify making the decision
02:32:20.960 and so people want an excuse to buy you
02:32:24.359 need to give it to them and so earlier I
02:32:26.399 said closers ask hard questions but my
02:32:28.120 team hit this hit this pretty hard for
02:32:29.760 me uh in terms of it being a big one so
02:32:31.680 I'm GNA I'm going to highlight it with a
02:32:32.920 little bit more detail so the reason
02:32:35.120 closers ask hard questions uh is because
02:32:38.720 they genuinely
02:32:40.040 care and the reason that's so important
02:32:43.080 is that you want to be kind not nice
02:32:46.399 because nice guys don't want to offend
02:32:48.399 someone kind people want to genuinely
02:32:51.640 help and if you want to genuinely help
02:32:54.160 then you want them to change their
02:32:55.720 behavior just like these things
02:32:57.160 hopefully change your behavior in terms
02:32:58.600 of selling and so that means that you
02:33:01.040 sometimes have to call them on their BS
02:33:03.680 and the tactful way to doing that is
02:33:06.960 that you want to confront those hard
02:33:08.560 questions one before you've asked for
02:33:10.359 money and two through foils of other
02:33:12.560 people like them this is what allows you
02:33:14.560 to stay in the pocket in the sale and
02:33:16.160 continue to ask the questions that
02:33:17.479 genuinely can change this person's life
02:33:20.160 and if you always come from the
02:33:21.439 perspective of human first you will
02:33:23.840 usually maintain Rapport if you don't
02:33:27.520 then what you will get is something we
02:33:28.800 call commission breath which is it
02:33:30.640 sounds like you're not listening to them
02:33:33.439 and you are prioritizing the closeth
02:33:36.080 over the person and that's where you
02:33:38.200 lose them completely because now they
02:33:40.160 feel like your incentives are no longer
02:33:41.720 aligned if you come at it from I want
02:33:44.200 the best thing for you then you will
02:33:45.880 always be on their side of the table
02:33:47.560 your incentives as far as they're
02:33:49.000 concerned will always always be aligned
02:33:50.439 with theirs and you will be able to ask
02:33:53.000 the questions that are actually going to
02:33:54.399 change their lives all right so those
02:33:56.640 are the behaviors that you can change as
02:33:58.760 a salesperson to make more sales
