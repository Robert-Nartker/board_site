# 4 Steps to Unf*** Your Business
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/kloJJeiysxg

00:00:00.080 there are four big levers in your
00:00:01.640 business that could be messed up I'll
00:00:03.439 show you how to figure out which one it
00:00:04.839 is and how to fix it so you can scale
00:00:06.680 your business most small businesses or
00:00:09.000 even even midsized businesses don't grow
00:00:11.320 as fast as they could because they spend
00:00:12.559 their time doing the wrong things
00:00:14.040 there's a lot of things that can make
00:00:15.400 the business more money the question is
00:00:16.680 just which of these things will make it
00:00:17.880 the most money and so by doing that we
00:00:21.080 have to reverse back into we had those
00:00:24.000 four levers that I had earlier we've got
00:00:25.400 traffic we've got conversion we've got
00:00:27.400 price and then we've got churn so those
00:00:28.920 are the big four things and so if we
00:00:30.880 want to grow the business those levers
00:00:33.079 have to change or the business will not
00:00:34.440 grow and
00:00:36.200 so for many of you it might just be you
00:00:39.320 need more traffic like the business
00:00:41.480 model is fine the economics are fine and
00:00:44.399 you need more traffic and so basically
00:00:46.800 at least my thought process that I have
00:00:48.640 with this is I try and scale as much as
00:00:51.160 I possibly can until something breaks
00:00:53.800 and then when it breaks we fix that
00:00:55.719 thing and then go back to scaling the
00:00:57.800 [ __ ] out of it again I mean fun Al
00:01:00.399 that's what we do and um I mean I I
00:01:03.600 teach this at at for for businesses but
00:01:05.799 I'll I'll walk you through it what is
00:01:07.759 going to go to these four levers that we
00:01:09.320 talked about earlier right which is
00:01:10.720 going to be your
00:01:13.840 traffic your two FS there whatever
00:01:16.560 conversion which is you tweaking your
00:01:18.400 about page making a vsl that's better
00:01:20.560 adding Carousel images tweaking the
00:01:22.439 bullets that you have on your landing
00:01:23.600 page uh you've got the price which you
00:01:25.560 can test and then you've got churn right
00:01:28.240 which has a big list of things that you
00:01:29.479 can do so these are the four levers the
00:01:31.520 things that you're doing have to Lad up
00:01:32.920 to one of these four if it doesn't lad
00:01:34.040 up to one of these four things why are
00:01:35.079 you doing it all right so like if we
00:01:36.840 were to translate your objective with
00:01:38.079 the free group you would have to say
00:01:40.000 okay I think that the US reactivating
00:01:42.920 the free group will increase traffic
00:01:45.119 that's fundamentally where you doing you
00:01:46.159 want this traffic source to make you
00:01:47.840 more money from your to towards your
00:01:49.880 ticket High ticket thing and you say
00:01:51.719 okay how much work will it take me to
00:01:54.360 reactivate this group okay is there
00:01:56.360 anything else that could get me more
00:01:57.680 traffic than reactivating the group of
00:02:00.079 the things that I have available so
00:02:01.439 right now could me just spending more
00:02:02.880 money on ads or making better ads make
00:02:05.240 us more than me spending the time to
00:02:06.920 reactivate the group if so forget
00:02:08.479 reactivating the group make better ads
00:02:11.038 or spend more money on ads does that
00:02:12.560 make sense so once you figure out and
00:02:14.640 when we're picking which of these three
00:02:15.959 things or four things that you're doing
00:02:18.040 the thought process is what which of
00:02:19.760 these is the biggest constraint in the
00:02:20.920 business and so if conversion rate let's
00:02:24.000 say for example on the on the landing
00:02:25.360 page is super low then it might mean
00:02:26.720 like hey before getting more traffic I'm
00:02:29.519 going to I think I can double my
00:02:31.120 conversion on this page because I
00:02:32.200 haven't really spent any time on it at
00:02:33.599 all okay well then it makes sense to
00:02:35.040 spend a day or two like can I really
00:02:37.319 clean this up and make it as crisp as
00:02:38.879 humanely possible with the language that
00:02:40.040 I use can I grab screenshots that are
00:02:41.560 more meaningful that like you probably
00:02:44.080 had more testimonials things like that
00:02:45.519 you haven't updated like can I put that
00:02:47.040 on there can I make an actual 3-minute
00:02:48.560 vssl that that is more compelling than
00:02:50.879 the one that I just like tossed up there
00:02:52.560 okay that's probably a day of work well
00:02:54.200 it's probably high leverage because I
00:02:55.480 can double the growth of the business by
00:02:57.280 just improving this conversion metric
00:02:59.200 pricing like well if everybody just pays
00:03:01.120 you more we already went through that
00:03:02.120 example over here um this could
00:03:04.440 obviously make you more money and then
00:03:05.560 you have your big list of things that
00:03:06.480 you're doing for turn and so cool which
00:03:09.400 of these is the biggest uh thing that's
00:03:10.840 going train in the business you pick the
00:03:12.000 one that you're working on and then for
00:03:14.040 me I tend to think through
00:03:17.560 this more better new and I tend to do it
00:03:23.200 in this order most of the time
00:03:27.159 so like I will just ask one of our
00:03:29.439 portfolio is like why can we not just do
00:03:31.280 more of what we're currently doing like
00:03:32.920 whatever we're doing why can't we just
00:03:34.120 do more so you'd have to make an
00:03:35.599 argument to me that we should reactivate
00:03:37.080 the group rather than just spending more
00:03:38.200 money on ads you have to make an
00:03:40.080 argument that it's easier and it will
00:03:41.599 make us more money than spending more
00:03:42.760 money on ads and if you came at the
00:03:44.560 argument they be like well then forget
00:03:45.519 about it if we can't do anymore for
00:03:47.760 whatever reason we have some limitation
00:03:49.200 like we can't post more than twice a day
00:03:50.760 on Instagram like we just can't or we
00:03:52.799 can it just like we've seen that when we
00:03:54.360 post three times it doesn't doesn't heal
00:03:56.040 the same performance so two is kind of
00:03:57.120 The Sweet Spot fine all right then what
00:03:59.079 can we do to make it better right okay
00:04:01.680 cuz if we can make those two posts just
00:04:03.599 higher quality overall can we like
00:04:04.920 really think through the hooks can we
00:04:06.040 make sure that they're tight that they
00:04:07.920 appeal ideally to the audience that
00:04:09.400 we're looking for if we do better then
00:04:11.760 the quality of the traffic will go up
00:04:13.000 the more views will go up does that make
00:04:15.120 sense now if we can't do any more any
00:04:16.639 better then we need to try something new
00:04:18.399 and you notice that most of the times
00:04:19.478 you can do more of what you're doing you
00:04:21.120 can do what you're doing better which is
00:04:22.440 why I so rarely do new things once you
00:04:24.479 have something that works that's the
00:04:25.680 hard part once it works it's like how do
00:04:27.280 we scale the living crap out of it and
00:04:28.800 the reason that most not in my opinion
00:04:30.199 especially small ones get stuck is that
00:04:31.880 they find something that works and they
00:04:33.000 stop doing
00:04:34.000 it and then they get distracted by six
00:04:36.680 other new things and they get completely
00:04:38.520 spread thin and it's and like what's
00:04:40.039 ironic is that the small business owner
00:04:42.479 is the one who has the least amount of
00:04:44.080 Leverage and you have the basically your
00:04:47.039 your contribution your time contribution
00:04:48.919 to the the income of the business is
00:04:50.800 more direct than anybody else's
00:04:52.600 especially at this level and so like you
00:04:54.800 like saying okay I'm going to take a
00:04:55.759 third of my time that might just be like
00:04:56.919 decreasing your business by a third um
00:04:59.120 so you have to have a argument for why
00:05:00.960 that's going to make sense and then for
00:05:02.759 who once you have a team then that
00:05:04.560 becomes the the next thing it's like
00:05:05.919 okay we know we to increase traffic the
00:05:07.759 way that we're going to do that is like
00:05:08.680 we can't do more posts on Instagram so
00:05:09.880 we're going to make them better and this
00:05:11.280 is the process that we're going to focus
00:05:12.400 on getting better which means that uh
00:05:14.039 once a week I'm going to take three
00:05:15.120 hours and I'm going to script out I'm
00:05:17.240 going to look at other people's you know
00:05:18.680 content that have really good hooks I'm
00:05:19.880 going to write down all the hooks and
00:05:21.319 then I'm going to make content that I
00:05:23.440 think is going to appeal to my
00:05:24.600 demographic in a better way cool now
00:05:27.520 who's going to be you know if it's you
00:05:29.160 then you're the who in a lot of these if
00:05:31.160 the business gets bigger then it's like
00:05:32.479 okay Jeremy you're running this and then
00:05:35.520 we just measure to make sure Jeremy does
00:05:36.720 his job that makes sense in terms of
00:05:38.880 thinking through this and so we just
00:05:40.240 want to make sure that what you are
00:05:41.319 doing is going to map to what's going to
00:05:43.880 drive growth within the
00:05:45.520 business and I swear to God so many
00:05:48.319 times people are just doing [ __ ] that
00:05:49.800 does not map to
00:05:51.759 this okay Red's
00:05:54.720 over one quick question on that the the
00:05:56.960 first four is there like a certain
00:05:58.880 priority that you would recommend for
00:06:00.280 like I'm a solo operator I'm doing like
00:06:02.039 50 a month BC offer is there like one of
00:06:04.560 those big four that you would recommend
00:06:05.600 prioritizing first start
00:06:08.720 here because this is how you have
00:06:10.720 lifeblood in the business so you have to
00:06:12.800 promote you have to acquire customers
00:06:14.840 once this is relatively consistent even
00:06:16.639 at a low level I then this is me how I
00:06:18.919 think through this now not when I was
00:06:20.720 younger normally I would just be like
00:06:22.400 just do as much of this as you can
00:06:23.759 forget everything else now it's do
00:06:26.199 enough of this so that we can keep
00:06:29.599 working on how do we how do we find the
00:06:31.639 things that people actually want versus
00:06:33.039 what we think they want and then there
00:06:34.759 the things that we can remove like how
00:06:36.360 can we delete things how can we make
00:06:37.680 this simpler how can we make it more
00:06:38.680 elegant how can we shorten the the
00:06:40.880 moduls that we have I mean we're hiding
00:06:43.120 classroom for new people like think
00:06:44.440 about this like we remove three calls a
00:06:46.440 week like we're trying to take things
00:06:47.560 away not because we don't want to add
00:06:49.039 it's easy for us to add the value it's
00:06:50.479 but we want we want them to consume it
00:06:52.560 and so consumption should be the highest
00:06:54.000 priority for everybody here in terms of
00:06:55.840 making like how do they get value they
00:06:57.440 have to consume value right so
00:06:58.800 consumption should be the high priority
00:07:00.720 and so um we start here until you have
00:07:04.000 enough flow going through the system
00:07:06.160 that we can see what they really want
00:07:08.639 and a lot of times these simple things
00:07:10.240 like the last semester I think we went
00:07:11.680 through a ton of depth of all the things
00:07:14.000 that you can do to reduce ch right it's
00:07:16.120 like so you experiment with that and
00:07:17.360 this might be months while you're doing
00:07:18.960 this I mean for context school didn't
00:07:20.639 hit like a like let's go hypers scale
00:07:23.280 until like recently and this was years
00:07:25.879 right of getting the product right like
00:07:27.319 obviously like there's people coming in
00:07:29.199 every day and there was enough promotion
00:07:31.240 that we basically we could test and keep
00:07:33.120 learning but it wasn't like we don't
00:07:35.160 want the world to find out about it yet
00:07:36.400 because we want to get all these pieces
00:07:37.720 right once these pieces are right enough
00:07:40.400 then you go back here you scale living
00:07:42.240 hell out of it boom yeah it's
00:07:46.879 great so right now the question for you
00:07:49.680 is if you have really low turn I don't
00:07:52.080 know if you do but from what you were
00:07:53.120 saying it sounds like you have low turn
00:07:56.159 then then yeah do more traffic yeah do
00:07:58.720 more do better of what you're currently
00:08:00.319 doing so you're are you running ads yeah
00:08:02.400 so You' spend more spend more Mak them
00:08:04.039 better top 20% of my best customers
00:08:07.240 targeted towards them now that I have
00:08:08.960 that insight and then just keep making
00:08:09.960 that better and then just more more
00:08:12.120 better and then just spend 400 Grand a
00:08:13.599 month on ads yeah
00:08:16.479 sure I mean it's like an inside joke in
00:08:18.599 my business like he's just going to say
00:08:20.479 more better it's like y that's what
00:08:22.080 we're going to do this quarter just like
00:08:23.000 we did last quarter just like we did the
00:08:24.080 quarter before we're going to do more
00:08:25.080 we're going to do better and if we do
00:08:25.919 both of those things we'll probably make
00:08:26.879 more money and then if there's something
00:08:29.080 that prevents from doing more or better
00:08:30.479 then we fix that and then we go back to
00:08:31.680 more better does anyone have questions
00:08:33.399 about what they need to do for
00:08:35.760 this like like you need you're like okay
00:08:38.159 am I should I be spending more money
00:08:39.479 well if your if your LTV is good in
00:08:41.479 terms and your and your and your CAC is
00:08:43.320 low then yeah I just keep
00:08:45.000 spending I guess for like low ticket
00:08:47.279 communities you know recently you had a
00:08:48.920 video where you went like seven things
00:08:50.680 like a handwritten letters on boing ex
00:08:53.240 interviews yeah for communities on
00:08:54.839 school like which one of these would you
00:08:56.560 go after the first kirby I feel like you
00:08:59.040 have even more insight with you the
00:09:01.920 price sounds like the thing that's
00:09:03.480 moving at say again the price okay
00:09:06.800 because you've already experience what
00:09:08.399 that's doing right you know the average
00:09:10.240 is around 20 you probably want to be on
00:09:12.120 the good side of that so figure out why
00:09:14.720 you're
00:09:15.760 not like I would talk to your customers
00:09:18.399 first like why did you cancel you want
00:09:20.240 to talk to the people that cancelled you
00:09:21.600 want to talk to the people that stayed
00:09:23.600 and you want to figure out what
00:09:24.920 differences they have and then if you
00:09:27.600 find the people that stayed did these
00:09:29.800 things emphasize those things if you
00:09:31.959 find the people that left did other
00:09:33.399 things remove those and so it might not
00:09:36.279 be price I'm just yeah it but you told
00:09:39.000 us so um maybe it's price so like
00:09:43.720 balance that and then you know with your
00:09:47.440 traffic you you can drive more of that
00:09:51.519 and then you can play with about page
00:09:53.560 conversion you can play with that and
00:09:55.560 then when you're bought of those go back
00:09:56.880 to retention ch I can drive like easily
00:10:00.480 way more traffic it's just that I have a
00:10:02.040 leaky bucket so I want to fix it so I'm
00:10:04.480 like wondering if I should add the
00:10:05.880 onboarding or you know onboarding I
00:10:08.240 think for sure is a good idea and how
00:10:09.920 would you execute that for low tickets
00:10:11.959 you do a group onboarding and everybody
00:10:13.640 who signs up gets one group
00:10:16.160 onboarding that you attend you do it
00:10:18.399 once a week yeah I think people throw a
00:10:20.640 lot of [ __ ] in their community and then
00:10:22.120 they just keep adding and then they
00:10:24.240 think they need to keep adding to make
00:10:25.640 it better but it's not true like
00:10:27.839 overwhelm is the main cause of Chun
00:10:30.040 think about the experience so how many
00:10:32.519 things in the classroom would you say is
00:10:34.079 like The Sweet Spot cuz like right now I
00:10:36.000 have like eight
00:10:38.680 maybe honestly the hardest part I found
00:10:41.000 when improving anything is to figure out
00:10:42.519 what's actually wrong with it that I've
00:10:45.639 been working on the school games funnel
00:10:47.160 recently by the way homos will be happy
00:10:49.160 about this
00:10:51.959 um I figured out like what the problem
00:10:55.079 to try to figure out what the problem
00:10:56.399 was was actually quite difficult but and
00:10:59.560 the was my it was this guy I knew from
00:11:02.519 New Zealand who's a complete stoner that
00:11:05.680 had text me when hosi when hosi launched
00:11:08.800 the games he couldn't understand what it
00:11:11.040 was and I was not going to try to
00:11:13.160 explain it to him but when we came back
00:11:15.519 to making this improving it I was like
00:11:18.839 it turned out that he was the best
00:11:20.760 signal for it actually what the [ __ ] is
00:11:23.839 the school games I wrote it down that
00:11:26.200 was the problem if you didn't know what
00:11:28.079 school was you and you see an ad from
00:11:30.440 homos and he's talking about the school
00:11:31.639 games and some leader boards and coming
00:11:33.040 to Vegas people don't know what the [ __ ]
00:11:35.639 that is so I wrote down what the [ __ ] is
00:11:38.639 the school games and I was like that is
00:11:40.240 the
00:11:41.200 problem so but that took me a lot of
00:11:43.920 research to to like find right I was
00:11:47.800 talking to a lot of people I was doing
00:11:49.279 this with Kirby it's quite an
00:11:50.720 interesting process right and then we
00:11:53.360 were like okay well how do we describe
00:11:55.440 this damn thing in a way that is make
00:11:58.120 sense to like aone own dude um because
00:12:02.320 it helps to use extreme cases like Steve
00:12:04.760 Jobs tested products on children because
00:12:07.480 like if they could understand it anyone
00:12:09.399 could understand it right
00:12:12.360 so like defining the problem and then
00:12:15.959 coming up with different ways you could
00:12:17.480 solve it I've been doing this with goose
00:12:19.040 and Kirby in the office all week we
00:12:21.360 probably designed we came up with many
00:12:23.279 different ways to describe what it is
00:12:25.320 many different landing pages many
00:12:27.560 different bullets and just kept talking
00:12:30.800 to users getting feedback and kept
00:12:32.680 iterating it we probably made 30
00:12:35.560 versions some of them were so wrong it
00:12:37.959 was I wondered what kind of
00:12:41.000 tangent you'll never see
00:12:44.040 it but you know we actually at the end
00:12:46.880 of about one week we landed on something
00:12:49.720 and um and now everyone we show it to
00:12:51.920 instantly gets it it's like we don't
00:12:53.839 actually have to fully launch to find
00:12:56.720 out when you learn how you can use
00:12:59.279 everyone to get like feedback and talk
00:13:01.000 to people and show it to people and get
00:13:02.399 their reactions you can do a lot of fast
00:13:04.680 iteration Cycles without the harshness
00:13:08.000 of like reality then when you launch it
00:13:10.639 into reality you have a way better
00:13:12.079 chance right um so that's how you
00:13:16.240 improve anything like that that's not
00:13:18.800 the games but that's what we were doing
00:13:20.880 to the games recently we Kirby was doing
00:13:24.279 interviews with all of the winners that
00:13:26.800 was overwhelming not many people were
00:13:28.320 showing up so we cut that we just did
00:13:30.519 one hosy Q&A a week right attendance is
00:13:34.839 up every viewing is up people and now
00:13:37.680 saying that it's way more
00:13:40.800 valuable and you know so
00:13:44.639 it's we were unlocking the one day
00:13:46.959 recordings after you got three customers
00:13:49.680 we like why are we making it hard to get
00:13:51.720 the most valuable
00:13:53.680 thing now you just need three members
00:13:56.000 they can be
00:13:57.079 free right so like what do people value
00:14:00.279 how do we make more people experience
00:14:02.360 that what do people not value take it
00:14:03.880 out what do people not understand reword
00:14:07.000 it you see it's all the same but I I
00:14:10.120 will I will I will emphasize what Sam
00:14:12.160 saying is that there's a it's so much
00:14:13.839 more work than you expected to be and
00:14:15.839 everyone wants like the one silver
00:14:17.240 bullet that you're going to magically
00:14:18.440 fall on it but if it were obvious you
00:14:20.120 would have already done it and so it's
00:14:22.199 like it's disguised and that's what I
00:14:24.360 mean this is literally what makes
00:14:25.680 business hard and so I'll have a
00:14:28.160 business owner on a Q&A call say like
00:14:29.680 what should my price be and I'm like I
00:14:31.079 don't know I'll walk you through the
00:14:32.279 process of how I'd figure it out but I
00:14:33.800 don't know your avatar I don't know your
00:14:35.040 traffic scour I don't know the value
00:14:36.440 Prof of your community and even if I did
00:14:38.920 I would say I'll start here and I'm
00:14:41.199 going to do the math and I'll move it
00:14:42.959 and I'll do the math I mean with a
00:14:44.480 portfolio same thing I was telling I was
00:14:45.800 like we tested 50 35 25 15 we just
00:14:48.920 tested it I was like I don't know we'll
00:14:50.360 find out and then they were all the
00:14:53.680 same and then I was like okay well which
00:14:55.639 business would I prefer and then we go
00:14:56.720 into that right and so just just in
00:14:58.720 terms of thinking through things like
00:15:00.120 the amount of effort that goes into it
00:15:02.279 that most I would say that like as I've
00:15:03.839 gone as I've G moved up in business the
00:15:06.759 my understanding of the level of effort
00:15:08.079 that's required to solve complex
00:15:09.160 problems has gone up
00:15:11.000 100x it's just significantly harder to
00:15:13.839 solve more complex problems and that's
00:15:15.600 also why the biggest paydays are on the
00:15:18.399 other side of those problems because if
00:15:20.440 they were really easy to solve everyone
00:15:21.519 have already solved
00:15:22.639 it so it's like four hours in a cup of
00:15:24.839 coffee and a bunch of data and you're
00:15:25.839 like all right let's try
00:15:27.959 this there's a quote I learned from the
00:15:30.199 software engineers at school they say
00:15:33.040 you have to make every detail perfect
00:15:35.720 but the only way you can do that is to
00:15:37.360 limit the amount of details that you
00:15:39.160 have so inside of the school games we
00:15:41.399 have eight videos all of them together
00:15:43.600 are less than 45 minutes one course we
00:15:46.440 do one call per week and that's
00:15:49.279 it and once a month you get a download
00:15:52.079 from here the Mastermind that's it very
00:15:55.880 easy to explain to someone one call one
00:15:58.600 course one Mastermind them
00:16:00.560 up and there's 13,000 people in there
00:16:03.480 each paying 99 them
00:16:05.240 up and they get the school
00:16:07.330 [Music]
00:16:08.680 software have a question yeah so there's
00:16:12.519 a fine balance between because if you're
00:16:14.959 a leader of a big Community right if
00:16:17.319 you're showing up too much you kind of
00:16:19.839 almost lose your power right and if you
00:16:22.759 do Q&A every single day nobody want it's
00:16:26.560 not special so how would you balance Q a
00:16:29.199 CS making posts inside of the community
00:16:32.000 and just showing up and like giving
00:16:34.680 people attention like that I'm sure
00:16:37.199 there's a data answer for this rather
00:16:38.800 than me just guessing we can probably
00:16:40.440 find it out of like what the the best
00:16:42.639 you know Cadence is I'll tell you I
00:16:44.360 personally I think post twice a month in
00:16:46.000 school that's not planned I just I just
00:16:49.399 kind of poke around and I see what
00:16:50.800 people are struggling with I made that
00:16:51.920 Niche post because I was really tired of
00:16:54.040 people be like what's my Niche going to
00:16:55.759 be about and I was like here's how you
00:16:57.519 find your niche and so it's just like I
00:17:00.079 just listened to what was the like
00:17:01.639 there's you probably noticed this in
00:17:02.880 your communities it's probably like a
00:17:04.039 pro like a problem dour it's like people
00:17:06.359 just kind of glob on to a single problem
00:17:08.039 all of a sudden and like I felt like I
00:17:09.679 was seeing more and more of that so I
00:17:11.679 was like all right I'm going to try and
00:17:12.679 answer this and so then you make that
00:17:14.760 and then it's like hopefully and if it
00:17:16.000 does if you put the thing in and then
00:17:17.599 that problem still exists then you
00:17:19.359 didn't do it right so it's like you have
00:17:20.679 to do it again you have to make it
00:17:21.599 simpler you have to make it easier
00:17:22.559 whatever it is you keep doing it until
00:17:24.240 that one goes away and then like the
00:17:25.439 next problem will occur and the good
00:17:26.799 news is that your customers will always
00:17:28.520 have problems yeah and so you just solve
00:17:31.120 them I can tell you a good thing that
00:17:33.120 works for
00:17:34.280 me um so I spend a lot of my time
00:17:38.760 reading what people are saying like I'm
00:17:40.880 trying to understand what things people
00:17:42.440 are struggling with so I'm not in there
00:17:44.960 just posting a lot I'm in there
00:17:46.400 listening the most more than anything
00:17:49.039 else most it would be like 90 it would
00:17:52.240 be like a lot of time has spent
00:17:54.440 listening trying to figure out what is
00:17:57.360 going on what should I improve what
00:17:59.080 problems is the community facing right
00:18:02.039 then when I'm pretty sure I've got those
00:18:04.600 problems I'll even talk to some power
00:18:07.080 users and I'll validate do you think
00:18:08.799 these are actually problems right and
00:18:11.480 then I'll make sure I'm clear on the
00:18:12.919 problems first okay now if I spend now
00:18:16.240 prioritize them what's the most what is
00:18:18.440 the most pressing problem okay number
00:18:20.080 one now I'll just focus on that at least
00:18:22.600 I know if I just fix that I'll add some
00:18:24.400 value right yeah so now I'll try to fix
00:18:27.480 that and I will try to fix that by
00:18:31.159 research experimentation Etc and then
00:18:33.880 I'll come back to my community and say
00:18:35.400 hey I saw all of you guys were facing
00:18:38.280 this it
00:18:40.360 sucks I fixed it here you
00:18:44.520 go and that's how I like that's how you
00:18:47.039 add value seriously no like I have I
00:18:49.760 have this little template on my wall for
00:18:51.480 emails which is uh hey I made this thing
00:18:53.840 for you here's what it does good
00:18:57.039 afternoon enjoy like CTA like that's
00:19:00.480 like that's my email template it it just
00:19:02.679 makes it really simple like hey you guys
00:19:03.960 were struggling with this thing I made
00:19:05.280 this for you here's why it's important
00:19:06.880 and goodbye the hard part is finding the
00:19:09.200 thing yeah like I said how do we make
00:19:11.799 the school games funnel better well
00:19:14.360 what's the problem with it that's the
00:19:16.640 real
00:19:17.600 question and it was some Stoner dude who
00:19:20.000 had the
00:19:21.960 answer yeah so you wouldn't have a
00:19:24.080 schedule of like posting daily or second
00:19:26.960 like every second day or definitely not
00:19:28.880 yeah that's like a Henry Ford production
00:19:32.520 line for Community like we're not trying
00:19:34.760 to pump out posts fast that's not what
00:19:37.679 makes a robotic it's not that's not a
00:19:40.960 good Community a good Community is
00:19:42.880 something
00:19:44.200 that understands your pain and
00:19:47.240 experience and delivers Solutions and is
00:19:51.080 fun yeah you right yeah and isn't
00:19:55.000 overwhelming and doesn't make me read
00:19:57.440 five articles day right like value Post
00:20:01.559 Yeah cuz I don't want to read a bloody
00:20:03.679 article that's a pain in the ass like I
00:20:06.360 want a
00:20:07.600 solution or I want to
00:20:10.240 laugh one of them yeah I'm doing 17
00:20:13.880 lives a week in my paid at the moment
00:20:18.080 so but my my feelings telling me to put
00:20:20.720 it in the free community but I mean that
00:20:22.039 might be stupid cuz I'm trying to listen
00:20:23.159 to what you guys are saying you're
00:20:24.200 saying no we're just doing one now and
00:20:25.559 it's like so I'm a bit the [ __ ] you know
00:20:28.720 I think if you want to use all that like
00:20:30.080 all that so last last games a ton of
00:20:33.600 people I think it was last games it was
00:20:35.799 like it was like the lives games there
00:20:37.200 like everybody was doing like Instagram
00:20:39.480 lives might have been maybe two ago um
00:20:42.720 and that the thing is is like we have to
00:20:44.039 separate promotion from delivery so from
00:20:46.720 a promotion perspective you're doing
00:20:48.400 lots and lots of lives you're making
00:20:49.600 lots of posts you're making all this
00:20:50.840 stuff oh no I understand I got you and
00:20:53.520 so my point is is like I would take all
00:20:55.480 that energy and put it into promotion so
00:20:58.679 you get way more people into your
00:21:00.000 community and then the thing is is that
00:21:02.600 you if you do 17 lives a week externally
00:21:06.080 it's okay that people don't consume all
00:21:08.240 of them because if they consume one of
00:21:09.600 them then they might buy whereas if
00:21:11.880 you're inside of the community and
00:21:13.000 you're doing 17 they might be like Oh
00:21:15.080 I'm missing out on 16 out of the 17 I'm
00:21:17.520 not I'm not getting the value if it's
00:21:19.600 free your cost is time and so as long as
00:21:22.760 you deliver a return on the time that
00:21:24.880 they spend consuming your content then
00:21:26.480 they got they have a positive exchange
00:21:27.919 with you and so you basically it's like
00:21:30.320 you can never promote too much you can
00:21:32.120 put too much inside of the community and
00:21:33.600 so I would take some of that Juju and
00:21:35.279 put it externally to drive more through
00:21:36.720 the box I think Hamza actually did like
00:21:39.559 the opposite like when he increased the
00:21:42.000 daily coffee to like nearly every day um
00:21:45.120 his churn like reduced massively so I
00:21:47.400 have no idea oh he's messaging me like
00:21:50.400 every day
00:21:52.600 and trying to figure out like all kinds
00:21:55.080 of things around churn at the moment um
00:21:58.880 I my answer to him he kept coming up
00:22:00.520 with ideas my answer to him was talk to
00:22:02.320 your customers I recently was pretty
00:22:04.240 public about this is that like I widened
00:22:06.200 my content for I think either three or
00:22:07.880 six months I like started sprinkling in
00:22:10.080 some other other pieces I talked about
00:22:12.279 how I eat and like Leila you know how L
00:22:14.679 and I run you know being married and
00:22:16.360 things like that and the the the problem
00:22:19.360 is that you do get positive
00:22:20.600 reinforcement from it and so it's like
00:22:22.120 he made some stuff on relationships and
00:22:23.559 then people were like oh this is awesome
00:22:25.279 but the thing is is like the wrong
00:22:26.480 people were saying it was awesome and so
00:22:28.600 happening is my audience was growing but
00:22:29.880 it was growing with the wrong people and
00:22:31.799 so I had I mean I had this moment where
00:22:34.559 like sometimes you have these like I had
00:22:36.039 a a friend of mine come into a friend
00:22:39.200 acquaintance I would say flew in and was
00:22:41.000 like um he probably does 10 million
00:22:43.080 bucks a year and uh and he was like yeah
00:22:45.400 you know um yeah I don't I don't listen
00:22:47.559 to too much of your stuff anymore and
00:22:48.840 he's like yeah I was Hardcore for like
00:22:50.039 six years um and then I I just kind of
00:22:52.400 um I guess it didn't really apply to me
00:22:53.919 anymore he's like guess I'm not really
00:22:55.039 like your avatar and I was like you're
00:22:57.840 100 room was [ __ ] Avatar like you are
00:22:59.919 exactly who I'm going after and then I
00:23:02.840 was like oh I'm a [ __ ] and I just
00:23:05.640 basically it's like you you get you get
00:23:08.480 it's a balance like you want to listen
00:23:09.840 to customers but you also want to make
00:23:10.799 sure you're listening to the right
00:23:11.559 customers and so um I reoriented all my
00:23:15.080 my content which maybe some of you guys
00:23:16.320 have seen um and it's been 100% back to
00:23:19.080 business has been the the theme that we
00:23:20.320 have internally my guys now um is that
00:23:22.320 if it's not business we don't make it
00:23:23.480 just very straightforward like it can be
00:23:25.480 business adjacent so like if I talk
00:23:26.960 about you know prioritizing like tasks
00:23:28.919 in my day that can have some element of
00:23:30.360 productivity into it but it's like all
00:23:31.799 my examples are going to be business
00:23:32.799 related and so but by doing that when I
00:23:36.799 looked objectively across metrics for
00:23:39.320 site conversion opin Book Sales
00:23:41.919 applications to the portfolio all of
00:23:43.799 those metrics went up even though the
00:23:45.440 average view per video went
00:23:47.799 down and so it's like I'm not in this to
00:23:50.080 get famous I'm in this to make money
00:23:52.039 cool question um I wonder if anybody has
00:23:54.960 I this might be for everybody but like
00:23:56.400 has anybody done anything to when they
00:23:58.039 do have have a turned customer to get
00:24:00.279 them back into being a customer or SE a
00:24:03.480 funny gift you just send a funny gift
00:24:06.159 and a DM ask credit paner have you seen
00:24:09.320 him yeah ask him for his message he's
00:24:12.320 apparently got some message he DMS
00:24:14.159 people with a funny gift and it gets
00:24:16.440 people to reactivate just say it's like
00:24:18.159 something like leaving so soon is kind
00:24:19.919 of like the vibe is kind of yeah but you
00:24:21.480 want to get the funny gift of course
00:24:23.559 yeah and it's just within school yeah
00:24:25.760 okay so no email SMS or anything like
00:24:27.720 that our sales team has that for ghosted
00:24:29.720 leads they have a Kevin Hart uh meme
00:24:32.240 that's like I think that might be it I
00:24:35.159 think that's what he's using
00:24:37.159 yeah and uh yeah it like it gets higher
00:24:40.120 response rates than any any message this
00:24:42.039 is kind of for both of you probably you
00:24:44.679 Sam as well definitely some um but I
00:24:46.600 guess like when you're building you know
00:24:47.840 a startup um obviously you know you
00:24:51.760 might have sometimes you might have a
00:24:52.840 little bit lack of capital little lack
00:24:54.159 of resources I guess how do you get a
00:24:57.279 players to work
00:24:59.080 for you and with you and how do you like
00:25:01.279 structure comp structures and all that
00:25:03.120 so it like the vision for the business
00:25:04.960 has to be big enough that smart people
00:25:06.520 can fit their dreams inside of it and so
00:25:08.960 if you want brains then you need people
00:25:11.559 who like they need to be able to believe
00:25:13.960 that their dreams can come true within
00:25:15.520 your vision if it's again if it's like
00:25:17.279 yeah we've just got a couple groups that
00:25:18.960 we're running and we're making money
00:25:20.120 then it's like that doesn't like really
00:25:22.520 get me motivated if I'm intelligent I'm
00:25:24.720 because like the best people have
00:25:26.080 there's no lack of opportunity for best
00:25:27.720 people they have tons like you have to
00:25:29.760 think about this is It's a totally
00:25:30.960 different game like you're if you're
00:25:32.720 accustomed to taking people like I
00:25:34.000 really want a job all of those people
00:25:35.960 are relevant you have to be people who
00:25:38.039 are like in some ways you're competing
00:25:40.120 for them so the more you're competing
00:25:41.799 for a prospect like selling them and so
00:25:44.240 if you feel like like I'll tell you the
00:25:45.679 funny one is like if you're interviewing
00:25:48.240 people where you're like sell me on why
00:25:49.919 I should take you if you say that to
00:25:51.240 somebody who's actually really talented
00:25:53.600 they'll be like I'm
00:25:56.880 good like they just like they just don't
00:25:59.679 like I you have to respond to this offer
00:26:01.640 within 12 hours it's like okay yeah I
00:26:05.320 think you hit the nail right there for
00:26:06.520 me like their Vision has to be our
00:26:07.919 vision needs to be big enough for their
00:26:09.200 dreams to fit into it you have to be
00:26:10.360 able to say like what we want to do is
00:26:11.760 we want to make music money into the
00:26:13.559 standard for this and then they have to
00:26:15.960 believe with a decent amount of
00:26:17.200 certainty that it's possible and so like
00:26:19.520 how you guys present like you are
00:26:21.600 absolutely selling them and so like I
00:26:23.960 think Drew this about on on a past one
00:26:25.720 but everybody here understands you know
00:26:28.600 lead generation lead nurture sales
00:26:32.120 onboarding and then you know retention
00:26:34.320 Ascension right that's the how you do
00:26:36.120 with customers right this is the exact
00:26:38.360 same process for an employer you
00:26:39.960 generate applications you nurture
00:26:41.679 applications the sale is the interview
00:26:43.760 you onboard the employee and then either
00:26:46.159 retain them or Ascend them it's the same
00:26:48.919 thing and so you basically have to
00:26:50.360 understand the acquis like this is when
00:26:51.600 we get into scaling because everyone's
00:26:52.840 like two three people are like what's
00:26:54.320 scaling is it's just where the inflow of
00:26:56.720 talent in the business matches the flow
00:26:59.000 of customers into the business and you
00:27:01.399 have to have an exceptional conversion
00:27:02.880 process for attracting Talent this is
00:27:04.760 where brand counts double it counts once
00:27:07.799 on the front end for customers and again
00:27:09.559 on the back end for talent and it
00:27:11.039 becomes either a virtuous cycle or a
00:27:12.760 vicious cycle either destroys your
00:27:14.720 business you have a bad brand because
00:27:17.080 what do you think what like what um like
00:27:19.159 great talent will look at your reviews
00:27:21.720 and be like oh this is yeah never mind
00:27:24.520 it would work at a good place so I guess
00:27:26.720 in last question I guess what what would
00:27:28.760 be the best way to like acquire Talent
00:27:30.559 is it just building a personal brand
00:27:32.559 like in our field of work cuz I don't
00:27:34.840 think it's necessarily like I can't I
00:27:36.880 don't feel like I can find the right
00:27:38.000 people on LinkedIn or something like
00:27:39.640 that you know for what we're trying to
00:27:40.679 do it needs to be people who are kind of
00:27:42.080 like I'm already kind of entrepreneurs
00:27:44.159 or people who are in more of like the
00:27:45.880 sales or manager manager field it really
00:27:48.080 depends on what role you're looking for
00:27:49.440 but I can promise you that very smart
00:27:51.080 people are on LinkedIn do you know how I
00:27:55.760 um I I looked I got invited to speak at
00:27:58.519 something I looked at who else was
00:28:00.039 speaking there and I saw who mosy was
00:28:01.360 speaking there and I was all right
00:28:04.000 that's my
00:28:05.320 opportunity that was the first time we
00:28:06.919 met in person yeah honestly so cool how
00:28:09.440 long ago was
00:28:10.440 that one year before I spoke about doing
00:28:13.600 a deal but you have to like be strategic
00:28:18.240 sometimes
00:28:20.559 yeah and then so you have to kind of do
00:28:23.279 this old school networking thing which I
00:28:25.039 [ __ ] hate
00:28:26.519 because it's like the only any time I've
00:28:28.519 ever done that the horos deal was like
00:28:31.519 the one deal to never do that again um
00:28:35.799 but yeah you kind of have to do that I
00:28:38.480 had to start going to like these
00:28:40.000 software things I had to start to meet
00:28:42.880 some software Engineers I had to learn
00:28:45.240 about their world I had to ask people
00:28:47.799 about why does what do you hate as a
00:28:50.480 software engineer what do you like what
00:28:51.880 makes a good company what makes a Bad
00:28:53.279 Company you have to like learn
00:28:56.000 everything about it and n work and do
00:29:00.000 that it it really sucks honestly but if
00:29:02.120 you're serious about it I knew there was
00:29:03.799 no way I could build school without this
00:29:05.679 person so I delayed starting it by a
00:29:08.960 year just to find the
00:29:11.399 person yeah so I was like I'm not even
00:29:13.559 going to start until I find them like
00:29:16.200 that's how essential I knew they were
00:29:18.399 that's why I tell everyone to not do
00:29:20.279 software it's just because the scale of
00:29:22.480 how difficult it is to actually do a
00:29:23.919 right is so hard that
00:29:26.159 like no basically no one does it right
00:29:29.279 even when you know even if you know what
00:29:30.559 you're doing most people can't do it and
00:29:32.519 most people who are quote in the info
00:29:33.880 world are like oh my info thing is INS
00:29:36.120 salable so I'm going to build software
00:29:37.840 and they just think that like white
00:29:38.919 labeling go high level means they have a
00:29:40.360 software company um
00:29:42.880 like but I mean right and or they create
00:29:46.320 some widget that someone else can
00:29:47.679 duplicate in five seconds that they did
00:29:49.799 off with an offshore developer that like
00:29:52.159 if it actually did work then that
00:29:53.360 developer would hold you Ransom and then
00:29:54.799 what like they just don't play it out
00:29:55.960 two steps and the coach [ __ ] anyways and
00:29:58.880 it's all it all sucks like yeah don't do
00:30:01.840 it yeah I some like you're just you
00:30:04.679 don't want us to succeed that's why cuz
00:30:06.240 you're you're doing so I was like no man
00:30:07.760 I saw that Sam put five years in it I
00:30:09.799 was like great okay I saw the metrics I
00:30:12.000 was like okay this is legit I spend all
00:30:13.799 my money and it still wasn't enough
00:30:16.559 yeah I had to spend like twice that
00:30:20.039 again yeah go for that too by the way
00:30:22.799 that that's going to help a lot iate
00:30:24.399 this for real yeah I mean the personal
00:30:26.640 brand thing is just good for like if you
00:30:28.399 have one it's great it helps a lot um
00:30:31.200 but at the end of the day if the if the
00:30:32.720 if the business that you're trying to
00:30:33.960 build solves a real problem and you
00:30:36.279 really genuinely care about the problem
00:30:38.279 if you find someone else who also cares
00:30:39.919 about that problem they will be more
00:30:41.279 likely to work with you like that's
00:30:42.559 fundamentally
00:30:43.760 it what do you sorry last question F
00:30:48.039 what do you think about creating a an
00:30:50.840 offer to train people to do what you are
00:30:54.360 trying to eventually staff for like home
00:30:57.720 GR
00:30:58.559 yeah like you know like in train there
00:31:01.039 was a point there was a point in time I
00:31:02.000 had a closer program I was training
00:31:03.200 closers and I was Staffing them you know
00:31:04.480 what I mean and then I was I stopped
00:31:05.720 doing that because there's so many
00:31:06.480 closure training programs but right now
00:31:07.919 I really need growth Partners people who
00:31:10.159 can lead and manage our clients and kind
00:31:12.519 of oversee everything what do you think
00:31:14.760 about like I know there's a growth
00:31:16.559 operator thing but they're not you know
00:31:18.120 like in my mind like they don't have all
00:31:19.919 the skill sets necessar what if someone
00:31:21.360 you know created a program to train
00:31:23.559 people I don't think you create another
00:31:24.799 business to solve a role okay depends if
00:31:27.639 it's like I know with a software
00:31:30.600 engineer no one's going to be any decent
00:31:33.480 in 10 years maybe a prodigy in six or
00:31:36.120 seven but like there's just no
00:31:38.639 shortcutting that like I mean my
00:31:42.000 co-founder done 20 so the years matter
00:31:46.480 and the same is true with a lot of
00:31:48.600 things like there's just years so like
00:31:51.519 but some other things might be different
00:31:53.080 like setting okay yeah you can teach
00:31:54.799 that closing yeah you can probably teach
00:31:57.240 that but these more high level strategic
00:32:02.200 things yeah that ain't happening like it
00:32:05.080 took me [ __ ] 10 years like so are you
00:32:08.480 going to wait 10 years no yeah it's like
00:32:12.039 fundamentally every skill is trainable
00:32:13.559 the question is whether it's worth the
00:32:14.840 return on effort and the resources to
00:32:16.279 train someone with it if you break
00:32:17.960 things down enough you can train someone
00:32:19.519 to do anything it's just that if someone
00:32:21.880 lack has zero meta skills they don't
00:32:24.000 know how to read they don't know how to
00:32:25.519 write they don't know how to talk you
00:32:26.639 could teach someone to do all that stuff
00:32:28.519 it's just why
00:32:30.840 bother so I'd rather take someone who's
00:32:32.919 already here and then just nudge them if
00:32:34.720 I can with you know proper training that
00:32:36.440 just Bridges the gap between all the
00:32:37.760 skills they come in with and then
00:32:39.120 applying that to my business you got
00:32:41.919 it cool appreciate it yeah worries I
00:32:45.399 mean the people's the reason that most
00:32:46.840 internet marketers in general can't make
00:32:48.840 money sorry they they make money but
00:32:50.919 they don't make like big money is that
00:32:52.679 they just can't they can't they don't
00:32:53.919 know how to operate people and that's
00:32:56.279 usually because they need like a right
00:32:58.039 hand a true right hand who can who's as
00:33:00.200 good as
00:33:01.360 them and like Lea will never get the
00:33:03.600 credit that she deserves and that's fine
00:33:05.760 um but like the reason that all of our
00:33:08.320 stuff is so big is because she's so good
00:33:11.639 at at building like she's an
00:33:14.320 unbelievable Builder and so like the
00:33:16.799 culture of the team is Rock Solid I mean
00:33:18.360 the guys will tell you like Lea really
00:33:19.840 runs the like Laya runs acquisition out
00:33:22.200 like I I really like she really does she
00:33:25.440 does like Lea runs everything like I
00:33:28.159 mean I told you I have an empty calendar
00:33:30.639 I can't have an empty calendar and and
00:33:32.559 also have a business that's running
00:33:33.760 unless someone else is actually doing it
00:33:35.279 Lea had takes 15 meetings a day she
00:33:38.159 operates she's she's coordinating things
00:33:39.799 between different departments she's
00:33:41.080 checking on portfolio company she's
00:33:43.200 having you know one once of people who
00:33:44.760 are having some sort of emotional
00:33:46.080 breakdown about some craziness whatever
00:33:48.799 um she handles all that with the
00:33:51.639 smallart you know what I mean and so but
00:33:53.480 like I I I was we were talking earlier
00:33:56.399 like I ca at $3 million year and then
00:33:58.960 when Lea came in 24 months later I took
00:34:00.559 home 17 million in income net and so the
00:34:04.120 difference was that she liked people and
00:34:07.679 I tried to avoid them and that was the
00:34:11.719 problem and so she her like Lea's
00:34:14.719 genuine Vision in life is to build a
00:34:17.320 company that people love working at
00:34:19.239 that's her whole like the whole reason
00:34:20.639 that she like she gets up like her
00:34:22.079 internal mission is to build a company
00:34:23.679 that people love being at every
00:34:26.320 day and so her vision just fits within
00:34:29.399 my vision and so I recruited her to do
00:34:32.879 it but like if we didn't do stuff that
00:34:34.040 she liked we'd like she wouldn't build
00:34:35.599 it so I very much like especially the
00:34:39.040 more talented the people that you bring
00:34:40.280 on the more you like like they don't
00:34:42.760 need pushing like they know what they're
00:34:45.679 doing you just need to make sure that
00:34:47.679 they're doing it in the direction and
00:34:49.359 you kind of do this yeah the amount of
00:34:51.119 training that you have to give someone
00:34:52.800 is inversely portional to the skills
00:34:54.320 that they come in with so the more
00:34:56.399 basically the the less skill the person
00:34:57.960 the more specific the instructions Sam
00:35:00.400 could basically just be like hey can you
00:35:01.960 just promote school a lot and I'd be
00:35:03.960 like yeah he's not like hey could you
00:35:06.160 make these posts and write this copy and
00:35:08.640 send these emails and run ads and make
00:35:11.680 the hooks like this like that exchange
00:35:14.599 has literally never occurred like I
00:35:17.200 don't even know if Sam sees the ads
00:35:18.520 before before they they go out he takes
00:35:21.520 me the other day he was like when does
00:35:22.960 the activation stuff come out and I said
00:35:24.760 last Thursday
00:35:27.920 no like for real like I already did
00:35:31.480 it and then he was like I've seen this
00:35:33.760 and I was like yeah I've already been
00:35:34.839 thinking about that we've got something
00:35:36.240 coming like we don't even I've already
00:35:38.920 thought about the next four things and
00:35:41.440 we've got things ready so by the time
00:35:43.839 horos has the idea I'm like yeah we got
00:35:45.720 it don't worry do your thing and then
00:35:48.560 I'm like cool let me tell you what what
00:35:49.800 I'm doing on the media side it's like oh
00:35:51.240 [ __ ] great like these are all the things
00:35:53.599 that I'm ramping up this the system
00:35:54.800 we're putting in place like we changed
00:35:55.960 our Cadence like things like that it's
00:35:57.319 like oh doe I don't even want to think
00:35:59.040 about YouTube so like if I had to tell
00:36:02.280 him stuff oh my God
00:36:05.520 like yeah but it's good to divide it
00:36:08.119 like that cuz I can just focus on this
00:36:10.119 stuff he can focus on that stuff Kirby
00:36:12.359 can focus on his stuff we have very good
00:36:15.720 like division like that yeah the amount
00:36:17.960 of Direction you need to give someone is
00:36:19.160 inversely proportional to the skill they
00:36:20.920 have like someone could just be like hey
00:36:22.920 can you build this company and be like
00:36:24.480 sure people will complain like if people
00:36:27.240 it's always a sign of noticed when
00:36:28.760 people complain there's no
00:36:30.839 communication have you has anyone had
00:36:32.960 this as an
00:36:35.359 issue like with teams maybe a lot of you
00:36:37.920 don't have teams yet but bad
00:36:39.240 communication communication sometimes
00:36:41.359 it's always the
00:36:42.760 complaint yeah I found it's interesting
00:36:45.079 that one
00:36:47.000 because you don't really need to
00:36:49.200 communicate a whole lot when you get the
00:36:50.599 right people like mosy said like a
00:36:52.839 couple of words and I was like don't
00:36:53.680 worry I got it like already happened
00:36:56.359 like right
00:36:58.400 but sometimes if you hire the wrong
00:36:59.760 person there's no amount of
00:37:00.880 communication that can ever make it work
00:37:03.839 and it's
00:37:04.839 exhausting and it just still doesn't
00:37:07.119 work and I think I understood this I
00:37:09.720 think I told this at one of the previous
00:37:11.079 ones but how you know what a good
00:37:12.680 culture is is this story of Google in
00:37:16.040 the early days so Larry Page searched
00:37:20.599 for something in the ads that showed up
00:37:22.599 were not relevant to the words he typed
00:37:24.560 in he took a screenshot he printed it
00:37:26.839 off he got a read marker and he wrote
00:37:28.400 These ads suck he walked over to the
00:37:31.480 engineers and he pinned it up on the
00:37:33.359 wall and he tapped it and one of them
00:37:36.640 walked over and picked it Off the Wall
00:37:38.920 stayed up all night that night and
00:37:41.240 invented
00:37:42.640 AdSense which is their which has made
00:37:46.400 them hundreds of
00:37:48.319 billions chill so he didn't sit down
00:37:51.680 with him and be like look I think you
00:37:53.040 need to do this and this and this and
00:37:54.480 maybe this he just said these ads suck
00:37:57.800 right is that clear
00:37:59.800 communication I mean to him it was no
00:38:02.880 but that's what good talent is you can
00:38:04.800 just be like this thing they do this
00:38:08.119 yeah you don't even have to say do this
00:38:10.319 you can say this sucks sort it out like
00:38:13.760 and then they'll they'll be on it or
00:38:15.119 they might have already preempted what
00:38:16.880 sucks cuz they've already been thinking
00:38:18.440 about it so I always remember that when
00:38:21.560 people say oh like you need more
00:38:22.960 meetings or more communication like
00:38:24.640 there wasn't a meeting first of all
00:38:28.000 right there was there was slapping
00:38:29.920 something on the
00:38:31.240 wall yeah one of the most difficult
00:38:33.880 things this is like I think this from an
00:38:35.520 entrepreneurship perspective in terms of
00:38:37.560 development is like has anyone here had
00:38:40.200 another business before this yes okay
00:38:43.560 did you achieve in this business what
00:38:45.680 you achieved in your last business like
00:38:47.319 in like from how long it took you to get
00:38:49.440 to that level in your the business
00:38:50.960 before versus how long it took you to
00:38:52.640 get to that level with this business was
00:38:54.240 it way
00:38:55.319 faster and so a lot of the reasons is
00:38:57.960 because you already beat the bosses up
00:38:59.280 to that level so it's kind of like
00:39:00.280 you're quickly retracing your steps and
00:39:01.720 then you get to a level that you don't
00:39:03.119 to your level of incompetence the
00:39:05.400 difficulty the the thing that takes the
00:39:07.520 longest in entrepreneurship is figuring
00:39:09.480 out what good looks like at each level
00:39:12.599 and it's one of those things it's really
00:39:13.960 hard to translate like you see the
00:39:15.319 billionaires on stage and they're just
00:39:16.680 like I you know get great people and
00:39:19.040 you're like
00:39:20.640 sure but the thing is is that connecting
00:39:23.359 what great people to them looks like in
00:39:25.319 their mind and what you think great
00:39:26.839 people are that is an ocean apart and so
00:39:30.359 I mean I tell this story and Sam when I
00:39:32.000 was talking about this last time but
00:39:33.240 like I when we started meeting with
00:39:35.160 private Equity firms uh to to to look at
00:39:38.280 transacting with gym Lodge I we'd have
00:39:41.040 these super long tables that were these
00:39:42.880 boardrooms and I'd see their team all
00:39:44.960 the way on this side I saw my team all
00:39:46.560 the way on this side and I would just
00:39:48.359 kind of sit there and listen to like the
00:39:50.119 questions that they were asking and the
00:39:51.720 responses that my team had to be fair
00:39:53.359 the team that we had had built $100
00:39:54.760 million plus company preo obviously I
00:39:57.119 saw during Co which actually hurt my
00:39:58.520 valuation but not the point um so they
00:40:01.839 buil a $100 million company which is
00:40:03.240 cool but when I saw the the talent on
00:40:05.880 this side I was like oh that's why these
00:40:07.440 guys are going to make $3 billion over
00:40:09.280 the next five years this team and it was
00:40:12.599 such a stark contrast in terms of the
00:40:14.200 level of talent again not disrespecting
00:40:16.000 my team it was just such a difference
00:40:18.560 that it was literally like after that
00:40:20.200 immediately I was like my whole bar was
00:40:22.680 just reset in terms of the caliber of
00:40:24.720 the people that even existed in the
00:40:27.480 world and everything was like how on
00:40:29.560 Earth do I get those people to work for
00:40:31.839 me and so like right now some of you
00:40:35.440 have like one person who's like man I
00:40:36.800 couldn't live without that person
00:40:38.359 there's somebody who's literally 10
00:40:39.880 times better than that person that
00:40:41.119 exists right now and it's just trying to
00:40:42.960 figure out what you need to do to get
00:40:44.400 them on your team but the problem that
00:40:46.599 takes so long is looking at what good
00:40:49.640 talent in general looks like but even
00:40:51.280 when it gets role specific like Sam had
00:40:52.760 to do all this research to figure out
00:40:54.040 like how do good software Engineers talk
00:40:56.520 like what do they like what do they want
00:40:58.240 and so some of you guys are at a point
00:40:59.359 where you need to like start hiring a
00:41:00.440 sales director or something like that
00:41:02.200 like what happens is like this is the
00:41:03.920 entrepreneur know it looks like you
00:41:05.880 bring someone on you talk to a bunch of
00:41:07.079 people and then you're like I think this
00:41:08.079 guy's good you bring him in and he sucks
00:41:10.440 and that takes six months away from the
00:41:11.920 growth that you would have had because
00:41:12.920 your sales team drops and this guy
00:41:14.200 sucked you put bad processes in then you
00:41:15.839 got to fix the process you got to fire
00:41:17.040 the people that guy hire because he
00:41:18.079 sucked anyways and then you're like
00:41:19.480 shoot I'm going to try again you br the
00:41:21.079 next guy in and then sometimes it
00:41:22.880 happens again and you're like wow this
00:41:24.319 sucked and then the third time and
00:41:26.079 sometimes this takes a year or two years
00:41:27.760 and then you're like I now know and you
00:41:30.040 get lucky and you get one who actually
00:41:31.880 works and you're like oh this is what a
00:41:33.920 great sales director looks like and so
00:41:35.599 the next time you go through your
00:41:36.520 entrepreneur Journey you're like you go
00:41:38.160 right to there and then you're like
00:41:39.119 shoot I don't know what a good customer
00:41:40.319 success person looks like and then you
00:41:41.640 try again and so it's like however
00:41:43.480 quickly you can work through that so you
00:41:44.880 can start recognizing the pattern of a
00:41:46.680 what good looks like in general and then
00:41:48.079 B what it what good looks like for a
00:41:49.880 specific role that's how quickly you
00:41:52.319 move through the levels that's been my
00:41:54.839 experience with this and I wish I try
00:41:56.480 and do everything I can to try and
00:41:57.560 translate that into the stories that I
00:41:58.720 tell with the content but sometime it's
00:42:00.800 really tough because people like nod but
00:42:03.680 like that is that is the secret sauce
00:42:06.040 like that is it is being able to
00:42:07.119 recognize like what a good growth
00:42:09.040 partner looks like what a good even a
00:42:11.240 good agency I've have good I have good
00:42:12.680 agencies that we work with now vast
00:42:14.599 majority of them 95% of them are dog
00:42:17.280 [ __ ] some of you guys run
00:42:21.920 them so like that's that's that's that's
00:42:24.599 the pattern recognition that's the
00:42:25.920 highest value thing that you end up
00:42:27.160 learning as an entrepreneur is what what
00:42:29.000 good looks like
