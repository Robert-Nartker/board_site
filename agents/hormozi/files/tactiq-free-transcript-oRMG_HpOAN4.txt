# https://www.youtube.com/watch/oRMG_HpOAN4

00:00:00.040 I've been in business 13 years I've sold
00:00:01.839 nine companies my last company I sold
00:00:03.800 for $ 46.2 million my current portfolio
00:00:06.120 at acis.com just over $17 million a
00:00:08.800 month and I'm going to compress 13 years
00:00:10.719 of business advice into this one video
00:00:12.519 number one have something extremely
00:00:15.320 expensive to sell that you never even
00:00:17.400 plan on selling I learned about this
00:00:20.320 anchoring tactic from a friend of mine
00:00:23.640 and he said listen man you can just put
00:00:25.640 something on your menu of items or
00:00:27.439 services that you sell that's 10 or 100
00:00:30.359 times more expensive and just by having
00:00:32.880 it there it'll anchor everything else on
00:00:35.000 your menu or the rest of the prices that
00:00:36.879 you have and just make it something that
00:00:39.680 if someone actually bought it you'd be
00:00:41.399 stoked that they did but what ends up
00:00:43.760 happening is that one you'll sell more
00:00:46.480 people on your core offer because they
00:00:48.680 have this big price anchor second it
00:00:50.879 allows you to nudge up your main offer's
00:00:53.440 price because related to the big one it
00:00:55.399 looks like almost nothing I was talking
00:00:57.160 to a different friend of mine and I said
00:00:58.680 hey you know you should consider just
00:01:00.320 adding one of these things in and he had
00:01:01.760 a weight loss business a very generic
00:01:03.519 online weight loss business and so he
00:01:05.159 added uh a six times higher price
00:01:08.880 version of his offer and then the
00:01:11.159 craziest thing happened people started
00:01:13.200 buying that more than his core offer and
00:01:16.080 when he did that he tripled his profit
00:01:19.479 overnight and so the thing is is that it
00:01:22.280 also breaks you especially if you're
00:01:24.280 starting in business out of this fear of
00:01:26.640 raising prices by just saying hey
00:01:28.560 there's no there's no way anyone's going
00:01:30.520 to buy this I'm going to make this so
00:01:31.840 expensive no one's going to buy it and
00:01:33.560 that's okay so you give yourself
00:01:35.000 permission to just fly it out there but
00:01:37.520 what you will find is that 10% of
00:01:39.640 customers just want to buy the most
00:01:41.280 expensive thing these are the whales and
00:01:43.640 the only thing worse than making a
00:01:44.799 $1,000 offer to somebody with a $100
00:01:46.960 budget is making a $100 offer to someone
00:01:50.079 with a $1,000 budget because in the
00:01:51.799 first scenario you lose a 100 bucks in
00:01:53.640 the second scenario you lose $900 of the
00:01:56.280 money that you should have made but
00:01:57.479 didn't number two no one knows knows you
00:02:00.399 exist advertise more and so to give you
00:02:03.439 context on this when I walk through the
00:02:06.280 streets I usually get stopped four or
00:02:08.239 five times on like a 60-minute walk and
00:02:11.560 when I was launching my book last year I
00:02:14.680 had you know 500,000 plus people who
00:02:16.720 were registered it was this massive
00:02:17.959 event broke the internet whatever but
00:02:20.560 during the month leading up to it we're
00:02:22.040 advertising on all channels we're
00:02:23.319 running ads we've got Affiliates that
00:02:25.080 are pumping it I'm making content all
00:02:26.680 over the place and over the 4 weeks of
00:02:30.360 people that stopped me only one person
00:02:33.560 knew that I had a book coming out and so
00:02:36.519 every time I'd see somebody like hey you
00:02:37.720 going to be at the book launch and
00:02:38.560 they're like oh you have a book and I
00:02:40.280 was like how can you not know that I
00:02:42.000 have a book there's a story from Henry
00:02:43.519 Ford that I love which is that he was
00:02:46.000 walking by his the CMO of Ford was right
00:02:48.640 next to his office and every day he'd
00:02:50.720 walk by and he'd see the marketing
00:02:52.120 campaign he he'd see the marketing
00:02:53.440 campaign a day after day after day and
00:02:54.680 so 3 months into seeing the same
00:02:56.480 campaign he knocked on a CMOS door and
00:02:58.159 he's like hey when are we going to stop
00:02:59.920 running this thing he's like I'm getting
00:03:01.080 exhausted of seeing it and the guy just
00:03:02.840 looked at me he's like we haven't
00:03:04.120 started running it yet and so the thing
00:03:06.000 is is that we get so sick of our
00:03:07.440 advertising so much before our customers
00:03:10.640 or potential customers even remember our
00:03:12.599 names and so the extent of advertising
00:03:15.680 that you have to do there are so many
00:03:17.920 people in the world and people's
00:03:19.400 attention is so spread thin and so
00:03:21.680 they're so distracted that in the off
00:03:23.920 chance you actually do get an
00:03:25.120 advertisement of some sort in front of
00:03:26.959 them the likel that they remember that
00:03:28.879 it was even you and the core message of
00:03:30.799 that advertising is even lower and so
00:03:32.480 many of us have this big fear that we're
00:03:35.159 harassing our Audience by repeating
00:03:37.239 ourselves over and over and over again
00:03:39.280 but the vast majority of the time no one
00:03:41.200 even a knows you exist or B specifically
00:03:43.519 knows the message that you're trying to
00:03:44.760 let them know and so I like to tell my
00:03:47.519 team and remind myself that we need to
00:03:49.319 be reminded more than we need to be
00:03:50.560 taught and so your audience needs to be
00:03:52.400 reminded more than they need to be
00:03:53.640 taught and I don't know about you but I
00:03:54.879 followed plenty of accounts where like
00:03:56.319 they have the same four or five messages
00:03:58.000 more or less that they put out there and
00:03:59.480 the reason I follow them is because I
00:04:00.879 like the reminder I like to be reminded
00:04:02.519 to be patient I like to be reminded to
00:04:04.360 to to not think take things too
00:04:05.760 seriously I like to be reminded that I
00:04:07.599 have to think long like those are the
00:04:08.879 things that I like to be reminded of and
00:04:10.120 so imagine if that accounts like I
00:04:11.519 already said be patient once I don't
00:04:12.959 want to say it again they've already
00:04:14.519 heard that from me it's like no people
00:04:16.358 have messages that they want to continue
00:04:17.759 to get fed into and every time you feed
00:04:19.839 that same message that they likeed
00:04:21.079 before back into them they'll have
00:04:22.520 another positive experience with you the
00:04:24.600 amount of novelty that's required in
00:04:26.199 content is significantly less than you
00:04:28.280 think as a creator think about it like
00:04:30.560 you're going after a girl and she's with
00:04:33.560 somebody right now all right so you're
00:04:35.440 like okay well I'm going to ease off but
00:04:36.919 I'm just going to just let let them know
00:04:38.360 I'm just going to throw these little
00:04:39.240 flares out there that I'm that I'm I'm
00:04:40.919 interested I'm here I'm not being
00:04:42.080 disrespectful but I'm I'm available
00:04:43.800 right and then what happens is as soon
00:04:45.400 as uh she gets out of that relationship
00:04:47.840 or whatever then she's receptive to your
00:04:50.240 message and so the thing is same way
00:04:51.880 works with customers is that they might
00:04:53.120 not be looking for a marketing solution
00:04:54.720 they may not be looking for a plumbing
00:04:56.120 solution they might not be looking for
00:04:58.199 an IT services provider for 3 months 6
00:05:01.400 months 9 months but they might like to
00:05:03.639 hear your stuff but the moment they are
00:05:05.639 in the market you're the first one they
00:05:07.120 think of because you continued to repeat
00:05:09.160 the messages that resonated with them to
00:05:11.520 begin with the big thing is the 4x4 all
00:05:14.320 right which is especially when you're
00:05:16.199 starting out four hours a day doing the
00:05:19.240 core four and so the core four means
00:05:20.919 you're reaching out to people you know
00:05:21.960 oneon-one reaching out to strangers
00:05:23.440 one-onone making content one to many or
00:05:26.759 running ads one to many and so there's
00:05:28.840 the four ways the only things one person
00:05:30.600 can do to let other people know about
00:05:31.960 their stuff and so I use the rule of 100
00:05:34.240 as my my guide there which means you
00:05:35.960 either make a 100 minutes of content you
00:05:38.080 do a 100 outreaches so either cold or
00:05:39.960 warm or or and if you want to get really
00:05:43.120 spicy or at least $100 a day of
00:05:45.759 advertising now obviously the $100 a day
00:05:47.520 you can scale as much as you want but as
00:05:48.960 a baseline for anybody who's starting a
00:05:50.560 business those are three ways that you
00:05:52.919 can just say okay what do I have to do
00:05:54.880 to let more people know about my stuff
00:05:56.520 if you're not making 100 minutes of
00:05:57.880 content you're not doing 100 outreaches
00:05:59.440 a day day or you're not spending $100 a
00:06:00.919 day on ads no one's going to know you
00:06:02.440 exist and that is the biggest threat to
00:06:04.120 your business the reason it's so
00:06:05.479 important as a Founder to do this in the
00:06:07.599 business is that you have to be able to
00:06:09.400 make it rain and so every business at
00:06:12.520 the most basic level has to advertise
00:06:15.080 before it can have money right so like
00:06:18.080 if you want to make money people cannot
00:06:19.960 give you money until they know you exist
00:06:22.039 and so is a is a pre-requisite for
00:06:24.599 making money in business is that you
00:06:26.120 advertise first and then you have a
00:06:27.639 product that you can deliver on and
00:06:29.120 that's the most basic form that you have
00:06:30.639 to have if you just have the product
00:06:32.120 that no one finds out you will continue
00:06:33.599 to not make money which leads me to
00:06:35.160 number three until you're at $100,000 a
00:06:37.840 month advertising is all of your focus
00:06:41.199 and the main reason for that is if you
00:06:43.039 don't have enough people coming in
00:06:44.319 you're not going to have enough
00:06:45.120 iterations of the product to get
00:06:46.599 feedback to know if your stuff's good or
00:06:48.240 not and what you need to do to make it
00:06:49.599 better now the thing is is that up to
00:06:51.919 $100,000 a month at that point it's all
00:06:53.960 advertising but at some point in order
00:06:55.919 to continue to scale you need to fix the
00:06:58.039 product you need to make sure that
00:06:59.000 people are refg you need people make
00:07:00.479 sure people are happy that they're
00:07:01.800 referring other people that they're
00:07:03.280 staying month after month or they're
00:07:04.360 repurchasing month after month after
00:07:05.759 month and so if you're not solving that
00:07:08.000 then you've got a leaky bucket and
00:07:09.360 that's going to be a problem that you're
00:07:10.160 going to deal with later and so the
00:07:11.360 smart move is to fix that stuff now so
00:07:14.039 that you can grow a really big business
00:07:15.599 and this is one of the biggest mistakes
00:07:17.400 that I made so many times in my early
00:07:18.960 career is that you start advertising you
00:07:20.520 start understanding a sell and acquire
00:07:22.160 customers and you say oh that worked
00:07:24.120 I'll do more of it and you should do
00:07:25.960 more of it but within this current
00:07:27.919 context of you have to make sure that
00:07:30.000 you're delivering and so my
00:07:31.520 recommendation is get to a million doll
00:07:33.039 so get to $100,000 a month is then put
00:07:35.599 all of your focus on filling all the
00:07:37.319 holes in the bucket so that and the
00:07:39.160 thing is is when you do that you're
00:07:40.479 actually going to keep growing because
00:07:41.319 if you keep the same activities and then
00:07:42.840 you fix the holes you're still going to
00:07:44.400 keep growing steadily month after month
00:07:46.159 after month even with the same level of
00:07:47.599 advertising effort then once you fix the
00:07:50.319 holes then you go back to the front end
00:07:52.159 and say how do I 10x this and that is
00:07:54.199 how you can stair step even though your
00:07:56.080 actual Revenue growth will still look
00:07:57.759 flat because when you fix the holes
00:07:59.080 you'll make more money but the doing
00:08:01.800 this of the business will shift now if
00:08:03.520 you do the alternative of that which is
00:08:05.240 you just advertise more and more and
00:08:06.639 more there's going to get to a point
00:08:08.039 it's an ASM toote so basically you start
00:08:09.400 growing and you start plateauing like
00:08:11.039 this because then your infrastructure is
00:08:13.560 too big and there's too many moving
00:08:15.080 pieces to fix the thing that you should
00:08:16.520 have fixed earlier but then you're in a
00:08:18.159 rock and a hard play scenario because
00:08:19.639 then you can't B dial back the
00:08:21.440 advertising because you got all these
00:08:22.560 people that you've hired but the more
00:08:24.840 you sell the more your reputation goes
00:08:26.319 in the tank because the stuff's not good
00:08:27.879 and so you get a really hard scenario
00:08:29.639 and so fixing it first fixing it early
00:08:32.320 sets you up to build a much bigger
00:08:34.240 business later number four under a
00:08:36.799 million dollars a year it's one channel
00:08:39.599 one Avatar one product I see way too
00:08:41.719 many small business owners saying hey
00:08:43.479 I've got two businesses or I have seven
00:08:45.040 products or have two different avatars
00:08:46.320 or blah blah blah blah right no focus on
00:08:48.920 one specific type of customer and if you
00:08:50.680 s if you just say yes to everyone with
00:08:52.080 money you basically saying no to your
00:08:54.000 business because you're never going to
00:08:54.800 be able to focus and make something
00:08:55.800 really good you can't serve six
00:08:56.959 customers and then make a good product
00:08:58.399 only doing $100,000 a month it just
00:08:59.760 doesn't like it's it's too small volume
00:09:01.480 like you don't get enough reps and so
00:09:03.240 you need to do one very specific thing
00:09:05.040 which means you have to say no to people
00:09:06.279 who aren't that that type of person you
00:09:07.839 serve one problem which means you have
00:09:09.920 one product for that specific Avatar and
00:09:11.839 you get better and better at templatized
00:09:13.279 at at productizing the service or
00:09:15.600 product whatever the product is itself
00:09:17.000 making iterations on it and you
00:09:18.600 advertise through one channel meaning
00:09:20.600 you just know how to make cold email
00:09:21.880 convert or you just know how to make
00:09:22.959 cold calls convert or you just know how
00:09:24.240 to make uh Tik Tok ads convert or you
00:09:26.399 just know how to make YouTube videos
00:09:28.000 that convert whatever your channel is
00:09:29.680 you just stick with that channel because
00:09:31.160 as soon as you're like oh I'm going to
00:09:32.079 do two different things like that's not
00:09:33.440 the objective of this stage you just
00:09:35.519 need to get it reliable so that that you
00:09:37.760 can then keep tweaking the product so
00:09:39.760 that then you can 10x the existing
00:09:41.800 Channel you're on once you get to about
00:09:43.360 a million a month is when I recommend
00:09:45.000 starting to to think about second and
00:09:47.000 tertiary channels of getting customers
00:09:48.560 and part of the reason I recommend that
00:09:49.880 is that when you start a second channel
00:09:51.680 it's going to cost you money and it's
00:09:53.120 going to cost you time and so the reason
00:09:55.560 that you keep that one channel and keep
00:09:57.320 doing it longer than you think is
00:09:58.760 because you need to be able to get it
00:10:00.200 working at the same level or higher with
00:10:02.160 not you doing it so that you can have
00:10:04.600 the secondary Channel if you're the one
00:10:06.399 who's gassing this first channel and
00:10:08.560 then you move to the second well now you
00:10:10.920 have this second one that's not going to
00:10:12.360 be working out nearly as efficiently as
00:10:13.880 the first one especially in the
00:10:14.880 beginning the first 3 months 6 months
00:10:16.880 it's not going to be cranking like the
00:10:18.200 first one is but the first one's also
00:10:20.120 going to go down because you're not
00:10:21.279 there and so you spend the extra time
00:10:23.480 there you put the right people in place
00:10:25.600 you make sure the training is such that
00:10:28.040 they actually can meet or exceed what
00:10:30.560 you were doing on your own and then when
00:10:32.480 you start the second Channel you can
00:10:33.640 pour resources into it because you still
00:10:35.399 have cash flow from your main thing and
00:10:37.360 that little switch is where most people
00:10:38.839 get lost and they just Crush their
00:10:40.519 businesses so don't do that so to give
00:10:42.600 you guys some context I didn't open up a
00:10:44.760 second channel of acquisition until we
00:10:46.480 were at 4 million a month now mind you I
00:10:48.560 started with paid ads because I was good
00:10:50.040 at paid ads and I learned how to run
00:10:52.440 paid ads in my local business which then
00:10:54.120 when I went National I KN had to do the
00:10:56.120 same skill set but after 4 million a
00:10:58.959 month I was like okay I need to get this
00:11:01.160 second Channel going and so I started
00:11:02.920 increasing that channel via cold email
00:11:06.399 cold call cold DMS with an outbound team
00:11:09.240 but I say that because a lot of people
00:11:10.680 are like shouldn't I do this I try to
00:11:12.639 delay that as long as I possibly can
00:11:14.639 because I know it's going to cost a huge
00:11:15.959 amount of time a huge amount of money
00:11:17.680 and it might not work for 6 to 12 months
00:11:19.519 and to give you context it took me 12
00:11:21.279 months for outbound to be responsible
00:11:24.360 for half of my Revenue so it's not going
00:11:26.440 to happen overnight number five always
00:11:29.320 start for free always and I know and I I
00:11:32.079 don't usually use explicit 100% black
00:11:35.560 and white language but I have yet to see
00:11:38.360 a time where starting for free has not
00:11:40.480 made me more money so let me explain so
00:11:43.160 when I started my Fitness business way
00:11:45.600 back when I started with free I wanted
00:11:48.040 to get people results and I said I don't
00:11:50.160 have any experience so please let me
00:11:52.560 just train you for free and because of
00:11:54.560 that I have lower Stakes because they
00:11:56.279 didn't pay me money they're still paying
00:11:57.880 in other ways they're still paying time
00:11:59.240 time they're paying inconvenience all
00:12:00.760 the other things that a customer has to
00:12:01.800 do those costs are still there by the
00:12:03.760 way those hidden costs are the things
00:12:05.200 that you want to decrease as much as you
00:12:06.560 can in your product so that you can
00:12:08.760 charge more money because you'll find
00:12:10.079 over time that the most expensive thing
00:12:12.480 about your product often isn't the price
00:12:15.360 it's everything else you require a
00:12:16.800 customer to do as a result of the
00:12:18.240 purchase which is what things do they
00:12:19.720 have to give up that they like doing as
00:12:21.360 a result of the purchase and what is
00:12:23.000 what are the things that they have to
00:12:23.920 start doing that they hate doing as a
00:12:25.600 result of the purchase and this happens
00:12:27.160 with everything and when I say like and
00:12:28.600 hate I use those as extremes but
00:12:30.240 fundamentally there's some sort of
00:12:31.240 friction there's some sort of
00:12:32.120 inconvenience like when I buy a car I
00:12:34.199 have to now get gas that is now an
00:12:35.680 inconvenience in my life now compared to
00:12:37.839 all the other cars maybe all cars that
00:12:39.680 have that inconvenience until they have
00:12:41.279 an electric car and all of a sudden that
00:12:42.880 inconvenience has been removed because I
00:12:44.600 can plug the car in at night so I'm a
00:12:45.920 co-owner of school.com and I talk to
00:12:49.920 beginner entrepreneurs a lot and so I
00:12:53.440 see this happening more often than not
00:12:55.920 which is that they say hey no one wants
00:12:57.920 to buy my thing and I say okay well
00:12:59.800 where's your where are your testimonials
00:13:01.760 where are the people that you've used
00:13:03.240 before this that you've helped get the
00:13:04.519 result and they're like well I don't
00:13:05.639 have any I'm like well why would I
00:13:07.199 believe you they're like well I have
00:13:08.839 this amazing offer and I'm going to talk
00:13:10.360 about this in number six at length but
00:13:14.079 if you don't start for free why should
00:13:16.000 anyone believe you and if you are doing
00:13:18.320 this for the first time why would you
00:13:20.000 want to take money for something that
00:13:21.240 you don't even know if it's good yet and
00:13:23.199 so this can both give you the conviction
00:13:25.440 and give you the confidence to get going
00:13:26.920 because you actually have some results
00:13:28.320 that you can go off of you can use those
00:13:30.040 results to Market to get more customers
00:13:31.720 I do this at every level of business and
00:13:34.000 so everything that I do I always start
00:13:36.880 with free no matter what it is and
00:13:39.639 whether it's a new product line in a
00:13:40.880 massive company one of our portfolio
00:13:42.320 companies we built out a software
00:13:43.519 product uh for the existing service base
00:13:45.920 and so we said hey we can now have a DIY
00:13:48.920 version of our services that you can use
00:13:50.880 with this software product and what did
00:13:52.839 we do we started for free we took our
00:13:54.399 top 100 customers and said hey why don't
00:13:56.000 you try it out let us know get us
00:13:57.399 feedback and they just kept giving us
00:13:58.800 feedback back and honestly in the
00:14:00.160 beginning the fact that some people want
00:14:01.720 to charge for this is insane it's like
00:14:03.440 they're giving me so much valuable stuff
00:14:05.880 I'm just happy that they use it right
00:14:08.079 and so you go with free and then you go
00:14:10.519 with a small small amount of money and
00:14:12.880 then you keep raising your prices over
00:14:14.240 time which I'll get to in a second and
00:14:15.600 for those of you who are worried about
00:14:16.680 your pocketbook like I'm Froning all
00:14:18.519 these costs well yeah that's why it's
00:14:19.800 called investing in a business but
00:14:22.040 people who you work with for free can
00:14:24.000 make you money in three ways number one
00:14:25.639 is they can leave you a testimonial
00:14:27.000 number two is they can refer you other
00:14:28.680 customers via Word of Mouth that you did
00:14:30.360 a good job and number three they can
00:14:32.720 actually stay on and pay after a certain
00:14:35.160 period of time when you do make it not
00:14:36.759 free and you make it uh for money
00:14:39.360 because if you want to keep surfacing
00:14:41.759 and this is ideally how it works out is
00:14:43.399 that you do such a good job that they're
00:14:44.839 like I don't want this to stop and then
00:14:46.320 you say great now you can do it in
00:14:47.639 exchange for money because I can't do
00:14:49.519 this anymore in exchange for nothing
00:14:51.759 because I have enough demand because
00:14:53.320 I've done a good job that I have these
00:14:54.720 referrals and I have this proof that
00:14:56.040 people do want to pay me for my services
00:14:57.480 so if You' like that too you can get get
00:14:59.199 the same price they have number six and
00:15:00.920 this is a big one proof over promise so
00:15:05.399 what a lot of beginners do and they read
00:15:06.920 you know $100 million offers and they're
00:15:08.240 like I have a grand slame offer and so
00:15:09.920 because of that I've got this big thing
00:15:12.000 with all these bonuses and the stack and
00:15:13.839 these guarantees and I've got a premium
00:15:15.600 price and yet no one's buying it so what
00:15:17.920 I want to do is walk you through a
00:15:19.000 hypothetical let's say on one extreme
00:15:21.480 we've got somebody who has an amazing
00:15:23.480 crazy awesome offer for whatever they
00:15:25.560 promise you the world and Beyond on this
00:15:29.000 stream same core product or core Service
00:15:32.560 as the first guy except he has no crazy
00:15:35.480 offer he just has 1,000
00:15:37.680 testimonials who is going to get the
00:15:40.199 most customers this guy and so your
00:15:43.839 proof is going to do more selling than
00:15:46.040 any promise can possibly do because the
00:15:48.560 promises all function as an
00:15:50.440 approximation of the likelihood that
00:15:52.480 they're going to get a result and proof
00:15:54.399 is always going to be more compelling
00:15:56.560 and so when you're starting out you want
00:15:58.680 to capture as much proof as humanely
00:16:01.000 possible now I have a huge amount of
00:16:02.560 stuff on proof because I I'm obsessed
00:16:04.720 with it but I'll give you four very good
00:16:07.680 things that you can do to make your
00:16:08.800 proof more compelling number one recent
00:16:11.360 proof is better than delayed proof so if
00:16:14.240 proof was 5 years old proof that's from
00:16:16.440 last week is going to be more compelling
00:16:18.440 second is you want it to be as visual as
00:16:20.160 possible so just a bunch of words on a
00:16:22.319 screen is less compelling than a
00:16:24.160 screenshot of someone's bank account
00:16:25.440 after they made money or someone saying
00:16:28.040 hey I lost 20 pound is not as compelling
00:16:30.199 as the picture of them losing 20 lbs
00:16:32.399 which is also less compelling than a
00:16:34.160 video of them weighing in and then a
00:16:36.480 video of them weighing out the third
00:16:38.399 component for proof that I'll give you
00:16:39.759 is you want high volume and the nice
00:16:41.720 thing is that most businesses actually
00:16:43.519 have a lot more proof than they know
00:16:44.880 they do they just never capture it and
00:16:46.839 so one of the things that I did in our
00:16:48.040 brick and mortar chains that we had with
00:16:49.560 all of the the gyms I do across all our
00:16:51.160 brick and mortars is if you look at Yelp
00:16:53.759 you look at Google you look at Facebook
00:16:55.680 all of these have reviews for your
00:16:57.399 business and so for me and if you're
00:16:59.800 digital then you have Facebook reviews
00:17:01.480 on your Facebook page and things like
00:17:02.920 that and so I would go into the Stars
00:17:05.160 you click into it and there's like a
00:17:06.439 hundred of them and then you just
00:17:07.959 screenshot each one of them so if you
00:17:10.000 have hundred five star reviews on Yelp
00:17:12.039 that's like a mediocre Yelp account
00:17:14.280 right but if I screenshot a hundred of
00:17:16.280 those and then I frame them and I put
00:17:18.039 them on my Lobby wall from floor to
00:17:19.559 ceiling it's overwhelming the amount of
00:17:21.799 proof that is and so most businesses
00:17:23.880 have way more proof than they think they
00:17:25.319 do they just don't leverage it and so
00:17:27.319 one of the easiest things you can do
00:17:29.320 take the screenshots of all all review
00:17:31.600 sites across all platforms show them
00:17:33.720 individually and show them as your new
00:17:35.960 wallpaper and the fourth element of
00:17:37.480 proof is that you want to capture pain
00:17:39.480 and so let me explain by this so I've
00:17:41.320 been able to look at a zillion ads
00:17:43.200 across all companies where they have
00:17:44.600 testimonial ads from customers or user
00:17:46.679 generated content to be fancy right the
00:17:49.200 thing is is the content that begins with
00:17:52.400 pain converts significantly higher and
00:17:55.480 so this is my theory around this which
00:17:57.440 is that the pain relates to the customer
00:18:00.919 or Prospect where they're currently at
00:18:02.919 if they start with the promise it's too
00:18:04.760 far disconnected but if you start with
00:18:07.200 pain they relate to the person and then
00:18:09.039 you can take them through the story of
00:18:10.799 them getting the result but if you start
00:18:12.760 with the end result it's too disjoint
00:18:14.559 it's too far away it becomes less
00:18:15.880 believable so if you had to pick between
00:18:18.120 proof or promise double down on proof
00:18:20.760 and that's also the reason that I tell
00:18:22.240 everyone to start with giving stuff away
00:18:23.799 for free because it's the easiest and
00:18:25.520 fastest way to get tons of it best time
00:18:27.640 to ask someone for a testimonial at the
00:18:29.200 moment of greatest satisfaction all
00:18:30.919 right so that's also by the way
00:18:32.840 different from the best time to sell all
00:18:34.919 right because you want to sell at the
00:18:36.200 moment of greatest pain you want to get
00:18:37.919 a testimoni at the moment of greatest
00:18:39.559 satisfaction so think about this way if
00:18:41.760 I were to say hey uh you have a steak
00:18:43.760 dinner and you have a steak and you're
00:18:45.400 starving you're like oh this is great
00:18:46.640 blah blah blah blah the moment to sell
00:18:47.919 you the steak is right before you've had
00:18:49.240 the steak and then you eat the steak now
00:18:51.120 after you have the steak is that the
00:18:52.480 moment that I say would you like another
00:18:53.720 steak not really because you're like I'm
00:18:55.760 full I'm good so that's the point of
00:18:57.159 greatest satisfaction not the point of
00:18:58.960 greatest deprivation now after I've had
00:19:00.760 the steak if I say hey would you mind
00:19:02.559 like looking in the camera and saying
00:19:03.720 how great the Stak was people like oh my
00:19:05.039 God it was amazing it was so great you
00:19:06.440 guys should definitely check this place
00:19:07.440 out it's awesome right and so point of
00:19:10.200 greatest deprivation is when you make
00:19:11.720 your sale point of greatest satisfaction
00:19:13.799 is when you collect your proof number
00:19:15.200 seven raising prices almost always makes
00:19:18.000 you more money but you hear no more
00:19:20.240 often and so let me break this down so I
00:19:22.440 had a a sales guy in one of our
00:19:24.320 portfolio companies and we doubled the
00:19:27.000 price of a product so a lot of people
00:19:28.760 are like really afraid of like 10% or
00:19:30.799 20% increases like I'll test 4X 5x price
00:19:34.480 differences pricing in many instances is
00:19:37.080 far more inelastic than you think it is
00:19:39.840 all right so elastic versus inelastic
00:19:41.440 pricing I'm not getting into that but
00:19:42.760 basically if you have a $5 sandwich
00:19:44.760 going to $10 sandwich there's a lot of
00:19:46.360 elasticity with food meaning people are
00:19:48.480 very responsive to small increases in
00:19:50.240 price the classic counter example is if
00:19:52.720 you have life saving medication it's not
00:19:55.360 very elastic at all meaning if you
00:19:57.000 double the price people still going to
00:19:58.440 pay for it because they need to live
00:20:00.320 right and so the thing is is that if you
00:20:01.559 have a very bable thing the price is
00:20:03.799 usually a lot a lot more flexible than
00:20:05.919 you think it is in terms of how much you
00:20:07.400 can move it up all right and so I like
00:20:10.120 making massive price tests but the thing
00:20:13.760 that you have to have when you do this
00:20:15.480 is the balls or the stomach to deal with
00:20:18.360 more nose and so when I walked that
00:20:20.880 sales team through the price increase I
00:20:23.520 said hey we're going to double the price
00:20:25.280 I said you have to understand that we're
00:20:27.520 for sure going to get less or fewer
00:20:30.240 yeses but the question is will we get
00:20:32.880 half the yeses so we had a 35% reduction
00:20:37.720 in conversion percentage but we doubled
00:20:40.159 the price and so we made more money in
00:20:43.080 multiple ways so one we made more
00:20:45.520 absolute Revenue we literally just made
00:20:47.120 more Topline but the magic of this is
00:20:49.600 that let's say the cost of our thing was
00:20:51.000 $500 and we sold the thing for $1,000
00:20:54.200 okay so we have 50% margins well if we
00:20:56.440 double the price we go from making $500
00:20:58.559 $ in profit to $1,500 in profit so I
00:21:01.440 actually triple the amount of money I
00:21:03.200 make by doubling my price and so even if
00:21:06.200 I have a 35% reduction or a onethird
00:21:08.720 reduction in sales I tripled how much
00:21:11.840 money I made on the other 2/3 of my
00:21:13.799 sales which means me doubling the price
00:21:17.120 with a one-third reduction in sales
00:21:19.400 still doubled the profit in absolute
00:21:21.640 amounts despite selling onethird fewer
00:21:23.840 customers and one of the nice benefits
00:21:26.240 of having fewer customers is that you
00:21:29.120 have fewer costs associated with
00:21:30.799 delivering on them so not only is the
00:21:33.080 gross margin per customer higher your
00:21:36.120 fixed cost that you have to incur to
00:21:38.400 continue to expand your infrastructure
00:21:40.360 go down and fundamentally a smaller
00:21:43.240 amount of customers that make more money
00:21:45.000 is an easier business to run than more
00:21:47.080 customers that make you less money and
00:21:48.679 let me tell you how important this is
00:21:50.080 I've seen businesses that have not
00:21:51.360 changed their prices for five six seven
00:21:53.159 years right because they're afraid to do
00:21:54.520 it whatever but I want to give you some
00:21:56.679 real hard truth right now
00:21:59.240 in 2017 if you sold something for $100
00:22:01.960 that was your only product and you were
00:22:03.400 running 20% margins as a business if you
00:22:06.120 did not change your price from 2017
00:22:07.799 until 2024 that $100 now means that your
00:22:11.679 costs in that business have gone up by
00:22:13.120 20% which means that your profit is now
00:22:15.039 zero and so if you feel like your
00:22:17.320 margins continue to compress year after
00:22:19.279 year after year it's usually because
00:22:21.000 you're not appropriately adjusting your
00:22:23.200 prices so to give you context
00:22:26.360 $79 in 2017 is the equivalent of $100
00:22:30.279 today and so that would be like you
00:22:32.440 going back in time where you had a 20%
00:22:34.360 margin business and running it at a $79
00:22:37.039 price point rather than a $100 price
00:22:38.880 point and so you just like that
00:22:40.440 eliminate all the profit in the business
00:22:42.480 and so you have to do the reverse of
00:22:43.880 that because inflation is a compounding
00:22:46.960 threat to your business that every year
00:22:49.279 stacks on top of itself and so if you're
00:22:51.279 not making three 6% increases in prices
00:22:54.840 at least annually you're not even
00:22:56.440 keeping up with inflation and to give
00:22:58.200 you little story around this Warren
00:23:00.279 Buffett when he bought C candies said
00:23:02.279 that he only wanted to control one thing
00:23:04.600 and so what that one thing was is that
00:23:06.480 every year he would look at all the
00:23:07.720 prices of all the candies and he would
00:23:09.279 ship them the new pricing and he has
00:23:11.600 raised prices 50 years in a row
00:23:15.000 sometimes in a single year as high as
00:23:17.120 177% onto their pricing and as a result
00:23:19.840 of that he's cleared himself a billion
00:23:21.799 dollars in profit and so if it was the
00:23:23.919 one thing that he focused so hard on it
00:23:26.320 might be something worth thinking about
00:23:28.000 so if you do make a pricing change
00:23:29.799 there's two components to this one is
00:23:31.720 new customers the other is old customers
00:23:34.039 the easiest thing to do is just change
00:23:35.400 the price and and just apply it to
00:23:36.840 everyone who's new that's simple and if
00:23:38.360 you're in a transactional business then
00:23:39.799 it's fine even because the old customers
00:23:42.159 come back and buy again right but if
00:23:43.880 someone's on some sort of recurring
00:23:45.240 service is a little bit trickier now I
00:23:47.840 have some tactics around this but I'll
00:23:49.559 just give you the high levels which is
00:23:51.320 you want to have a price increase letter
00:23:53.000 you want to talk about all the things
00:23:54.159 that they're going to get as as a result
00:23:55.960 of the investment that you're now making
00:23:57.520 into the business and that it's the only
00:23:59.120 way that you'll be able to stay in
00:24:00.159 business given inflationary pressures
00:24:02.279 Etc all right and so you just want to
00:24:04.080 say here's the thing here's the stuff
00:24:06.240 you're going to get I want to keep my
00:24:07.799 promise to you which is to keep our
00:24:09.039 thing as good as possible and only way
00:24:10.559 for me to ethically keep my promise is
00:24:12.360 for us to reflect that in the prices
00:24:14.080 which are now having to be changed
00:24:15.960 effective this date but don't worry I've
00:24:18.919 grandfathered you in to your old price
00:24:21.360 by this time and that's key is that the
00:24:23.159 old customers you say I've Grand
00:24:24.640 everyone wants to be grandfathered you
00:24:25.960 say so I'm grandfathering you in until
00:24:28.000 this and that way it's not like it's
00:24:29.559 changing tomorrow it's delaying the pain
00:24:31.840 and giving them a gift right now as a
00:24:34.039 way of honoring the fact that they've
00:24:36.039 been loyal customers to you those are
00:24:37.559 the main bullets of what that price
00:24:39.279 letter would go out and say and if you
00:24:41.039 are going to raise your prices you want
00:24:43.360 to be measured about it you should know
00:24:45.039 what your conversion rates are prior to
00:24:46.960 you making the price change and you
00:24:48.440 should be able to give a statistically
00:24:49.919 significant sample size of shots on goal
00:24:53.640 with the new price before you make a
00:24:56.000 decision if you get on the phone and the
00:24:57.880 first two people say no well we one knew
00:25:00.880 more people were going to say no we
00:25:01.919 already expected that and if you have
00:25:03.760 call it 40% close rates right now well
00:25:06.840 if you make double the price and you go
00:25:08.720 to 30% close rates then that's still a
00:25:11.080 great deal for you you might just be
00:25:12.799 getting the first two NOS out of the
00:25:14.559 seven NOS you already know you're going
00:25:16.039 to get when you talk to 10 people and so
00:25:17.919 talking to two or three people getting
00:25:19.120 NOS doesn't mean you need to change your
00:25:20.679 price it might have just been the nose
00:25:22.200 you're normally going to get even at
00:25:23.360 your lower price and so you can't be
00:25:25.080 emotional about this you have to be
00:25:26.480 calculated and this in my opinion is the
00:25:28.320 the reason most people don't raise their
00:25:30.080 prices or can't do it successfully
00:25:31.919 number eight talk to customers to solve
00:25:34.600 all your problems so Paul Graham said
00:25:36.480 this and I think it's really good he
00:25:37.520 said you can solve just about every
00:25:38.840 business Problem by talking to your
00:25:40.320 customers so if your advertising isn't
00:25:42.279 converting talk to your customers if
00:25:44.279 your pages aren't converting talk to
00:25:46.080 your customers if the price seems weird
00:25:48.159 talk to your customers If the product
00:25:49.720 isn't delivering talk to your customers
00:25:51.799 at the end of the day your customers are
00:25:53.360 the people you serve and they have all
00:25:55.120 the information you need to make your
00:25:56.960 product better so especially when you're
00:26:00.760 starting out even if you have very low
00:26:03.440 prices so let's say you charge $10 a
00:26:05.279 month for something all right and it's
00:26:06.720 and you want this thing to have
00:26:07.919 thousands and thousands of customers
00:26:10.240 okay fine but if you don't talk to
00:26:14.279 customers you're not going to know
00:26:16.000 what's going to drive them to convert
00:26:17.919 buy and stay and so I come from an
00:26:20.600 industry where people meet face tace in
00:26:22.760 person to sell $10 a month memberships
00:26:24.880 and so I don't want to hear it all right
00:26:26.760 I spent the first four or five years of
00:26:28.559 my career selling $30 $50 $100 things
00:26:33.520 all day long I don't know a very
00:26:35.600 successful advertising entrepreneur
00:26:37.480 who's a rain maker meaning they know how
00:26:39.039 to get customers who didn't have four or
00:26:41.760 five years of Hardcore sales under their
00:26:44.000 belt that no one knew who they were
00:26:46.039 right that's the rocky cut scene is
00:26:47.399 where you take hundreds and thousands of
00:26:49.559 calls with customers where you hear the
00:26:51.840 words they use so that when you you say
00:26:54.840 does this suck but they say it
00:26:56.720 differently and so then you say that in
00:26:58.240 in your advertising and when you take
00:26:59.559 these sales gos for $10 a month you're
00:27:01.440 not doing it for the $10 a month you're
00:27:03.399 doing it so that you can learn more
00:27:04.720 about them and you just so happen to get
00:27:06.480 paid but you find out the words that get
00:27:08.960 them to move because you might think
00:27:11.159 these are all the selling points to your
00:27:12.559 thing but when you're talking to them
00:27:14.200 nothing really happens then you say one
00:27:15.679 thing and then boom their eyes light up
00:27:17.440 and they're like yeah that and then all
00:27:18.880 of a sudden you reorder your sales
00:27:20.120 scripts you reorder your headlines you
00:27:21.919 re order the the road map on the things
00:27:24.559 that you're going to improve in the
00:27:25.440 product because these are actually the
00:27:26.679 things that are driving purchases
00:27:28.679 for the first purchase and getting them
00:27:30.320 to stay and so most entrepreneurs are
00:27:33.399 afraid to talk to customers I have no
00:27:35.320 idea why that is they're afraid to talk
00:27:38.120 to random people who are giving them
00:27:39.679 money I don't get it but one of the
00:27:42.600 easiest ways you can learn more about
00:27:44.039 your business to make more money is pick
00:27:45.440 up the phone and call people who've
00:27:47.320 given you money and ask them why they
00:27:48.960 did and just as importantly maybe more
00:27:51.399 importantly talk to all the people who
00:27:53.240 didn't buy and ask them why they did it
00:27:55.159 yeah and if you think you're above this
00:27:56.960 you're right you should just keep doing
00:27:58.840 that but for everybody who wants to beat
00:28:00.519 that guy just get on the phone with your
00:28:01.960 customers so inside of school.com we run
00:28:04.320 a contest every month where the top 10
00:28:06.000 people who are new to the platform who
00:28:08.559 generate the most Revenue in their
00:28:10.039 communities get to fly out to Vegas and
00:28:12.080 spend a day with me and Sam who's the
00:28:13.799 other owner of school and part of the
00:28:16.120 reason we do this is that of course it's
00:28:18.159 a great prize for all the winners and
00:28:19.640 they get to meet each other and it's an
00:28:20.799 awesome event but for us we get such
00:28:23.559 valuable user feedback from Super users
00:28:26.159 these are the highest most invested
00:28:27.880 users users and so we're like hey do you
00:28:30.039 like this thing hey this is the product
00:28:31.679 room hey would you prioritize this over
00:28:33.640 this so recently we used the feedback
00:28:35.399 from this group we said hey we have this
00:28:37.080 thing that could be controversial with
00:28:39.000 the rest of the community because we
00:28:40.679 could see people taking it like this if
00:28:42.399 we made this change in the product what
00:28:44.120 would you guys think and unanimously
00:28:46.080 they're like oh no that would make us
00:28:47.480 more money we're totally in for it and
00:28:49.279 so we're like wow and so months of
00:28:51.360 deliberation of like oh do you think
00:28:53.600 they'll like it I don't know if they'll
00:28:55.000 like it what if they don't like it all
00:28:56.679 of that got solved by just asking them
00:28:58.760 and then we got our answer and then we
00:28:59.919 did it and everyone was happy and so the
00:29:01.720 beauty of this is that you get certainty
00:29:03.559 around your decisions and so you can
00:29:04.960 make decisions faster and the
00:29:06.600 entrepreneurs who make faster decisions
00:29:08.760 move faster and when you do talk to
00:29:11.000 customers whether it's in person like
00:29:12.600 this school event that I was talking
00:29:13.880 about or just on the phone what do you
00:29:15.960 think happens to them you can take
00:29:17.559 someone from a neutral customer to a
00:29:19.240 Super Fan in one call you can tell the
00:29:21.640 story of the business you can tell them
00:29:22.960 why they started you show that you care
00:29:25.080 and guess what that person might bring
00:29:26.600 you 10 or 50 more people people when you
00:29:28.600 think two rows down the line of Word of
00:29:31.000 Mouth referrals and of course they're
00:29:32.519 probably going to stay way longer than
00:29:33.559 they would otherwise because if they do
00:29:34.960 have an issue guess what they're going
00:29:36.039 to do instead of cancelling they're
00:29:37.320 going to call you and let you know a
00:29:39.279 great time to do this that a lot of
00:29:40.519 people don't like is that the moment
00:29:42.320 people ask to cancel so if you have any
00:29:44.600 kind of recurring membership or if they
00:29:46.279 ask for a refund if you have onetime
00:29:47.679 transactions get on the phone with them
00:29:49.760 and it's not necessarily to try and like
00:29:51.559 you know hard sell them back into it
00:29:52.880 which by all means you can but the more
00:29:55.279 valuable thing is to understand what
00:29:56.600 went wrong and you'd be surprised how
00:29:59.080 many times you just let someone vent and
00:30:00.760 here's the key don't minimize what they
00:30:03.279 said get more angry about the reason
00:30:05.679 they're cancelling than they are because
00:30:07.399 you're like that's ridiculous that
00:30:08.519 should have never happened to you I
00:30:09.720 can't believe that was your experience I
00:30:11.559 completely understand why you'd want a
00:30:12.840 refund I would want to refund 10 times
00:30:14.200 over I'm surprised you're not trying to
00:30:15.080 put me in jail I get it all right is
00:30:17.600 there is there a world that I can make
00:30:19.440 this right or what would it take for me
00:30:21.399 this is the question what would it take
00:30:22.600 for me to make this right and so now you
00:30:25.000 get into them solving what it would cost
00:30:26.960 or what it would take for them to stay
00:30:28.720 and more times than not it's not as big
00:30:30.480 as you think you want to talk to all
00:30:31.919 sorts of customers so you want to talk
00:30:33.039 to the super users you want to talk to
00:30:34.240 the moderate users and you want to talk
00:30:35.399 to the low users but you're going to get
00:30:36.480 different things out of it like I don't
00:30:37.640 I'm not going to prioritize a road map
00:30:39.279 or things that I'm going to reinvest in
00:30:40.559 the business based on people who are not
00:30:41.799 that invested in the business I want to
00:30:43.200 I want to talk to the super users who
00:30:44.320 are getting the most out of it because
00:30:45.279 they're going to have more context but
00:30:47.600 in terms of what problem do I want to
00:30:48.960 solve for these people it's like why
00:30:50.279 didn't this work for you so this would
00:30:52.279 be stuff that's like friction so this is
00:30:54.159 going to be way more about getting new
00:30:55.360 customers like I'm going to solve new
00:30:56.480 customer Problems by finding out why
00:30:57.679 people didn't buy or bought and then
00:30:59.080 left and then I'm going to figure out
00:31:01.519 how to make my customers more valuable
00:31:03.000 and get them to stay longer by talking
00:31:04.840 to Super users uh and your super fans or
00:31:07.519 the best customers you have about what
00:31:09.320 would make this even better number nine
00:31:11.600 what to say to prospects on the phone
00:31:13.880 when you're just starting to get your
00:31:15.480 first sales so I use something called
00:31:17.399 The Closer framework I'll make it very
00:31:19.000 short but the call should go something
00:31:21.240 like this C so closer is an acronym C
00:31:24.559 clarify why they're there so what made
00:31:26.000 you hop on the call what made you take a
00:31:27.960 step what made you respond to my email
00:31:29.440 what made you comment on my post
00:31:31.240 whatever it is they took an action to
00:31:32.679 become an Engaged lead and that is your
00:31:34.159 advantage because any person that you
00:31:36.120 get on the phone with with the exception
00:31:37.559 of a true true cold call first pickup
00:31:41.240 with the exception of that everyone has
00:31:43.039 responded to an email they've commented
00:31:44.720 on a post they've responded to an ad
00:31:46.519 they've opted in whatever so you ask
00:31:48.399 them why they did that that clarifies it
00:31:50.600 gives you also big Authority in the
00:31:52.399 frame because they've taken a step
00:31:53.880 towards you and you're just receiving so
00:31:56.120 you say hey why'd you do that and then
00:31:57.960 they'll tell you what it was then you
00:31:59.720 move on to L which is like okay so what
00:32:01.480 I'm hearing is and this is labeling with
00:32:03.120 a problem so it sounds like you want
00:32:05.039 this and this is the problem or you're
00:32:06.840 you want to have this outcome and you
00:32:08.039 haven't gotten it yet is that sound
00:32:09.360 about right they're going to say yes and
00:32:10.919 you're like okay cool then you go to O
00:32:13.240 and you say you're going to overview
00:32:14.880 their past experiences you're like okay
00:32:16.720 so what have you done so far to try and
00:32:18.799 make this happen why is this so
00:32:20.519 important to you what else has happened
00:32:22.480 in the meantime that has costed you from
00:32:24.960 not having this occur right and we call
00:32:27.039 this the pain cycle the reason you do
00:32:29.000 the pain cycle before you sell something
00:32:31.200 is that you want to temporarily increase
00:32:33.679 their deprivation around that outcome so
00:32:36.000 we want to temporarily in the state of
00:32:37.720 the conversation increase how important
00:32:40.120 that outcome is for them so you've
00:32:41.880 probably heard in in politics whatever
00:32:44.960 the topic is of the debate it's like
00:32:46.440 it's the economy it's education it's the
00:32:49.240 border right whatever media puts more
00:32:51.639 attention on is what people say is the
00:32:54.360 main reason they vote for candidates
00:32:55.840 they basically make that the topic of
00:32:58.000 the election which is the macroeconomic
00:32:59.919 situation or whatever right when you're
00:33:01.840 in a micro event like a sales call you
00:33:04.639 have sometimes 10 minutes sometimes an
00:33:06.840 hour to basically in that very small
00:33:09.279 call Elevate the importance of that
00:33:12.600 problem in their life so that you can
00:33:14.240 motivate action they were kind of hungry
00:33:16.200 when they get on the call but as you
00:33:17.600 talk about the food that they could be
00:33:19.200 having and the bad food they've been
00:33:20.720 eating every single day and how crappy
00:33:22.519 it is and how it's not good for them and
00:33:24.200 how tasty and delicious this food is
00:33:26.360 what are we doing we're increasing their
00:33:28.000 deprivation we're making them hungrier
00:33:30.279 so that when we make our offer they're
00:33:32.320 more likely to take it which then goes
00:33:34.399 to S which is you sell the vacation and
00:33:36.519 the reason I say sell the vacation not
00:33:37.799 the plane flight is most salespeople
00:33:40.279 most new entrepreneurs want to focus on
00:33:42.200 their features they want to talk about
00:33:43.880 the flight they want to talk about TSA
00:33:45.440 they want to talk about check-in they
00:33:46.519 want to talk about their bags they want
00:33:47.519 to talk about their seat all of these
00:33:49.120 things that are on the way to Maui their
00:33:51.919 destination you want to just talk about
00:33:53.960 Maui you want to talk about the lick
00:33:55.760 your fingers good what it's going to be
00:33:57.559 like when they have a full stomach and
00:33:59.159 they're feeling great with their family
00:34:00.519 at the restaurant that's what we want to
00:34:02.639 talk about we don't want to talk about
00:34:03.960 how they're going to order it we don't
00:34:05.440 want to talk about the the selection we
00:34:07.279 don't to talk about how many times
00:34:08.480 they're going to get their drinks
00:34:09.399 refilled we don't talk about any of that
00:34:10.800 we want to talk about Maui we want to
00:34:12.199 talk about being on the beach with the
00:34:14.320 wind in their hair with a my tie in hand
00:34:16.800 that's what we want to talk about sell
00:34:18.480 the vacation typically is a three-point
00:34:20.280 pitch which is by the way you can
00:34:21.800 separate anything into three points
00:34:24.079 right now you just Chunk Up or chunk
00:34:25.399 down based on hey what does it take to
00:34:27.040 be successful it's like you need Fitness
00:34:29.199 Nutrition accountability you need the
00:34:30.719 leads to be timely personalized and
00:34:33.239 qualified right whatever it is so it
00:34:35.320 doesn't matter what you're selling you
00:34:36.560 can come up with three points and the
00:34:38.000 people have to say yeah if I had all
00:34:39.239 three of those things I would succeed
00:34:40.760 now at that point someone doesn't say
00:34:42.239 yes you move on to E which is explain
00:34:44.079 away their concerns which are what are
00:34:45.440 the specifics they have that are the
00:34:47.719 reasons that they're not buying which is
00:34:49.599 usually going to be some sort of
00:34:51.040 specifics about the program something
00:34:52.960 time related something money related
00:34:55.280 something decision maker related meaning
00:34:56.839 they have to give the decision-making
00:34:58.320 authority to somebody else or finally
00:35:00.480 them just simply avoiding the decision
00:35:02.160 for fear of making a mistake and so you
00:35:04.000 need to account for all five of those
00:35:05.920 and know how to overcome each of them
00:35:07.640 which I cover in a 4H hour plus video
00:35:10.359 that you can watch on my channel
00:35:11.599 somewhere else R is reinforce the
00:35:13.720 decision so once they have made a
00:35:14.960 decision to buy you're not done yet now
00:35:16.720 the work begins which is the next 24
00:35:18.960 hours is crucial to making sure that
00:35:21.200 they feel really wowed and impressed
00:35:23.119 with your business most customers will
00:35:24.880 judge a business based on the first 24
00:35:27.000 hours post purchase and so if you say
00:35:29.240 hey I'm going to get you three things
00:35:30.440 the next 24 hours you're going to get
00:35:32.000 introduced to this person she's going to
00:35:33.560 do this and this is what's going to
00:35:34.680 happen next then you make those promises
00:35:36.720 and you keep those promises within that
00:35:38.400 time frame and ideally you do it even
00:35:40.280 faster than you promised you want their
00:35:41.920 impression to be like man these guys are
00:35:43.440 dial The Closer framework is simple that
00:35:45.640 simple enough that you can teach it to
00:35:46.920 somebody else and when I was starting in
00:35:48.320 my gym journey I had sold every single
00:35:50.599 membership for a year plus and until I
00:35:54.160 had somebody else come in who had never
00:35:56.440 sold weight loss and have them follow
00:35:58.960 the c l s r framework in the sales pitch
00:36:03.160 and then saw them close their first sale
00:36:05.359 without me I like I actually cried I was
00:36:07.960 like so I was like oh my God I someone
00:36:10.240 else can sell this like I this may
00:36:11.839 actually be a business and so learning
00:36:14.480 to sell in this framework also make
00:36:16.440 makes it duplicatable so that you can
00:36:17.839 give it to somebody else over time
00:36:19.119 number 10 and this is big before you
00:36:21.280 even think about doing something new do
00:36:24.359 10 times more of what's already working
00:36:26.560 and so this is like one of the things as
00:36:28.160 soon as I buy a portfolio company what
00:36:30.160 I'll do is I go to the head of marketing
00:36:33.040 I go to the founder and I say hey why
00:36:34.560 can't we 10x what we're currently doing
00:36:36.040 tell me why we can't honestly two times
00:36:39.040 out of three they're like I mean we
00:36:40.119 could and I'm like then why aren't we
00:36:41.640 doing that and what happens is they have
00:36:43.960 all these other priorities that are not
00:36:45.920 going to 10x the business and they have
00:36:47.960 this one thing that we already know
00:36:49.400 works that that we have nothing that's
00:36:51.640 stopping us from 10 Xing the business
00:36:53.040 and I say great let's do that call me in
00:36:55.440 6 months now the thing is is in one out
00:36:57.920 of three times to say well we can't 10x
00:37:00.079 this because of this thing then I say
00:37:02.480 guess what the constraint of this
00:37:03.560 business is solving that and if you're
00:37:06.640 doing anything but solving that then
00:37:09.319 you're not growing the business right as
00:37:11.240 a Founder rather you're not growing it
00:37:12.839 as fast as you could be growing it you
00:37:14.680 doing outbound it's like great why can't
00:37:16.599 we do 10 times the outbound well I don't
00:37:18.280 have enough leads from from lists okay
00:37:20.119 great so our constraint of 10x in this
00:37:21.920 business is that we need to find more
00:37:23.400 sources for list so we need to either
00:37:25.000 scrape more lists we need to buy more
00:37:26.440 lists or make more lists ourselves eles
00:37:28.480 okay that's solvable let's do that if
00:37:31.280 it's hey uh if we 10x are advertising
00:37:34.599 dollars like we just need to add more to
00:37:36.400 the budget oh we can't do that because
00:37:38.400 our ads aren't good enough okay great so
00:37:40.440 we need to have more creative that's the
00:37:42.319 constraint of the business if it's
00:37:45.040 content which is why can't we make 10x
00:37:47.079 content or make our content 10 times
00:37:48.960 better or maybe realistically a
00:37:51.000 combination of the two which is we're
00:37:52.640 going to put out two times the content
00:37:54.280 and we're also going try to make it two
00:37:55.640 to three times better great then guess
00:37:57.920 what now we have a Sixx can we triple
00:37:59.520 the content and make it three times
00:38:00.480 better sure well what did we do in the
00:38:02.480 best content that we had that we're not
00:38:04.200 doing in all the other pieces great can
00:38:06.240 we tempti that and make that the
00:38:08.440 Playbook that we use with every piece of
00:38:10.359 content great we're not doing that cool
00:38:12.720 let's do that before we do any of these
00:38:14.760 other ideas that you had and so a lot of
00:38:17.680 entrepreneurs because it's boring to
00:38:19.599 them they figured out how to do this one
00:38:21.760 thing and they think oh I should figure
00:38:23.040 out how to do something else when once
00:38:24.920 you get something to work the whole goal
00:38:27.560 is to beat the living hell out of it is
00:38:29.520 to squeeze every last drop from that
00:38:32.119 thing that works and you do as much as
00:38:34.160 you possibly can as well as you possibly
00:38:36.359 can before even thinking about doing
00:38:38.720 something new so let me walk you through
00:38:40.359 the five stages of the traditional
00:38:42.200 entrepreneur for advertising or even for
00:38:44.240 business they have something that they
00:38:46.920 hear about that they think is cool so
00:38:49.079 they go into uninformed optimism they're
00:38:51.280 really optimistic but they have no idea
00:38:53.720 then they jump into this new thing and
00:38:55.960 they become an inform form Med pessimist
00:38:59.200 and so they find out way more about this
00:39:01.760 thing and then they're like wow this is
00:39:03.839 actually kind of hard and then they go
00:39:05.760 to stage three which is the value of
00:39:07.400 Despair where they're like wow this
00:39:08.960 isn't working this isn't what I thought
00:39:10.520 it was going to be and then what they do
00:39:12.560 is dot dot dot they start over at
00:39:14.920 uninformed optimism because they hear
00:39:16.560 something else is easier but they miss
00:39:18.400 out on step four and five which is they
00:39:20.040 become an informed optimist so they say
00:39:22.359 okay I understand how outbound works I
00:39:24.280 understand how PID ads work I understand
00:39:26.000 how organic works and what are the
00:39:27.480 things that it takes to scale and how
00:39:28.599 much work it really is and then finally
00:39:30.520 get to level five which is achievement
00:39:32.079 which is they actually achieve the goal
00:39:33.560 but most people just repeat 1 2 3 one 2
00:39:36.000 3 uninformed optimism informed pessimism
00:39:38.480 value of Despair start back over and
00:39:40.160 they just hit all three of those over
00:39:41.760 and over and over again whether that's
00:39:43.480 new marketing channels new products new
00:39:45.680 businesses and this is a version of the
00:39:47.920 woman in the red dress is that it's
00:39:49.599 always deceptive to think that the new
00:39:51.560 thing is going to be easier and the only
00:39:53.240 reason you think it's easier is cuz you
00:39:54.720 don't know enough I wish I could just
00:39:56.440 give you the scar issue of having done
00:39:58.400 that three-part triangle over and over
00:40:00.440 again but all I can tell you is that
00:40:01.839 like when I get that little tickle in
00:40:03.160 the back of my neck where I'm like ooh
00:40:04.599 this looks exciting it's now become a
00:40:06.240 warning flag to me because I've been
00:40:07.520 burned so many times doing it to say oh
00:40:10.280 I must not know enough about this
00:40:12.200 because everything is hard I'll give you
00:40:14.440 an an analogy that a mentor gave me that
00:40:16.480 I really liked and I think it applies to
00:40:18.359 a lot of things but when he was talking
00:40:20.240 to me about departments in my business
00:40:21.720 he said you have to know where the
00:40:22.920 bodies are buried and I was like what do
00:40:24.160 you mean by that he said if have you
00:40:25.720 ever talked to like a head of a
00:40:26.640 department like I or HR legal or
00:40:28.640 whatever and they say yep everything's
00:40:30.440 good if you don't know what problems are
00:40:33.880 actually going on in the department
00:40:35.319 you're too far away and so that's in a
00:40:38.240 way uninformed optimism they're just
00:40:40.200 telling you it's great and you don't
00:40:41.440 know any better so you're uninformed but
00:40:43.640 you should know enough about the
00:40:44.800 business to know where all the bodies
00:40:46.000 are buried you should know where all the
00:40:47.040 skeletons in the closet are and so if
00:40:48.760 you're getting into a new thing you have
00:40:51.280 to know all of the ways or as many ways
00:40:53.720 as you possibly can about what's going
00:40:55.280 wrong and once you do a little bit more
00:40:57.319 research you often find out that there's
00:40:59.000 a lot of things you don't know about and
00:41:00.880 guess what the thing you do know is
00:41:02.720 working right now and the likelihood
00:41:04.359 that you doing 10 times more of that has
00:41:06.119 far fewer unknowns than you doing brand
00:41:08.880 new on something net new
00:41:10.280 entrepreneurship already has so many
00:41:12.359 risks and so much
00:41:14.200 unknown basos talks about this he says
00:41:17.359 we want to manage as many of the risks
00:41:20.440 as we can so of course we're going to
00:41:22.720 incur some risks that are going to
00:41:24.119 happen that are unforeseen to us but the
00:41:25.839 risks that we know about we want to
00:41:27.839 limit to the greatest degree possible
00:41:29.520 because there's enough risk of our
00:41:30.680 business going out of business by being
00:41:32.599 a business why take on more risk for no
00:41:35.720 need it's risking what you have and need
00:41:38.119 to survive for what you don't have and
00:41:40.400 don't need which brings me number 11
00:41:42.520 which is growth is
00:41:44.960 stressful stagnation is
00:41:47.680 stressful decline is
00:41:50.440 stressful that means that business is
00:41:53.280 stressful and so the only stressfree
00:41:56.400 people are people people who are dead
00:41:58.560 and if you're in business you need to
00:42:00.599 accept stress as a fact of life and not
00:42:04.640 something wrong with you or wrong with
00:42:07.079 your particular business it's just that
00:42:09.839 things are stressful in general welcome
00:42:11.760 to life and so I see a lot of
00:42:13.599 entrepreneurs try and change their
00:42:15.040 businesses because they feel stressed
00:42:17.240 but every scenario of business has
00:42:19.400 stress there are different kinds of
00:42:20.760 stress but they're all stressful and so
00:42:23.400 the idea that there's something wrong
00:42:24.839 with you or wrong with your business
00:42:26.480 because it is stressful misses the point
00:42:28.920 of how business works and I'll tell you
00:42:30.839 an analogy to make this make sense so if
00:42:33.200 you've been in business for any period
00:42:34.359 of time think about your first business
00:42:36.200 or think about your problems that you
00:42:37.559 had two years ago or three years ago in
00:42:39.640 business you're probably like oh my God
00:42:41.520 those weren't even real problems those
00:42:42.760 were like nothing problems well future
00:42:45.359 you three years from now thinks that
00:42:46.839 about your problems right now and so I
00:42:49.760 think about this a lot because when I
00:42:50.760 think about my problems of like when I
00:42:52.319 was worried about how to get trainer
00:42:53.599 show up on time and like you know some
00:42:55.800 somebody's membership wasn't wasn't
00:42:57.440 recurring I had churn issues or whatever
00:42:58.800 it was within the within the gym that I
00:43:00.359 had those problems I could solve those
00:43:03.000 in my sleep now right because the
00:43:05.240 problems that I have are bigger and so
00:43:06.760 the thing is is that you just become
00:43:09.280 more enduring you become tougher and
00:43:11.880 your tolerance level for stress or what
00:43:14.319 you deem to be stressful goes up and so
00:43:16.880 what's really interesting about this is
00:43:18.319 that I still have the same problems I
00:43:19.960 had when I had a much much much smaller
00:43:21.880 business I just don't think they're
00:43:23.359 problems anymore and so then that means
00:43:25.319 that my choice to categorize the issue
00:43:27.440 as a problem is actually the greater
00:43:29.240 source of stress than the problem
00:43:31.599 itself and if you can adopt that
00:43:33.680 perspective you can be less stressed as
00:43:35.520 you grow and make better decisions and
00:43:37.480 so I just I wanted to to hit this point
00:43:39.680 because I I almost stopped and killed so
00:43:42.520 many businesses early on because I
00:43:44.040 thought there was something wrong with
00:43:44.960 me or something wrong with the business
00:43:46.720 because I was stressed rather than
00:43:48.359 accepting that stress is a fact of life
00:43:50.119 and that I'm going to continue to be
00:43:51.280 stressed as long as I'm alive so
00:43:52.880 fundamentally stress comes from an
00:43:54.079 aversive stimulus a stimulus that's not
00:43:55.920 that's not enjoyable right but if you
00:43:58.960 grow there's tons of things that are not
00:44:00.960 enjoyable about growth if you're
00:44:03.319 stagnating there's tons of things that
00:44:05.000 are not enjoyable about stagnating and
00:44:06.880 if you're declining there's tons of
00:44:08.280 things that are not enjoyable about
00:44:09.520 declining so there's just always going
00:44:11.280 to be things that you don't like get
00:44:12.960 used to it number 12 this is a really
00:44:14.440 tactical one I've come to adopt this
00:44:17.480 theory of something called the look back
00:44:18.839 window which is that customers determine
00:44:22.119 whether a purchase was good based on the
00:44:24.800 last purchase they made and so if you've
00:44:27.280 heard the phrase what have you done for
00:44:28.720 me lately it basically it's phrasing for
00:44:31.240 the look back window so let me give you
00:44:32.680 an example if you're an agency owner
00:44:34.880 right and you start running ads for a
00:44:37.680 customer now let's say the first month
00:44:39.960 you charge $55,000 and they make $40,000
00:44:42.760 with your ads they're happy you're happy
00:44:45.440 the next month you charge the same
00:44:47.319 $5,000 and let's say they make $5,000
00:44:50.599 well they're less happy you still made
00:44:53.000 $5,000 but they're not thrilled but in
00:44:55.559 your mind you're like well I covered
00:44:56.680 myself last month for eight plus months
00:44:58.760 because of how much money I made them
00:45:00.240 and on the third month they cancel and
00:45:02.440 you're like WTF on the first month I
00:45:04.559 made you eight months worth of paying me
00:45:07.040 but the thing is is that the way the
00:45:08.760 customer perceives that is the first
00:45:10.720 month I paid five and got 40 that was a
00:45:12.520 good deal the second month I paid five
00:45:14.240 and got five third month you know what I
00:45:16.960 don't want to risk it anymore I'm out
00:45:18.760 and so they will make a judgment on the
00:45:22.040 purchasing decision based on the last
00:45:24.040 purchase and so we can leverage that as
00:45:26.200 business owners by extending the look
00:45:28.160 back window which means that the less
00:45:30.640 frequently we Bill the longer people
00:45:33.680 stay think about this for a second if I
00:45:35.680 build every single day there would
00:45:37.760 likely be a day that I had not provided
00:45:39.240 that customer value and maybe there's
00:45:40.559 two or three days in a row and so likely
00:45:42.240 they would cancel two or three days into
00:45:44.520 not getting value being buil daily is
00:45:46.400 pretty high if I build annually they
00:45:48.520 would only have an opportunity to churn
00:45:51.079 once a year and the thing is is at that
00:45:54.119 point of turn what would they do now in
00:45:56.280 the agency example I gave let's say they
00:45:59.440 made the 40 and the five and then they
00:46:01.040 made five and five let's say throughout
00:46:02.440 the year we had two more good months and
00:46:04.119 all in all we made them 100 Grand and
00:46:06.319 they paid US 60 right or whatever now
00:46:08.800 when they look back they're going to see
00:46:10.559 100 versus 60 but if we bill monthly
00:46:13.280 there's going to be multiple months
00:46:14.720 where they were negative or break even
00:46:16.760 and so the longer the window of time you
00:46:19.359 do between Billings the longer the time
00:46:21.800 you have to provide value and excess of
00:46:23.920 your price so it allows for Less vola fa
00:46:27.040 ility in their business and yours and so
00:46:29.160 this is something that took me way too
00:46:30.880 long to learn but as much as possible
00:46:33.720 try and build for longer durations and
00:46:35.760 I'm not saying get people to commit to
00:46:37.319 contracts that's not what I'm saying I'm
00:46:39.160 saying try and Bill Upfront for longer
00:46:42.359 periods of time I'm willing to take a
00:46:44.200 hit on some pricing which may seem
00:46:46.319 counter to what I'm saying so that I can
00:46:48.000 get higher LTV meaning if I know that I
00:46:50.640 can cut churn by 3x by reducing my price
00:46:53.839 by 30% so that they can pay three months
00:46:56.280 up front or six months up front then I'm
00:46:58.640 more than happy to do that and so
00:47:00.440 there's two ways you can use a strategy
00:47:02.400 strategy one is you just say this is how
00:47:03.960 we do business and we need people who
00:47:05.720 are committed because there's going to
00:47:06.920 be volatility and we don't want the
00:47:08.359 short-term volatility to affect our
00:47:10.040 relationship and that's a legitimate
00:47:11.359 reason to do it the other way you can do
00:47:13.520 it is just have it as one of two options
00:47:15.280 one that has some sort of prepayment
00:47:16.640 discount that's associated with it or
00:47:18.040 prepayment bonus which is one of the
00:47:19.280 things I like um some level of service
00:47:21.440 or some guarantee that comes with
00:47:22.720 prepayment that doesn't come with
00:47:24.119 month-to-month all right and by the way
00:47:25.880 you can add a guarantee
00:47:27.520 to people who prepay and not to people
00:47:29.280 who don't so if people want to decrease
00:47:30.720 their risk so think about they're
00:47:31.839 they're taking on more Risk by prepaying
00:47:33.800 but you attenuate or you offset that
00:47:35.559 risk by adding a
00:47:37.599 guarantee so they pay the same price but
00:47:39.760 they get a reduction in risk for taking
00:47:41.359 on an increased amount of risk so if you
00:47:43.400 offer an annual pricing we know across
00:47:45.880 our portfolio because we do this in a
00:47:47.079 lot of businesses if you if you don't
00:47:49.079 make it the default payment method and
00:47:50.720 you just offer it you'll get about 10 to
00:47:52.400 15% of people who take the the prepaid
00:47:54.680 annual option now here's what's cool
00:47:56.240 about that is that if call it 10% of
00:47:59.200 people take that option you double your
00:48:01.040 cash flow in the business because you
00:48:02.559 get a 12x Price Right on one out of 10
00:48:06.520 or one out of seven people who decide to
00:48:08.880 buy well if you do that then you double
00:48:10.800 the amount of cash you get up front and
00:48:12.119 so for many people and many businesses
00:48:14.240 that little change alone can allow
00:48:16.480 marketing and advertising to be
00:48:17.880 profitable and the reason having more
00:48:19.400 cash up front is helpful for a business
00:48:20.880 owner is that you can offset the cost of
00:48:23.559 advertising and the cost of sales
00:48:25.200 commissions and so you can have the
00:48:26.800 these costs you have to incur to get the
00:48:28.359 person in the door and so if you can
00:48:29.960 frontload the cash from the customer
00:48:31.599 then it means that you can do more of
00:48:33.720 that faster because something called a
00:48:34.960 cash conversion cycle which basically
00:48:36.240 just means how fast do I get the cash
00:48:37.800 back that I put out to get somebody new
00:48:39.200 in and if I can break even on that or
00:48:41.280 even be profitable on that in the first
00:48:43.079 seven days then guess what I can do with
00:48:44.680 the money go back and get another
00:48:46.160 customer or two or five throughout my
00:48:48.599 history as a business owner I've had
00:48:51.160 four periods where I had tremendous
00:48:53.240 growth and in each of those periods it's
00:48:55.359 where I was making more more than two to
00:48:58.079 three times what it cost me to both
00:48:59.760 acquire and deliver for two customers in
00:49:03.319 the first 30 days and so what that means
00:49:06.040 is if I pay to get a customer and then
00:49:08.319 that customer comes pre-loaded with the
00:49:09.839 cash to deliver for him and get another
00:49:12.359 customer and deliver to that customer
00:49:14.680 then cash no longer is a constraint in
00:49:16.160 the business which means that I can
00:49:17.799 pretty much just crank the advertising
00:49:20.119 until something else breaks in my
00:49:21.920 business I mean this is how I had $1,000
00:49:24.280 in my bank account in December of 2016
00:49:26.880 and then in 20 months was doing 4.4
00:49:28.920 million a month like the only way you
00:49:30.680 could do that is getting it is basically
00:49:32.280 have an infinite money glitch that
00:49:33.960 happens because the thing is is that the
00:49:35.559 money that you want is out there there's
00:49:37.520 money everywhere if you look out the
00:49:39.280 window if you look in the room you have
00:49:41.079 there's somebody who paints your walls
00:49:42.480 there's somebody who buy who
00:49:43.839 manufactures those camera there's an
00:49:45.319 electric company that funds this whole
00:49:46.520 thing there's internet there's money in
00:49:48.520 everything that you see with your eyes
00:49:50.520 and you're afraid that there's not
00:49:52.000 enough money out there there is you just
00:49:54.640 have to access it and you can access it
00:49:56.960 with skill by making sure that the
00:49:58.799 pricing that you have and the terms that
00:50:00.319 go with the purchases that you have
00:50:01.880 allow you to advertise profitably so
00:50:04.000 that you can get as many customers as
00:50:05.520 you darn well please without entering
00:50:07.160 your pockets but by entering theirs
00:50:08.799 number 13 try and sell sawdust so I was
00:50:12.240 talking a really good friend of mine who
00:50:13.599 does 100 plus million a year and I was
00:50:16.480 talking about this concept of sawdust
00:50:18.280 which is in the businesses that we have
00:50:20.559 I try and look at what are all of the
00:50:22.400 assets that we already have at our
00:50:24.160 disposal right and so with acquisition.
00:50:26.880 for example I was talking to him about
00:50:28.280 this I was like well I already have a
00:50:29.880 building I already have the team that
00:50:31.760 runs my portfolio and I already have all
00:50:34.000 this lead flow from companies that are
00:50:36.119 not big enough to be portfolio companies
00:50:37.920 but they're still big enough that we
00:50:38.880 could help and then someday later become
00:50:40.799 portfolio companies and I was like is
00:50:42.440 there a way that without adding more
00:50:44.040 infrastructure to my existing business I
00:50:46.200 could use the sawdust the stuff we
00:50:47.960 already have to create a product or
00:50:50.920 service that would meet the needs of
00:50:52.079 those customers and so the sawdust
00:50:54.040 analogy just comes from Saw Lumber Mills
00:50:57.240 so they take these trees they put them
00:50:59.040 in through the the lumber Mills they cut
00:51:00.520 them up and they put them in the planks
00:51:02.680 but at the bottom what they figured out
00:51:04.400 is there's all the sawdust and then some
00:51:06.799 very intelligent engineer was like huh
00:51:08.559 we're just taking all the sawdust and
00:51:09.680 we're throwing it out the back is there
00:51:11.440 something we could do with this well it
00:51:12.960 turns out one sawdust is great for
00:51:15.520 plants and growing and putting it in a
00:51:17.040 mulch and things like that but also if
00:51:18.920 we mix this with glue we have more wood
00:51:22.079 planks that we can create afterwards
00:51:23.760 just using the sawdust and the chips and
00:51:25.640 so they created a whole another Revenue
00:51:27.520 line from stuff they already had and so
00:51:30.359 right now in your business you have
00:51:31.960 sawdust and it just takes a little bit
00:51:33.720 of creativity to think how can I
00:51:35.400 recombine some of these things that I'm
00:51:36.920 already doing to then create another
00:51:39.480 product line that doesn't take
00:51:40.799 operational infrastructure for me to add
00:51:43.280 to sell and then those added product
00:51:45.599 lines often are huge margin increases
00:51:48.520 because it's all profit because it's
00:51:50.400 something that you already are incurring
00:51:51.720 the cost for your main business so you
00:51:53.720 can have this and the key to making this
00:51:55.400 work is that it can not increase
00:51:57.760 operational drag if you have to do a
00:51:59.640 whole another thing in order to make
00:52:00.880 this work that's not what you want the
00:52:02.520 idea is the sawdust is already there and
00:52:04.640 then all you have to do is gather it put
00:52:06.440 the glue on it and then you have another
00:52:07.960 product that's the concept I didn't buy
00:52:11.160 another building I didn't hire another
00:52:13.640 portfolio team it's just I use the team
00:52:15.240 that I already have and they come down
00:52:17.000 and they explain what they do within our
00:52:18.559 portfolio companies to these businesses
00:52:20.400 so they can become portfolio ready so
00:52:21.880 they understand oh this is how they
00:52:23.079 Market at a higher level oh this is how
00:52:24.720 they hire at a higher level oh this is
00:52:26.599 how they price oh this is how they uh
00:52:28.680 sell and how they scale sales teams all
00:52:30.880 of those Concepts I already have the
00:52:34.119 information and expertise within my
00:52:35.880 existing portfolio because I do it every
00:52:37.200 day but by just having another way for
00:52:40.920 people to have access obviously less
00:52:43.920 than a portfolio company would to that
00:52:45.920 team then I have another way to generate
00:52:48.119 Revenue without having to occur the cost
00:52:51.079 associated with building out a whole
00:52:52.119 another business so the process that I
00:52:53.520 go through is I think about all of the
00:52:55.119 resources and assets that I have
00:52:56.680 currently available so you have to be as
00:52:59.079 detailed as you can because it's usually
00:53:00.559 like a tiny piece from here it's the
00:53:02.400 glue that we use for this part of the
00:53:05.160 the log process but then we have the
00:53:07.280 sawdust from over here if we put those
00:53:09.160 together boom we have these new logs and
00:53:10.960 we have the plank making machine Let's
00:53:13.200 combine them and then we can do it
00:53:14.440 ourselves right and so you have to think
00:53:16.640 okay what are the what are the talents
00:53:18.040 and the people that I have available
00:53:19.559 what are the digital assets or physical
00:53:21.440 assets that I have uh available to me
00:53:23.359 and is there a new way that I can
00:53:24.440 combine these things and so a simple one
00:53:26.319 with was like in in the gym space right
00:53:28.440 I had brick and mortar but we were only
00:53:31.000 using the space from 5:00 a.m. to 9:00
00:53:33.720 a.m. and then from 5 uh then from 400
00:53:35.799 p.m. to 700 or 8:00 p.m. right so that
00:53:37.799 means the rest of the day if I wanted to
00:53:39.799 be a more clever business owner I could
00:53:41.359 say what businesses use a gym and turf
00:53:45.079 in the middle of the day that I can rent
00:53:47.000 that space to that's sawdust that's
00:53:49.200 additional Revenue that basically cost
00:53:50.760 me nothing and so all I would have to do
00:53:52.359 is say hey I'm available so if you have
00:53:54.559 a team training thing or you you have
00:53:56.880 some sort of sports thing with kids that
00:53:58.400 goes in the middle of the day or Ends by
00:54:00.160 4 then you can use my whole facility and
00:54:02.480 now my facility is generating Revenue
00:54:04.000 because I'm paying the cost of owning
00:54:05.640 that facility 247 and so I might as well
00:54:08.240 make money from that so a different way
00:54:10.079 of using that is called excess capacity
00:54:12.000 so if you have excess capacity like uber
00:54:14.040 is based on excess capacity people have
00:54:15.680 cars they're not using them Airbnb you
00:54:17.280 have an extra room it's excess capacity
00:54:19.440 these are businesses built on other
00:54:21.200 people's sawdust and you have sawdust in
00:54:23.640 your business so you might as well use
00:54:25.119 it yourself this is really the concept
00:54:26.920 of double and triple and quadruple
00:54:28.559 dipping is how can I get more leverage
00:54:30.079 from the same thing and so I tell
00:54:32.079 stories about our about our portfolio
00:54:33.720 companies which like that gives me I
00:54:36.280 have to do an intervention with the
00:54:37.280 portfolio company either way but if I
00:54:38.839 tell the story about it I get to double
00:54:40.119 dip and use that as content and so there
00:54:42.400 are many opportunities where you can get
00:54:43.599 leverage you get more for what you put
00:54:44.839 in by reusing the same thing in multiple
00:54:48.440 different
00:54:49.799 scenarios and so most businesses have
00:54:52.319 tons of these excess capacity or double
00:54:54.799 and triple dip potential poal sitting
00:54:57.400 inside their business and they're not
00:54:58.760 using them the workshops that I talked
00:55:01.599 about I get to make content from those
00:55:03.880 workshops I get deal flow from those
00:55:05.319 workshops we get cash flow from those
00:55:06.640 workshops my team gets more exposure to
00:55:08.799 different types of businesses Industries
00:55:10.280 so they also get better and so there's
00:55:12.760 many value additive uh things that stack
00:55:15.839 on top of each other from one decision
00:55:17.720 by the way if you want to check out one
00:55:18.799 of our workshops you can go to
00:55:19.640 acquisition. comom we'd love to talk to
00:55:21.359 you it's for business owners only so if
00:55:23.000 you don't have a business go to
00:55:24.280 school.com and we can help you start one
00:55:26.559 number 14 arm your salespeople so I see
00:55:29.119 too often a lot of Founders and
00:55:31.000 entrepreneurs have this kind of like
00:55:32.760 animosity between their sales team they
00:55:34.039 feel like they shouldn't pay their sales
00:55:34.880 team that much my Sal team so needy they
00:55:36.960 only want lay down customers they're
00:55:38.200 always complaining about the leads
00:55:39.559 whatever no like you should be the
00:55:41.240 tightest with your sales team because
00:55:43.839 your sales team is the life is the cash
00:55:46.200 flow is the life flow of your business
00:55:48.000 if you don't have sales you don't have a
00:55:49.319 business so they should get that level
00:55:50.599 of esteem and honestly a huge portion of
00:55:52.880 the business should be pretty much
00:55:54.079 allocated to supporting them anding
00:55:56.440 their core activities and so one of the
00:55:58.039 main things that I like to do is two
00:55:59.880 things one I arm my salespeople with an
00:56:03.720 Excel sheet that has all the pieces of
00:56:06.039 content that I have that can help
00:56:08.039 overcome specific concerns from
00:56:10.160 customers and so right now if you don't
00:56:12.079 have a piece of content that overcomes
00:56:14.599 every main concern a customer has about
00:56:16.720 your services or your products do it and
00:56:19.680 then as soon as you do it the best
00:56:21.520 converting of those things one you'll
00:56:23.480 know because you'll get sales from them
00:56:25.000 because people will DM you about it like
00:56:26.520 oh I didn't know that now I'm interested
00:56:28.799 take those put them into a list so that
00:56:30.440 your sales guys have them and they can
00:56:32.359 send them to customers either before
00:56:33.760 they talk to them or after they talk to
00:56:35.599 them so that they can schedule a
00:56:36.920 follow-up call and say hey let me send
00:56:38.960 you this video it might explain your
00:56:40.160 concerns let's let's touch base tomorrow
00:56:42.240 after you watch it and then you can
00:56:43.640 allow that content to do some of that
00:56:46.079 selling for you and as soon as I did
00:56:48.119 this with my sales team in Fitness when
00:56:50.520 I had weight loss customers and then in
00:56:52.280 gym launch when I had gym owner
00:56:53.480 customers our sales went up and and the
00:56:56.559 thing is is this is nice cuz I didn't
00:56:58.000 have to train any of them anymore they
00:57:00.039 just now had assets and resources they
00:57:01.839 could deploy to leads who were a little
00:57:04.079 bit colder who need a little bit more
00:57:05.240 selling and they wouldn't have to spend
00:57:06.480 time on the phone they just let me do
00:57:07.760 the selling for them via the content
00:57:09.440 that overcome that specific concern now
00:57:11.079 that leads me to the second one which
00:57:12.200 I'll just make as number 15 which is
00:57:14.240 really big a lot of businesses don't do
00:57:16.559 this but you should unify sales and
00:57:20.559 advertising so those should roll into
00:57:22.520 the same person and so I saw this really
00:57:25.039 early on in gym launch we had two
00:57:27.319 departments we had a sales department
00:57:28.559 and we had a marketing department and
00:57:29.920 marketing always said the sales guys
00:57:31.240 weren't closing as many leads as they
00:57:32.520 should and the sales guys always said
00:57:34.039 that the leads weren't good enough or
00:57:35.119 they didn't have enough leads right but
00:57:37.559 when we unified that under a cro Chief
00:57:39.880 Revenue officer which if you're the
00:57:41.280 founder that's you you then say there's
00:57:43.400 really just an acquisition department
00:57:45.480 and fundamentally as I see it
00:57:47.160 advertising and sales sit on the exact
00:57:49.400 same Continuum you have low information
00:57:52.440 buyers and you have high information
00:57:54.119 buyers and so fundamentally a low
00:57:55.720 information buyer needs not a lot of
00:57:57.359 information or already has a certain
00:57:58.920 amount of information to make a
00:58:00.160 purchasing decision a high information
00:58:02.319 buyer requires more information or
00:58:04.599 doesn't have as much information when
00:58:06.079 they start talking to you and so you
00:58:07.599 have to fill in more holes fundamentally
00:58:09.880 sales just fills in the holes that
00:58:12.960 advertising failed to answer and so if
00:58:15.839 you have exceptional best-in-class
00:58:17.640 advertising you don't need sales it's
00:58:19.920 not that they're separate departments
00:58:21.559 they solve the same problem one just
00:58:23.839 communicates one to many the other
00:58:25.640 communicates one-onone people buy real
00:58:27.920 estate on the internet via auction you
00:58:30.079 don't necessarily need to have salese if
00:58:32.160 you give a customer enough information
00:58:34.280 they can make a purchasing decision that
00:58:36.079 being said you're like wait Alex you
00:58:37.559 have salespeople of course I do because
00:58:39.400 there's always going to be a certain
00:58:40.400 number of customers that I can get
00:58:42.200 people to buy automatically and then
00:58:43.680 there's people who still want more
00:58:44.960 information that most likely they didn't
00:58:46.520 see the advertising that answered that
00:58:48.039 question and so then the salesperson can
00:58:49.720 just say oh these are the three piano
00:58:51.400 keys I need to play in order to get you
00:58:52.680 to buy great and they fill that specific
00:58:55.440 information need to turn the customer
00:58:57.200 from a maybe to a yes and so unifying
00:59:00.359 the two departments is one of the
00:59:01.520 highest leverage moves that you can make
00:59:02.839 as a Founder because it eliminates the
00:59:04.559 cross- departmental BS it's we're all
00:59:07.079 here to sell customers and so
00:59:09.559 advertising Works hand inand with sales
00:59:11.799 not in competition with them so that
00:59:13.839 they can get a pat on the head from you
00:59:15.839 or whatever director is running that
00:59:17.240 department so often times you are the
00:59:19.240 chief Revenue officer who's uniting both
00:59:20.920 of those fronts but over time if you can
00:59:23.280 find someone who does that that usually
00:59:24.760 is the FastTrack to being C so kale for
00:59:27.079 example at gym launch became Chief
00:59:28.839 Revenue officer right he basically stood
00:59:31.280 on top of sales and marketing so that he
00:59:35.319 could control the customers coming in
00:59:37.799 the door and then once he knew how to
00:59:39.640 make it rain he could run the business
00:59:41.640 number 16 there are three legs to the
00:59:43.520 stool and so every business needs three
00:59:45.960 big functional leaders you need one
00:59:47.880 person who's in charge of getting
00:59:49.520 customers acquisition you need a second
00:59:52.520 person who's in charge of delivery and
00:59:54.760 getting those customers exactly what was
00:59:56.440 promised and then third you need someone
00:59:58.599 to run the internal operations of the
01:00:00.160 business this is the day-to-day this is
01:00:01.880 everything we do to support the other
01:00:03.200 two functions so this is it legal HR
01:00:06.400 these are the things that are required
01:00:07.760 to keep you out of prison and so you
01:00:10.200 have to have contracts you have to pay
01:00:11.720 people on time you have to have a CRM
01:00:13.960 that that collects all this information
01:00:15.640 and this one functions as a vendor to
01:00:19.319 the other two heads so think about this
01:00:21.960 that person should never be making the
01:00:23.920 big decisions in the business they
01:00:25.680 should be supporting the decisions that
01:00:27.680 enh allow us to get more customers or
01:00:30.079 deliver on those customers better which
01:00:31.720 if you think about it those three legs
01:00:33.520 of the stool roll up to the only three
01:00:36.319 things that you can do to increase
01:00:37.839 Enterprise Value in business you can get
01:00:39.559 more customers you can make them worth
01:00:41.280 more get more customers acquisition make
01:00:42.920 them worth more delivery and you can
01:00:45.200 decrease risk in the business and so
01:00:47.240 that is where the operations comes in if
01:00:49.079 I know that everything's completely
01:00:50.480 dialed we have no massive risk that
01:00:52.200 we're supposed to and we can get as many
01:00:54.000 customers as we don't or please and our
01:00:55.319 LTV can continue to scale that is a
01:00:57.599 valuable business and so it makes sense
01:00:59.160 to have people who are in charge one
01:01:00.920 throat to choke one chest to poke who's
01:01:03.119 in charge of that function and in the
01:01:05.079 beginning you may be all three but as
01:01:07.240 you develop as the entrepreneur you have
01:01:08.680 to think which of these three hats is
01:01:10.520 more Central to my best skill set and
01:01:12.839 then you can start finding the people
01:01:14.599 who will compliment you and so I'll give
01:01:16.520 you my rule of thumb here is that if
01:01:17.960 you're not learning from these people in
01:01:19.880 the interview process about what they
01:01:21.520 can do better than what you're doing you
01:01:23.280 need to hire better now if you're early
01:01:26.319 days and you don't have the cash to
01:01:27.520 bring something like that in then you
01:01:28.680 got to learn a lot and that's part of
01:01:29.880 Entrepreneurship but at some point you
01:01:31.920 want the people that you bring in to be
01:01:33.400 better at the thing than you which if
01:01:35.520 you really think about it means that
01:01:37.440 every business pretty much trickles up
01:01:39.400 to the same thing when taken to its
01:01:40.920 natural extreme which means you're going
01:01:42.400 to have a head of acquisition who might
01:01:44.799 have a sales director a marketing
01:01:46.559 director you're going to have some sort
01:01:48.079 of head of Ops who's going to have it
01:01:50.240 legal HR recruiting all rolling up to
01:01:52.760 them and you're going to have some sort
01:01:53.920 of customer delivery or product person
01:01:56.039 who is going to have fulfillment product
01:01:58.079 experience ux engineering if you have
01:02:00.079 software that are rolling into them if
01:02:02.200 that is what the ultimate end of every
01:02:04.240 business is then guess what your
01:02:05.279 day-to-day looks like in a really big
01:02:06.920 business the same in just about every
01:02:09.240 business and so the idea that you need
01:02:11.480 to keep jumping from thing to thing to
01:02:13.119 thing when the ultimate expression of
01:02:15.119 that business is going to be the same
01:02:16.599 for you at the end kind of seems stupid
01:02:19.039 if I don't like something about the
01:02:20.240 business it's like I just need to get
01:02:21.400 out of it I just need to get above it
01:02:23.240 and so you can just develop the business
01:02:25.400 bring someone else in who does like that
01:02:27.079 thing and then you can have that person
01:02:28.760 reporting to you and then at that point
01:02:30.440 you're doing what every entrepreneur
01:02:31.640 does which is they have a team of people
01:02:33.160 who report to them about the things that
01:02:34.240 they're doing on a daily basis and so
01:02:37.000 don't get too bent out of shape about
01:02:39.760 this is my opinion here this is Al this
01:02:41.520 is advice from me don't get too bound
01:02:44.160 out of shape About the Passion thing
01:02:46.079 like love the
01:02:47.640 game and whether that's selling dry
01:02:50.440 cleaning or selling software or selling
01:02:52.799 books or running a portfolio at the end
01:02:55.559 of the day day it's more or less the
01:02:57.720 same you're going to have a team of
01:02:58.599 people that you like that share your
01:03:00.000 values that share your mission and that
01:03:01.559 you're walking alongside together with
01:03:04.079 and so if you can if you can maintain
01:03:05.799 that frame it will decrease the relative
01:03:08.559 excitement for the woman in the red
01:03:10.079 dress because you know that when it's
01:03:11.319 taken to its natural end it'll be the
01:03:12.799 same as The Natural end of the current
01:03:14.279 business you're in number 17 the person
01:03:16.799 with the highest standard should be in
01:03:18.279 charge so you can think about this at
01:03:20.839 every level of the business and so let's
01:03:23.039 say you have a department for media
01:03:24.799 buyers or you have a department for
01:03:26.160 Content creators or you have a a
01:03:27.680 department for salespeople or you have
01:03:30.119 recruiting at every level in the company
01:03:32.400 the person who has the highest standard
01:03:33.839 the lowest tolerance should be the
01:03:35.520 person who's in charge and that goes all
01:03:37.319 the way up to the top of the business if
01:03:38.559 there's ever someone in your business
01:03:40.400 who is a lower tolerance or has a higher
01:03:42.839 standard for excellence than you that
01:03:45.760 person should be in charge and not you
01:03:47.839 and so I use this as a wonderful litmus
01:03:49.559 test to figure out who do I think should
01:03:51.760 be promoted within a company or a
01:03:54.359 division or a department or even on a
01:03:56.480 tiny team who should be the lead of that
01:03:58.240 team the person who has the highest
01:04:00.200 standards and so when I think okay I've
01:04:02.160 got all these customer support support
01:04:03.440 reps who here has the highest standard
01:04:05.440 for what they believe a customer service
01:04:07.119 experience should look like that's the
01:04:09.079 person you want in charge and so it's
01:04:10.799 not tenure it's not it's not suaveness
01:04:13.279 it's not how much you like them it's not
01:04:14.640 what they look like it's who has the
01:04:16.880 highest standard and so when I was
01:04:19.119 starting up I made a lot of these
01:04:20.760 mistakes I would promote people that I
01:04:22.279 liked a lot I promote people who'd been
01:04:24.160 there longer CU I felt it felt bad bad
01:04:25.920 that this guy had been here for 18
01:04:27.039 months and this person had only been
01:04:28.079 there for 2 months and I'm going to
01:04:29.319 promote that person over the 18-month
01:04:30.640 person but guess what when you have one
01:04:32.760 of those hard situations guess what you
01:04:34.279 get to do you get to talk to the
01:04:35.559 18-month person and you get to explain
01:04:37.039 exactly why the other person got the
01:04:38.839 promotion and what they need to do so
01:04:41.039 that they can get promoted in the future
01:04:42.400 and if you have a winner that person
01:04:43.920 will step up and if you have a loser
01:04:45.799 that person will step out and that's
01:04:47.480 okay number 18 whenever you're
01:04:50.400 hiring make sure that the person raises
01:04:52.960 the average bar and so this is this is
01:04:54.880 one I stole from B this is not mine but
01:04:57.480 it's such a I love decision-making
01:04:59.279 Frameworks because one of the hardest
01:05:00.680 questions I could asked it's on a
01:05:01.680 repeated basis is I don't know who to
01:05:03.680 hire right or I don't know what good for
01:05:06.000 this role looks like and so I'll give
01:05:07.839 you two filters for that hiring process
01:05:11.119 number one is during the hiring process
01:05:13.440 am I learning more from them than
01:05:14.760 they're learning from me now if you take
01:05:17.359 three interviews guess what you might
01:05:19.359 have just three bad candidates just like
01:05:21.359 if you take three sales calls and you
01:05:23.200 might not close any of the three it
01:05:24.720 doesn't mean that you should change
01:05:25.880 anything it might just mean that you got
01:05:27.400 in the phone with three bad customers
01:05:28.839 and just as likely three bad candidates
01:05:31.240 so you want to talk to 10 or 20
01:05:33.880 candidates and then what happens is if
01:05:35.880 you talk to 20 candidates you'll very
01:05:37.720 quickly see who are the people who
01:05:39.400 really know their stuff and who doesn't
01:05:42.400 and so I look for the quantity and
01:05:44.359 quality of metrics that they discuss
01:05:46.400 about their position in terms of how
01:05:48.480 they influence success and so it's how
01:05:50.359 do you define success and then what are
01:05:51.839 the things that you will do what are the
01:05:53.200 actions you take that will influence or
01:05:55.079 increase the life that this successful
01:05:56.640 event occurs and so if someone can't
01:05:58.680 describe to me this sounds very basic in
01:06:01.119 what ways do your actions contribute to
01:06:03.599 this outcome now if you want to the 2011
01:06:06.200 version this is for leadership and up
01:06:07.520 you say how does that outcome Drive
01:06:09.400 outcomes in the larger business if they
01:06:11.599 can't connect those dots guess what they
01:06:14.039 probably won't connect them in your
01:06:15.440 business either now once you have an
01:06:18.599 idea of okay I've talked to 20 people I
01:06:21.520 there's you know three of them actually
01:06:23.240 seem like they knew their stuff they
01:06:24.319 gave me good quantitative quality me
01:06:25.960 they could tie their behaviors to the
01:06:27.480 outcomes they want and they could track
01:06:28.680 that outcome to the overall business
01:06:30.599 okay now I just asked the question of
01:06:33.160 the people that I'm considering which of
01:06:35.319 them raises the bar of the team and it's
01:06:38.119 the team that they're joining so I'm not
01:06:39.440 expecting a Frontline customer service
01:06:40.799 rep to raise the bar of the executive
01:06:42.400 team it's a different skill set
01:06:43.720 different level of employee but if that
01:06:47.000 Frontline customer service rep is going
01:06:48.640 on a team of 10 reps then that person
01:06:51.119 needs to raise the bar we were
01:06:52.680 interviewing for one of our portfolio
01:06:54.079 companies and so we we uh we recruit for
01:06:56.680 our portfolio companies because we have
01:06:58.160 a bigger brand than they do and so we
01:06:59.319 can put really high Lev talent in using
01:07:01.279 my brand to grow their their business
01:07:03.119 faster so it's a way of me growing the
01:07:05.440 Enterprise value of Business Without
01:07:07.720 purposely using my face to grow it so I
01:07:10.000 don't become keyman risk I just leverage
01:07:12.000 my face to get the best talent into
01:07:13.760 those companies and that's why they grow
01:07:14.880 so fast Pro tip but so we were looking
01:07:17.559 at um a media buyer for one of our
01:07:19.160 portfolio companies and I and I think
01:07:22.839 the you know they they passed a number
01:07:24.559 of candidates and they were like this is
01:07:25.559 is the final guy we want you to talk to
01:07:27.079 him so I said fine so I talked to the
01:07:28.520 candidate and the guy was great nothing
01:07:31.880 wrong with him seemed you know had had
01:07:33.799 decent experience and when I got off the
01:07:36.000 call I I got the recruiter from my team
01:07:38.319 was like hey so what you what you think
01:07:39.599 should I should I pass him along or
01:07:40.760 should we hire him and I was like I
01:07:42.680 don't think so he's like why he's like
01:07:44.559 he met all the all the requirements he
01:07:46.160 had the experience he seemed like a nice
01:07:47.559 guy and I thought about it more and I
01:07:48.880 was like name the other people on that
01:07:50.279 team so he named all the other people
01:07:51.839 and I said is that guy better than any
01:07:53.520 of them and he was like No And I was
01:07:55.359 like then we're making the company worse
01:07:57.720 and so that person has to raise the bar
01:08:00.039 of that team because think about the
01:08:01.640 equal opposite if every person that
01:08:03.039 comes in lowers the bar of the team you
01:08:05.039 eventually dilute the company to a bunch
01:08:06.599 of people who suck but if you maintain
01:08:09.079 that bar which is that this person has
01:08:10.799 to increase the average of the team then
01:08:12.559 over time a company only improves and
01:08:14.279 gets better and as that person now is in
01:08:16.600 the team the whole the whole team's bar
01:08:18.960 now raised a little bit and so when we
01:08:20.279 bring someone else in the bar goes up
01:08:22.198 and if you're like wait that means that
01:08:23.319 I have to keep hiring better and better
01:08:24.600 people you damn stra you do that's the
01:08:26.799 whole point and a mentor of mine said
01:08:28.359 this and I just loved this quote he said
01:08:29.640 your best talent has yet to come your
01:08:32.080 best talent is in the future you haven't
01:08:34.198 met them yet and so in me thinking about
01:08:36.960 this and I can pass that same advice
01:08:38.439 along to you is that the best employees
01:08:40.040 the best teammates the best partners are
01:08:42.359 in your future not your past number 19
01:08:44.479 when you're dealing with that team
01:08:45.960 there's five reasons that someone is not
01:08:48.279 doing what you want them to do and this
01:08:49.560 is super helpful for these hard
01:08:51.000 conversations and I usually draw a
01:08:52.799 diamond here but I'll just do it
01:08:54.479 visually here's the condition someone
01:08:56.279 hasn't done what you want them to do
01:08:57.759 reason number one they didn't know that
01:08:59.238 you wanted them to do it so you didn't
01:09:00.799 communicate it clearly or you didn't do
01:09:02.080 it in a written fashion whatever it was
01:09:03.719 there was a miscommunication they didn't
01:09:04.839 know that you wanted them to do it okay
01:09:06.880 now let's say they knew that you wanted
01:09:08.319 them to do it the second reason is they
01:09:10.000 didn't know how to do it if they didn't
01:09:11.799 know how to do it then it means that
01:09:12.880 they need to be trained on the steps in
01:09:14.960 order to recreate that thing now once
01:09:17.238 you train them if they know that you
01:09:19.000 want to do it and they know how to do it
01:09:20.679 then they might not have know when you
01:09:22.120 wanted to do it which means you needed
01:09:23.359 to add a deadline or a timeline with the
01:09:25.640 thing that you asked them to do so it's
01:09:27.000 like oh I knew that I just know you
01:09:28.120 needed buy Tuesday okay great so we're
01:09:30.560 working our way around the fourth reason
01:09:32.520 that someone won't do it is because they
01:09:34.080 know that you wanted them to do it they
01:09:35.920 knew how to do it and they knew when you
01:09:37.439 wanted them to do it but they just
01:09:39.040 didn't want to do it so they weren't
01:09:40.839 motivated and with motivation obviously
01:09:44.000 a massive topic a lot of it comes down
01:09:45.839 to the reward cycles and Punishment
01:09:47.080 Cycles associated with the work that
01:09:48.399 they do and so it's how can I incentive
01:09:50.238 them incentivize them properly and not
01:09:52.158 necessarily monetarily you can
01:09:53.719 incentivize someone by Praise
01:09:55.920 and by giving them Kudos you want to
01:09:57.360 know something that really incentivizes
01:09:59.040 people freedom and reinvesting in them
01:10:01.600 if you want your team to love you give
01:10:03.239 them autonomy and invest in them if you
01:10:05.800 do that they're like holy cow I get so
01:10:07.679 much investment from these people
01:10:08.840 basically what you want is you want
01:10:10.719 reciprocity to still be like if the only
01:10:13.679 reason someone does something is for the
01:10:15.360 paycheck you're going to miss out on the
01:10:17.120 vast majority of human effort which is
01:10:18.880 discretionary effort so let's say it
01:10:21.040 takes this much effort to not get fired
01:10:23.239 someone usually has 10 times that amount
01:10:25.159 of effort available to them that they
01:10:27.320 put to their Hobbies they put to their
01:10:29.000 other things they put to their shower
01:10:30.640 time they put to music or whatever else
01:10:32.520 but they're not putting it to their role
01:10:34.280 and reinvesting in it but if you invest
01:10:36.120 in them and you try and uplevel their
01:10:38.080 skill set either as a human being or as
01:10:39.800 a professional or both then they become
01:10:42.239 more valuable in your business and I
01:10:43.679 think about it this way it's like well
01:10:44.960 what if I invest in them and they leave
01:10:46.480 well it's what if you don't and they
01:10:47.719 stay so that's the fourth reason so they
01:10:49.360 know that you want to do it they know
01:10:51.199 how to do it they know when they want it
01:10:53.199 done by and they're motivated to do it
01:10:54.560 well why why still or they haven't done
01:10:56.000 it they have something blocking them and
01:10:58.280 so an easy analogy here is I could have
01:10:59.800 the best chef in the world in the most
01:11:01.000 amazing kitchen and I would say hey make
01:11:02.880 me an omelet and if he knows how to make
01:11:04.679 an omelette and he knows and he knows I
01:11:06.440 want it right now in front of me and
01:11:08.159 he's motivated to do it because he's on
01:11:09.640 television but he's like I don't have
01:11:11.320 eggs there's nothing he's not going to
01:11:13.360  an egg out right there's nothing
01:11:14.719 he's going to do and I'll tell you a
01:11:15.640 real world example of this so my imunity
01:11:17.480 team uh we spending a lot of so we have
01:11:19.280 a big office and we built a Hu a bunch
01:11:21.360 of Studio stuff invested almost a
01:11:23.080 million dollars into this building just
01:11:24.560 on the media side to make it awesome for
01:11:26.719 them but a lot of the guys were spending
01:11:28.600 their time at home editing stuff and I
01:11:30.960 was like dude what the hell I was like I
01:11:32.280 think we've made this a pretty sweet
01:11:33.480 place like why not you know what it was
01:11:35.440 the bandwidth on upload speed was low at
01:11:37.600 the office and so their houses were
01:11:40.440 higher or faster upload speeds and so it
01:11:42.280 was it was making them way less
01:11:43.840 efficient which kudos to them for being
01:11:46.040 more efficient by being at home but then
01:11:48.120 I was like okay well this is obviously
01:11:49.800 constraint and so then we spent 120
01:11:52.040 Grand to get Google Fiber drilled
01:11:53.560 through the floor not through the floor
01:11:55.040 like from the road to get brought into
01:11:57.000 the building and now we've upload speeds
01:11:58.719 of 1.2 gigs a second and so now we're
01:12:02.600 way faster than they were at home and
01:12:04.120 guess what the media team's here and so
01:12:06.400 that was the thing that was blocking
01:12:07.719 them and so here's the cool thing about
01:12:09.560 this framework is that if you have a
01:12:11.440 hard conversation with somebody or you
01:12:13.159 perceive it to be a hard conversation
01:12:14.520 because they're not doing something that
01:12:15.600 you want them to do you can say I think
01:12:17.520 there's five reasons that someone
01:12:18.719 doesn't do it let's walk through them
01:12:20.159 together and that way you can attack the
01:12:21.719 reason rather than the person number 20
01:12:24.480 the hardest work work is the work that
01:12:26.080 you don't know how to do and the reason
01:12:28.880 this is so tough is that the vast
01:12:31.400 majority of the time if I said what
01:12:33.199 would it take to grow your business if
01:12:34.560 you only had one thing you could do by
01:12:36.080 the end of the year and make sure that
01:12:37.360 it was accomplished that if you just did
01:12:39.320 that one thing all of your other goals
01:12:41.600 would get accomplished what would that
01:12:42.760 one thing be by the way that one thing
01:12:45.159 is what we call a priority now the thing
01:12:47.920 is is that you might not know how to
01:12:49.719 make that one thing happen so it could
01:12:51.440 be if I had a mega brand by the end of
01:12:53.920 the year all of my other issues would go
01:12:55.679 away it could be if I didn't have the
01:12:57.520 turn issue that I have by the end of the
01:12:59.159 year all my other issues would go away
01:13:01.639 if I had a good sales director that
01:13:02.920 could scale of sales team all of my
01:13:04.520 issues would go away many businesses
01:13:06.679 have one thing that if you think about
01:13:08.120 it long enough have enough Downstream
01:13:10.000 effects that it would accomplish many of
01:13:12.120 these other goals that you have or more
01:13:14.159 likely make them irrelevant and so what
01:13:16.920 we do often times as entrepreneur is we
01:13:19.239 solve the problems we already know how
01:13:20.719 to solve and so we like doing those
01:13:22.600 because we have fast feedback loops
01:13:24.120 because it's rewarding because we you
01:13:25.159 know how to solve it and so it's
01:13:26.280 basically like going back to level two
01:13:28.320 when you're at level three and you don't
01:13:29.920 know how to beat that boss you just keep
01:13:31.400 beating level two again because it feels
01:13:33.080 good but the thing is is that the level
01:13:34.560 three boss hasn't changed and he's still
01:13:36.360 sitting there Bowser you know with his
01:13:38.760 fist and his spikes sitting there ready
01:13:41.280 to wreck you and so the thing is is that
01:13:43.400 the hard work of Entrepreneurship is the
01:13:45.840 failure that you're inevitably going to
01:13:48.080 encounter by not knowing what you're
01:13:50.280 doing and then taking action steps
01:13:52.719 despite that with the idea that you will
01:13:55.639 eventually succeed if you don't stop and
01:13:58.280 so we as entrepreneurs have to accept
01:14:00.920 that that is what hard feels like it is
01:14:02.679 confronting the unknown that we don't
01:14:04.880 know how to do and realizing that we're
01:14:06.639 going to take our best shot and probably
01:14:08.560 be wrong four five six times in a row
01:14:11.760 and yet that single priority has not
01:14:14.080 changed if we still built the Big Brand
01:14:16.320 if we still hired that really good sales
01:14:17.960 director if we still fixed churn in our
01:14:20.199 business if that thing were solved it
01:14:22.320 still doesn't become less of a priority
01:14:24.280 but what happens is the entrepreneur
01:14:26.120 fails once fails twice and then decides
01:14:28.639 you know what I'm going to go back to
01:14:29.719 level two and beat that to feed my ego
01:14:31.639 to feel good about myself but most of
01:14:33.760 Entrepreneurship is eating glass and
01:14:35.360 that's why I said earlier growth is
01:14:37.040 stressful stagnation is stressful
01:14:38.440 decline is stressful because in each of
01:14:40.120 those scenarios you're still doing the
01:14:41.920 same thing which is that you're solving
01:14:43.320 a problem you don't know how to solve
01:14:44.760 yet and so the actual doing this in all
01:14:47.080 three of those scenarios is the same and
01:14:49.600 so that's why when you want to when you
01:14:51.239 want to say stress is the problem it's
01:14:53.080 not the problem stress is a fact that
01:14:55.360 occurs when you solve problems and if
01:14:57.520 you're solving problems you don't know
01:14:58.800 how to solve welcome to the game if you
01:15:01.360 knew how to do everything you'd already
01:15:03.040 be Elon Musk and so the whole journey of
01:15:06.040 Entrepreneurship is turning the unknown
01:15:08.360 into the known through trial and error
01:15:10.120 there's a company that was thinking
01:15:11.040 about investing in that has a consumer
01:15:12.840 package good cpg product that I asked
01:15:16.239 the founder I said how hard is this to
01:15:18.040 manufacture and he said it's actually a
01:15:20.040 lot more complicated than I thought it
01:15:21.520 would be and I was like that's amazing
01:15:23.280 and he just looked at me cross-eyed and
01:15:24.560 he was like why is that amazing I was
01:15:26.520 like because that's more things that
01:15:28.920 anyone who's going to try and copy us is
01:15:30.440 going to have to overcome and if we can
01:15:32.360 bet on the fact that we're more
01:15:33.800 perspicacious that we're more Relentless
01:15:35.639 that we're more unyielding in our desire
01:15:38.639 to keep solving the problem and keep
01:15:40.400 bashing our heads against The Rock until
01:15:42.480 the rock gives way then we will be able
01:15:44.960 to be the winners and any single thing
01:15:47.320 that you have to overcome to be
01:15:48.960 successful is what anybody who behind
01:15:51.400 you wants to compete with you will also
01:15:53.480 have to solve and so I like to think
01:15:55.400 about it like there's this big rock that
01:15:57.639 I have to figure out how to move with
01:15:59.639 rope and some duct tape and a lot of
01:16:01.719 sweat and a few guys with me and on the
01:16:03.800 other side of that rock is a big bag of
01:16:05.800 money and the bigger the Rock in general
01:16:08.080 the bigger the bag of money I mean I use
01:16:09.679 this Frame all the time at one of our
01:16:11.159 other portfolio companies we have a
01:16:12.600 software uh that we've developed and has
01:16:14.560 now gotten really really good and is
01:16:15.719 generating a lot of Revenue and there's
01:16:17.639 this next big feature that we have to
01:16:19.040 build out and he's like this is going to
01:16:20.040 be really complicated I said well the
01:16:21.400 good news is we're going to get paid
01:16:22.400 $150 million when we solve it and he was
01:16:24.960 was like well when you say it like that
01:16:26.000 and I was like well it is like that and
01:16:27.960 so when you think about these things
01:16:29.520 whether it's I need to add a second uh
01:16:31.280 acquisition Channel or I need to learn
01:16:32.719 how to hire manage and train a sales
01:16:35.440 director each of these are hard things
01:16:37.520 that you have to figure out how to do
01:16:38.920 but if you can quantify how much more
01:16:41.080 valuable your Enterprise or your
01:16:42.440 business will be as a result of this
01:16:44.120 change then you can ascribe a value to
01:16:46.440 it and if I said hey man if you hire
01:16:48.560 that sales director I'll pay you $5
01:16:50.239 million guess how motivated You'
01:16:52.080 probably be more motivated but the thing
01:16:54.120 is is that your business business will
01:16:55.320 pay you $5 million when you solve the
01:16:56.960 problem and so if you frame it that way
01:16:58.560 it stops being this wo as me people are
01:17:00.679 hard uh man life is stressful it's we
01:17:03.600 get compensated for our ability to deal
01:17:05.040 with that stress and take action despite
01:17:06.960 it one of the biggest unknowns that I
01:17:08.719 had when I started a few years ago is
01:17:10.040 how do you run a family office so I went
01:17:12.000 from an entrepreneur building businesses
01:17:14.320 to I have to manage cash at a portfolio
01:17:19.440 and allocations of resources in capital
01:17:22.679 across multiple businesses and different
01:17:24.320 Industries how many resources do I
01:17:26.320 allocate in terms of man- hours to each
01:17:27.719 of these companies is it proportional to
01:17:29.560 the capital what kind of deal structures
01:17:31.600 are going to be the things that are
01:17:32.440 going to mitigate risk but also give us
01:17:33.760 the most upside these are all these
01:17:35.360 things that I had no experience with and
01:17:37.360 so I just got on the phone with anybody
01:17:38.960 who would give me time and asked them as
01:17:40.199 many questions I possibly could and then
01:17:41.880 guess what happened once I started doing
01:17:43.719 it I learned way more than I did from
01:17:45.440 all of those conversations and I
01:17:46.639 developed my own thesis of how this
01:17:48.440 works and so the thing is is that every
01:17:51.000 time you start on something new whether
01:17:52.480 it's starting a business to begin with
01:17:53.800 OR learning how to run unpaid ads or
01:17:55.880 learning how to sell it always feels
01:17:57.480 like this big amorphous thing but once
01:17:59.719 you take your first phone sale once you
01:18:01.880 run your first ad once you hire your
01:18:04.239 first person all of a sudden you're like
01:18:06.840 oh okay I kind of wrapped my arms around
01:18:09.520 it and now I can see all the holes that
01:18:10.920 are there and so in my experience the
01:18:13.080 faster I can get to me just wrapping my
01:18:14.800 arms around me actually taking the first
01:18:16.719 action you'll learn a hundred times more
01:18:19.440 from your first hundred phone sales than
01:18:21.679 you will from 10,000 hours of reading
01:18:23.960 books about it and so my goal with a lot
01:18:26.480 of the content that I have here is if I
01:18:27.719 can just shrink the time between you
01:18:29.080 thinking about doing it and doing it the
01:18:31.120 faster you're going to get to your goal
01:18:32.480 because learning is same condition new
01:18:35.320 Behavior if you have not changed your
01:18:38.560 conditions and your behavior Remains the
01:18:40.360 Same after this video you have learned
01:18:42.360 nothing and you can measure how
01:18:44.560 intelligent someone is by their rate of
01:18:46.400 learning which means by the rate at
01:18:48.159 which they change their behavior with
01:18:49.639 given a the same stimulus so if I say
01:18:52.840 hey pick up the phone and answer it
01:18:54.440 someone picks up the phone they say blah
01:18:55.760 blah blah I say great I want you to read
01:18:57.480 the script now pick up the phone now
01:18:59.440 they pick up the phone they read the
01:19:00.520 script same condition new Behavior
01:19:02.920 they've learned and so right now in your
01:19:04.920 life there are conditions that probably
01:19:07.520 remain unchanged and so if your behavior
01:19:11.000 does not change you learned nothing and
01:19:13.360 you can measure every video every piece
01:19:15.440 of content every book that you or every
01:19:18.040 sales exchange every meeting you have as
01:19:20.639 to will this change my behavior if it
01:19:23.480 didn't it was a waste of time and if
01:19:25.719 you're a younger guy and you're just
01:19:27.320 getting started like you don't have a
01:19:28.840 business I don't make as much content
01:19:30.639 anymore for people who are getting
01:19:31.679 started but if that is you I just made a
01:19:34.719 video called uh brutally honest advice
01:19:36.760 to my younger self uh check it out I
01:19:39.280 think you'll enjoy it and it might help
01:19:40.480 you get started and change your behavior
