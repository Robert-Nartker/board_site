# https://www.youtube.com/watch/afbP6sB_Atc

00:00:00.040 wasting money sucks and in 6 months I
00:00:03.080 saved one of our portfolio companies $2
00:00:05.120 million in bottom line profit and I'm
00:00:07.480 going to show you the problems they were
00:00:08.599 suffering from the solutions we did and
00:00:10.599 takeaways you can use in your business
00:00:12.639 today to increase customer satisfaction
00:00:15.080 decrease refunds get more people to buy
00:00:17.480 your next thing or upsell and decrease
00:00:20.240 the dreaded charge back enjoy so this
00:00:22.439 business was a SAS business which just
00:00:24.119 stands for software as a service and we
00:00:26.519 had just implemented this software in
00:00:28.960 the business 90 days earlier and so we
00:00:31.039 had a big spike in churn decreased
00:00:33.920 customer satisfaction scores decreased
00:00:35.440 number of people who are taking the next
00:00:36.480 upsell and other problems and so the
00:00:38.800 first problem that we wanted to attack
00:00:41.800 was onboarding meaning what does a
00:00:44.760 customer do immediately after they buy
00:00:47.280 now if you don't have onboarding I can
00:00:48.960 tell you right now if you add onboarding
00:00:50.960 you will significantly make customers
00:00:52.559 happier and you'll get them to stay
00:00:53.760 longer and pay more so if you're not
00:00:55.399 doing it start there now let me tell you
00:00:57.640 the problems with the onboarding is it
00:00:58.960 currently existed so within onboarding
00:01:01.199 there were five main problems and I'm
00:01:02.640 going to start with the first one first
00:01:04.519 off it was one to many so there were 25
00:01:07.040 new customers per call so you imagine
00:01:09.080 you buy this thing you get an email they
00:01:11.159 say hey schedule your onboarding call
00:01:12.920 you schedule the call you hop on and
00:01:14.360 then you're like wait there's a whole
00:01:15.159 bunch of other people here and then when
00:01:16.880 you're on the call the actual stuff that
00:01:18.880 they were going over was really Broad
00:01:20.720 and kind of company based it was like
00:01:22.680 this is our mission this is our vision
00:01:24.280 this is what we're trying to do these
00:01:25.320 are our Founders this is our story all
00:01:27.439 the stuff that customers don't care
00:01:29.320 about next uh from a value perspective
00:01:32.840 they were having to do like a third of
00:01:34.960 the call was helping people like reset
00:01:36.799 their passwords for the software because
00:01:39.320 they couldn't figure it out this is an
00:01:40.840 older demo which I'll talk about a
00:01:42.640 little bit later uh so this is a 55 plus
00:01:45.960 average demo Avatar meaning these are
00:01:48.759 older folks who are doing a technology
00:01:50.920 business so we need to have way more
00:01:53.079 handholding I'm already sh a little bit
00:01:54.439 of some solutioning all right so they
00:01:56.840 were spending all their time resetting
00:01:58.640 passwords and talking about really broad
00:02:00.680 stuff and at the very end of that one to
00:02:03.399 many call they were then kind of hard
00:02:05.439 pitching the upsell right and so if
00:02:08.560 someone didn't take that offer there was
00:02:11.280 no next steps for them to take so it's
00:02:13.800 basically like hey you bought this thing
00:02:15.599 hey we're going to tell you about the
00:02:16.560 company oh yeah let's spend a third of
00:02:19.040 this call helping individual people fix
00:02:20.720 their individual passwords and then at
00:02:22.440 the end hey you should buy our next
00:02:23.760 thing and people say well I don't want
00:02:25.400 to buy that and then they say good luck
00:02:27.599 this is a big company and in some ways
00:02:29.360 you can take says if you do the right
00:02:32.160 things right you can still get a lot of
00:02:33.840 things wrong and be successful and this
00:02:36.560 is a new product and so I want to
00:02:38.239 highlight this is that especially if you
00:02:39.680 have a large customer base and you start
00:02:41.159 a new thing you're usually going to have
00:02:42.760 a huge on you know inflow in the
00:02:44.680 beginning that causes your
00:02:46.400 infrastructure to break because if you
00:02:48.239 were to sustain that level of sales flow
00:02:51.319 as then you get thousands of customers
00:02:52.920 to all start every day then your
00:02:54.040 infrastructure would be bigger but it
00:02:55.360 doesn't make sense to hire a 100 reps
00:02:58.200 just for 3 days and then fire them all
00:03:00.360 and so some of these problems are due to
00:03:03.239 scale and the nature of releasing a new
00:03:05.400 product in general lots of large
00:03:06.840 companies have it happened that's why
00:03:08.200 there's lines out the door at Apple
00:03:09.760 that's the idea okay so that was series
00:03:12.280 of problems number one if you have a
00:03:14.040 service or you have a software notice
00:03:16.080 how they're very similar onboarding is
00:03:18.080 the first real touch point with the
00:03:19.599 customer and customers make their first
00:03:22.080 impression of your business from the 24
00:03:24.400 to 48 hours post purchase meaning
00:03:27.159 everything that happens until then
00:03:28.680 frames the entire rest of their
00:03:30.599 experience with you and so nailing that
00:03:33.200 next 24 48 hours will increase how many
00:03:36.480 people take your upsells how long they
00:03:38.519 stay so literally like adding onboarding
00:03:40.439 can add 2 three months to your LTV if
00:03:42.720 you have any kind of recurring service
00:03:44.239 and so right now if you're not doing it
00:03:45.640 or just sending like an email with some
00:03:47.120 lists on it you're missing a massive
00:03:49.439 Revenue opportunity so the first thing
00:03:51.200 we did to fix this onboarding process
00:03:53.000 was we ran a pilot so to be clear we
00:03:55.000 didn't say hey let's break the entire
00:03:57.200 business yet again so we took 15% of new
00:03:59.799 customers and put them through a
00:04:01.000 different onboarding process to test
00:04:03.159 whether this new onboarding process
00:04:04.840 yielded better results than the current
00:04:06.360 one so what we did was we went from one
00:04:08.159 to many to one onone now obviously part
00:04:12.400 of the reason that we rolled this out
00:04:13.640 slowly was because we didn't have the
00:04:15.280 bandwidth to take on 25 new customers
00:04:18.079 every hour which is what we were doing
00:04:19.759 here we had one person doing six or
00:04:21.600 eight calls with 25 customers each every
00:04:24.960 single day and so to scale that team it
00:04:27.440 would have taken a lot of time and we
00:04:28.600 definitely weren't going to risk it
00:04:29.960 until we've proven it out so that's the
00:04:31.600 first thing we did the second thing we
00:04:33.280 did in the pilot is we actually followed
00:04:35.280 the closer framework which is a sales
00:04:37.120 framework like wait how does that apply
00:04:39.080 to onboarding well guess what once
00:04:41.000 someone makes a purchase the last R of
00:04:43.280 closer is reinforce the decision and so
00:04:45.520 that actually applies to onboarding and
00:04:48.120 so when you reinforce the decision what
00:04:50.199 we do is restate the c l and O again so
00:04:53.360 we say hey clarify why they're there
00:04:55.479 label them with a problem and then
00:04:57.120 overview their past experience and then
00:04:58.720 you're selling them again on the
00:05:00.560 vacation on what they're going to
00:05:02.120 experience as a result of their past
00:05:04.840 decision of buying now from a value
00:05:07.800 perspective first off establishing the
00:05:10.320 goal and reminding them of the goal that
00:05:12.400 they had is massive and so I want to
00:05:14.840 like look at you in the camera right now
00:05:16.120 when we had Allen our software company
00:05:18.080 and we simply changed the language that
00:05:20.880 we onboarded people with so we actually
00:05:22.560 had a similar onboarding process but we
00:05:24.960 just said hey I know you said you wanted
00:05:26.759 to make $10,000 a month extra with your
00:05:28.479 agency or whatever but why do you want
00:05:30.880 that now they say oh well I want to make
00:05:32.800 this impact or I want to retire my wife
00:05:34.360 or I want to whatever the thing is when
00:05:36.160 we related them taking the next steps to
00:05:39.639 the goal that they had stated it doubled
00:05:42.120 or tripled I can't remember the number
00:05:43.680 it was a lot how many more people
00:05:45.759 followed through because we said we want
00:05:47.840 to help you with that John we want to
00:05:49.560 help you retire your wife and these next
00:05:51.560 three things are going to help you do
00:05:52.960 that and then they were like oh that's
00:05:55.160 the reason I signed up and I am going to
00:05:56.759 follow through from the low value
00:05:58.880 version of this where I was like let me
00:06:00.319 just listen to everybody resetting their
00:06:01.720 passwords we could give someone a
00:06:03.560 one-on-one coner experience of walking
00:06:05.600 them through setting up their password
00:06:07.000 correctly because is a very low
00:06:08.560 technically proficient audience that we
00:06:10.240 were dealing with so we would get them a
00:06:11.800 quick win so if this is you for your
00:06:13.840 business you want the quick
00:06:18.560 win which was getting their login set up
00:06:21.440 properly and showing them around the
00:06:23.280 software now here's the interesting part
00:06:26.319 if for whatever reason something came up
00:06:28.800 during the on on boarding call we would
00:06:30.840 immediately connect them with support so
00:06:32.479 we could get it handled on that call and
00:06:34.880 so that way at the end of every call for
00:06:36.919 onboarding the people were live they
00:06:38.880 were set up they were logged in and they
00:06:41.479 understood the basics of how to use the
00:06:43.319 software to get the goal that they
00:06:45.360 signed up for part of you is like wait
00:06:47.319 so you did the one: one you added the
00:06:49.840 Clos in the front of this you got a
00:06:51.759 quick win for them okay but what about
00:06:53.800 the sales like this is cute Alex but
00:06:56.000 what about the money I know I'm just a
00:06:57.720 bleeding heart and doesn't don't want to
00:06:59.199 make money
00:07:00.039 uh no I'm here to make money I'm an
00:07:02.520 investor I own this company I want this
00:07:03.599 to go big right so what we did and this
00:07:05.960 is the interesting part if you already
00:07:07.639 are a business owner and you like this
00:07:09.039 more in-depth stuff we have workshops
00:07:10.680 that we just started uh offering at
00:07:12.080 acquisition. comom at our headquarters
00:07:13.440 in Vegas um and so if you want to see if
00:07:15.360 you qualify for one of those uh you can
00:07:17.039 go to acquisition. comom hit scale
00:07:18.759 hopefully we'll talk to you then is that
00:07:20.080 we found that when we had this
00:07:21.400 one-on-one experience that restated the
00:07:23.199 goals and all this stuff guess what
00:07:24.960 happened we went from
00:07:27.160 20% of people ascending from from the
00:07:29.759 old process to
00:07:32.919 48% of people taking the Ascension offer
00:07:36.560 so this is one of the things that has
00:07:38.000 taken me a very long time to learn which
00:07:40.800 is when you're persuading a big part of
00:07:44.159 the value equation and if you don't know
00:07:45.840 the value equation four variables dream
00:07:47.440 outcome perceive likel of achievement
00:07:49.360 time delay effort and
00:07:51.599 sacrifice how dialed and how tight your
00:07:54.879 business is before you ask for money is
00:07:58.680 a huge
00:08:00.520 boost to the perceived likelihood of
00:08:02.680 achievement and so if everything that
00:08:04.759 I've said to you up to this point I've
00:08:06.680 overd delivered on and I've delivered on
00:08:09.360 time and made an exceptional experience
00:08:11.520 for you and I've given you the quick
00:08:12.639 wins I reminded you while you were here
00:08:14.039 you've got somebody one1 who's got your
00:08:15.280 full attention then when I make the next
00:08:17.400 offer you feel like it's very likely
00:08:19.800 that I'm going to continue to do
00:08:21.800 business the same way I already have and
00:08:24.199 so the best way to get someone to expect
00:08:26.080 that they're going to get value in the
00:08:27.159 future is provide value today so the
00:08:29.520 tldr is we didn't need to be nearly as
00:08:32.000 sales heavy because the quality of the
00:08:34.080 service was so much higher that they
00:08:35.799 said yeah if this is a taste of what I'm
00:08:37.559 going to get later I want way more of
00:08:39.599 that and let me give you a pro tip right
00:08:41.799 now if you're not sure what to upsell on
00:08:45.600 the back of anything there are two
00:08:47.720 upsells that work in almost any business
00:08:50.320 that I buy and I've seen across the
00:08:51.920 zillions that I look at more of that
00:08:54.360 thing you just bought or more help with
00:08:56.760 that thing you just bought so people
00:08:59.040 bought a thing and if you're like why I
00:09:00.600 don't want to upsell them immediately
00:09:02.000 well they bought it so they probably
00:09:03.519 want more of it or they want more help
00:09:04.800 with that thing they just bought and so
00:09:06.320 you can get
00:09:07.519 huge uptakes on UPS sales immediately
00:09:11.920 after someone makes a first purchase let
00:09:13.519 me give you a little tip so most small
00:09:14.959 business owners are afraid of asking for
00:09:17.000 too much right they're like hey this
00:09:18.399 person just bought for me I don't want
00:09:19.920 to seem pushy I don't want to make more
00:09:21.720 offers but if you believe in what you
00:09:24.120 sell and someone has a problem then it's
00:09:26.240 my belief that you have an ethical duty
00:09:27.680 to present them the offer you don't have
00:09:29.680 to hard close them but you should let
00:09:31.720 them know that you've made this offer or
00:09:34.240 this solution available to them because
00:09:36.440 buying the way most people think about
00:09:38.079 it is that people buy on these regular
00:09:40.160 intervals but that's actually not the
00:09:42.079 case at all what happens is someone has
00:09:44.000 a problem and then in a very short
00:09:46.720 period of time they make all their
00:09:48.839 purchases and then they make almost none
00:09:52.000 so think about it this way if I wanted
00:09:54.000 to start running a marathon what would I
00:09:56.200 do I'd sign up for a marathon and then
00:09:57.680 I'd be like oh shoot I need Marathon
00:09:59.480 shoes so then I go to the shoe store and
00:10:00.920 buy Marathon shoes and I be like you
00:10:02.160 know what I don't have any running
00:10:03.839 shorts I only have the shorts that are
00:10:05.000 basketball shorts so I need to get some
00:10:06.360 running shorts so I buy running shorts
00:10:08.079 then i' be like I gotta go one of those
00:10:09.120 tank tops okay oh you know what I have
00:10:10.839 an iPod but I don't have an arm sleeve
00:10:12.240 for it so it's going to fall out oh are
00:10:13.920 there headphones that are better for
00:10:15.000 running so it doesn't fall out of my
00:10:16.200 head now the small business owner most
00:10:19.279 people watching this say wait I only
00:10:22.120 sell shoes I don't want to offer them
00:10:24.360 shorts and a tank top and headphones but
00:10:27.200 guess what Susie's going to do she's
00:10:29.360 going to go take all of this after you
00:10:31.120 made the hard sale of getting her to
00:10:32.640 sign up for a marathon and she's going
00:10:34.160 to go to the guy down the street because
00:10:35.880 he's a real business owner and he's like
00:10:37.720 hey she's in a buying window she's in a
00:10:40.120 hyper buying frenzy and we need to
00:10:42.320 capitalize on it in that moment now How
00:10:44.320 likely is it after she's bought all that
00:10:46.200 stuff now Adam the average business
00:10:48.360 owner he's like hey now that you've been
00:10:50.480 running for 30 days do you want an iPod
00:10:53.040 case and she's like well dude I've been
00:10:54.560 running for 30 days I already got it
00:10:56.120 from uh above average Andrew down the
00:10:59.760 street he already sold me all the stuff
00:11:01.120 I need thanks and guess where she's
00:11:03.040 going to go from here on out the guy who
00:11:05.360 sold her the most stuff most businesses
00:11:07.440 have some sort of shift that happens in
00:11:09.240 someone's identity when they make a
00:11:10.480 purchase they say I'm an author now I'm
00:11:12.560 an investor now I'm a runner now I'm a
00:11:14.800 marketer now I'm a whatever insert the
00:11:17.279 thing that you help some I'm healthy now
00:11:19.160 I'm a fitness person now you have these
00:11:21.399 transitions where someone steps into a
00:11:22.959 new identity and then there's all these
00:11:24.760 other behaviors and other products that
00:11:26.639 go along with that identity and so we
00:11:28.959 want to explain that and enable our
00:11:32.240 customers to buy those thing from us the
00:11:35.120 moment they make that decision because
00:11:37.279 it actually is more congruent with what
00:11:39.760 you set in the expectations if I said
00:11:41.480 hey I'm going to help you become a
00:11:42.160 marathon runner and then I only have
00:11:44.320 shoes to sell them then I probably
00:11:46.440 didn't really believe that much in the
00:11:48.000 fact that they were really becoming a
00:11:49.399 marathon runner so they now believe you
00:11:52.040 you've sold them on this dream this new
00:11:53.839 identity they could get into back it up
00:11:56.399 so we've already made some massive
00:11:57.639 improvements to this onboarding process
00:11:59.480 but what's the last thing we did well
00:12:01.160 before this there was no next steps we
00:12:03.040 were like sayara hope you buy again in
00:12:05.720 the future and if not you're dead to us
00:12:07.440 not really I say that to exaggerate but
00:12:09.360 there's three things we did to improve
00:12:11.279 this last part so the first thing we did
00:12:13.360 was we gave them a summary of the
00:12:15.839 experience and we let them know in the
00:12:17.160 beginning hey don't worry you don't have
00:12:18.880 to take notes we're taking notes for you
00:12:20.880 and we're going to send them to you at
00:12:22.480 the end of this call that way you can be
00:12:24.399 fully present and paying attention and
00:12:25.880 that way you can think about the
00:12:26.720 questions you could that you want to ask
00:12:28.199 while I'm here than being worried of
00:12:29.959 like oh I didn't get that so number one
00:12:32.040 puts them at ease two they're going to
00:12:33.680 get all the best notes because we're
00:12:35.120 going to take notes for them the second
00:12:37.240 thing is we gave them tutorials and so
00:12:39.600 say Hey you are interested in these
00:12:41.920 components of our software because not
00:12:43.240 all customers want the same things from
00:12:44.639 your service or your product you say
00:12:46.240 okay you're especially interested in
00:12:48.079 these three items cool so what I'm going
00:12:50.480 to do on top of walking you through it
00:12:52.320 right now is I'm actually going to give
00:12:53.560 you a link to these three tutorials in
00:12:55.720 those notes that I send you that way you
00:12:57.680 can refer back to them without me
00:12:59.600 necessarily having to click through it
00:13:00.680 again uh so that if you get stuck you
00:13:02.399 can just follow along but it's specific
00:13:04.360 to the things that that person said
00:13:06.440 clarify whether they label them with a
00:13:07.959 problem in the beginning of the call
00:13:09.720 that was aligned with their goal the
00:13:11.320 third thing we did was okay we've given
00:13:13.399 you the notes we're giving you the
00:13:14.680 how-tos and if for whatever reason you
00:13:16.959 have a problem we give you a point of
00:13:18.360 contact so you've got a PC you've got a
00:13:20.199 point of contact that this person that
00:13:21.680 I'm going to introduce you to live on
00:13:23.560 the call so you make FaceTime you
00:13:25.680 understand who it is and now from this
00:13:27.040 point going forward this is called a
00:13:28.440 Baton Pass and so if you think about
00:13:30.519 this from a business no one should ever
00:13:33.360 fall into no man's land so this is what
00:13:35.959 we like to call bamfam and I got this
00:13:38.160 from Chiron svat is a good friend of
00:13:39.639 mine which is bamfam is book a meeting
00:13:42.320 from a meeting bamfam is a way of life
00:13:44.680 no customer should ever not be bam Pam
00:13:47.560 they should always know when the next
00:13:49.160 time they're going to talk to you is
00:13:50.480 never get off a call being like yeah
00:13:52.000 yeah and then we'll coordinate the next
00:13:53.240 thing you're both there pull up your
00:13:55.399 calendars pick the time get it done now
00:13:58.680 with bam famam that means that the sales
00:14:01.480 guy hands the Baton over to the
00:14:02.920 onboarding person they know when they're
00:14:04.560 going to be talking to them then the
00:14:06.199 onboarding person baton passes to the
00:14:08.040 support person or the account rep who's
00:14:09.759 going to be managing the account on the
00:14:11.199 ongoing basis and so at all times notice
00:14:13.800 three different people touched the
00:14:15.480 account but at no point did they have
00:14:17.839 multiple points of contact so we had
00:14:20.199 multiple people who touched them but in
00:14:21.920 the beginning it's sales rep John and
00:14:24.040 then next one it's onboarding Oly and
00:14:26.560 then it's account rep Alex right and so
00:14:29.160 every point that person knows who
00:14:30.360 they're going to talk to until that
00:14:31.639 person hands the Baton to the next
00:14:33.120 person so the second bucket of problems
00:14:35.040 was expectations and so one thing people
00:14:37.880 said was this is way too techy I thought
00:14:40.240 it was going to be easier to use the
00:14:42.560 second thing is they said I'm not
00:14:44.519 getting enough support I thought this
00:14:46.399 was going to be handheld the whole time
00:14:48.399 when in fact this is more of a DIY
00:14:50.320 product the third is okay even if I am
00:14:53.519 techy enough and I have enough support
00:14:55.600 I'm not getting the result that I wanted
00:14:57.320 soon enough it actually takes me much
00:14:59.199 longer than I expected now when we look
00:15:01.600 at these three things by the way these
00:15:03.680 are going to be very common complaints
00:15:05.440 with any service main reason if you
00:15:07.560 think about the value equation I was
00:15:08.720 stating earlier if someone says it takes
00:15:10.959 it's too techy that means there's a lot
00:15:12.639 of effort and sacrifice required right
00:15:14.759 which is one of the four things so they
00:15:16.199 said too much effort and sacrifice when
00:15:18.480 they say not enough support it means
00:15:20.600 they thought it was going to be easier
00:15:23.079 meaning their perceived likelihood of
00:15:25.320 achievement was higher and then when we
00:15:27.519 got into reality they're like oh my
00:15:29.120 perceived likelihood is much lower
00:15:30.680 because this looks hard and so two of
00:15:33.480 our four value drivers have already been
00:15:35.399 eliminated it's like oh no and then
00:15:37.440 finally we've got this thing's taking
00:15:39.240 longer so we have our time delay and so
00:15:41.519 when we look at these three things they
00:15:43.120 actually are the inverse they're the
00:15:44.480 nightmare version of the unv value
00:15:46.639 equation it takes too long I now don't
00:15:49.639 think I'm going to be able to be
00:15:50.519 successful and this thing is going to
00:15:52.440 take way too much effort and sacrifice
00:15:54.120 so if these are the problems how do we
00:15:55.759 solve them so we actually solve two of
00:15:57.759 these problems with the same solution
00:15:59.560 and one of them we solved with a
00:16:00.880 completely different solution so one and
00:16:02.639 three we did by rescripting the sales
00:16:04.399 process overall and so fundamentally you
00:16:07.240 could solve this problem in two ways one
00:16:08.680 is we could add more to the thing on the
00:16:10.800 back which costs money and that's okay
00:16:13.319 or we can simply set better expectations
00:16:15.399 up front and so when we listen to sales
00:16:17.880 calls we're like oh I could understand
00:16:19.240 why someone would think this if he says
00:16:21.560 it this way or I could understand why
00:16:23.480 they would think it would be happen this
00:16:25.120 fast the way they set those expectations
00:16:27.639 and so we rescripted the sales process
00:16:29.880 and here's the thing guess what we sold
00:16:32.519 the same amount and so a lot of times
00:16:34.279 when you're a small business owner you
00:16:35.319 feel like you have to promise the moon
00:16:36.560 but the thing is is that sometimes when
00:16:37.720 you promise the Moon it actually makes
00:16:39.279 people doubt you more CU they're like I
00:16:40.720 don't even believe you and so sometimes
00:16:42.639 when you actually lower expectations you
00:16:44.279 increase their perceived like of
00:16:45.839 achievement because they actually
00:16:46.920 believe you now they're like okay that
00:16:48.680 seems realistic and so it actually
00:16:50.680 didn't change our close rates at all and
00:16:52.639 so sometimes you can reel your sales
00:16:54.319 team back and still close the same
00:16:56.079 amount by just being clear and honest
00:16:58.920 and to be fair I don't think the guys
00:17:00.000 were trying to be dishonest it was just
00:17:01.600 we found out that the way they said some
00:17:02.880 of these things gave an expectation that
00:17:04.520 was different and by just doing that we
00:17:06.359 solved two out of these three problems
00:17:08.280 so the third one was people saying not
00:17:09.839 enough support so of course we could add
00:17:12.119 more support which I'll get to something
00:17:13.799 we did in a second but what we did was
00:17:15.839 we wanted to increase their perception
00:17:17.599 of support and the way we did that was
00:17:19.559 we made it more available so we already
00:17:21.640 had support we had a support team but
00:17:23.799 the thing is is that they were difficult
00:17:25.280 to reach so we did was we created chat
00:17:27.160 support but we made it easily accessible
00:17:29.400 within the software and so rather than
00:17:31.039 have to go outside in order to reach
00:17:32.720 them they could hit a bubble and then
00:17:34.440 immediately be online chatting someone
00:17:36.320 now remember from the onboarding call
00:17:37.919 they also know specifically who they can
00:17:39.480 reach out to as well so this is two
00:17:41.360 types of support they have an account
00:17:42.600 rep design assigned to them and they
00:17:44.679 have kind of General support to help
00:17:46.080 them through daily little things that
00:17:47.960 were coming up and in your business you
00:17:50.039 probably have similar things you have
00:17:51.480 one person who's really responsible for
00:17:53.000 the account and then maybe a team of
00:17:54.960 people who kind of feel the general
00:17:56.440 questions from dayto day and by doing
00:17:58.640 this this we eliminated this perceived
00:18:00.919 problem people had even though we
00:18:02.400 already had the solution we just had to
00:18:03.840 make it easier for them and so if you
00:18:05.240 want the 2011 Advanced business owner
00:18:07.559 hat what we actually were a to find out
00:18:09.200 is based on the chat bubble what page in
00:18:12.640 the software they were clicking for
00:18:14.880 support were're able to see which Pages
00:18:17.799 or at what parts in the process of using
00:18:20.520 the software people were getting stuck
00:18:22.480 they were getting bottlenecked and so
00:18:24.080 this gave us huge insights in terms of
00:18:26.039 our product road map to figure out okay
00:18:28.799 these are the places we need to be
00:18:29.880 putting more of our attention so even if
00:18:31.840 the engineering team's like man I want
00:18:33.080 to build this amazing new thing it's
00:18:34.440 like well dude 82% of our complaints are
00:18:37.280 coming from this one point so we need to
00:18:39.120 clear up this page and make it easier
00:18:40.720 for them to understand so we don't have
00:18:42.480 to keep doing this and so on the product
00:18:44.640 side we're able to proactively solve it
00:18:46.280 by making the page easier and reactively
00:18:49.000 make it easier for them to get support
00:18:50.400 even if it doesn't solve it so let me
00:18:51.600 give you one more cool little tidbit
00:18:53.440 that we did which I recommend across
00:18:55.159 everything not just on product which is
00:18:57.880 we lowered the average grade level of
00:18:59.880 the language we used on the page and so
00:19:02.600 once we lowered the grade level of the
00:19:04.120 language more people understood it and
00:19:06.159 were able to use it and I'm telling you
00:19:07.919 right now if you're sending emails or
00:19:09.600 you're writing ads or you're scripting a
00:19:12.039 sales process or an onboarding process
00:19:14.760 run the script through a reading level
00:19:17.240 grader and it will tell you what grade
00:19:19.960 the vocabulary you're using is based at
00:19:22.960 and so if you're talking to people at a
00:19:25.360 sixth grade level or an eighth grade
00:19:27.280 level then guess what 30% of people are
00:19:30.200 automatically not even going to
00:19:31.360 understand what you're saying and as
00:19:32.440 crazy as this is a huge slice of America
00:19:35.080 doesn't even know how to read this isn't
00:19:36.760 about being highbrow and hotty you're
00:19:39.080 trying to help as many customers as you
00:19:40.520 can their money is as good as anyone
00:19:42.159 else's and so if you want to immediately
00:19:44.200 get improved conversion improved
00:19:46.840 experience better expectations lower
00:19:49.159 refunds just lower the grade level of
00:19:51.799 the language you speak at so to be clear
00:19:53.600 these are the problems these were the
00:19:55.320 solutions let's go on to problem number
00:19:57.159 three so the third big problem was
00:19:58.880 actually how we were compensating our
00:20:00.600 team so the problem is we had misaligned
00:20:02.559 incentives so we had tons of people were
00:20:04.200 incentivized to sell on the front end
00:20:05.880 but we had no one who was incentivized
00:20:07.640 to keep people on the back end so the
00:20:09.280 first problem here and this is a really
00:20:11.000 big one that I see happen too often is
00:20:13.440 the sales team was Fielding customer
00:20:15.400 support issues and so let me be super
00:20:18.559 clear if you want to destroy your sales
00:20:21.159 team and annihilate any kind of Goodwill
00:20:24.760 and Morale on that team have them talk
00:20:27.520 to all the disat ified customers that
00:20:29.679 they sold last week while they're trying
00:20:31.880 to sell new customers on how great the
00:20:33.960 product is today horrible decision but
00:20:36.880 that's exactly basically what would
00:20:38.039 happening because they didn't have a
00:20:39.280 dedicated rep and so the person they had
00:20:41.080 actually spoken the longest with was a
00:20:42.440 sales rep and so they reached out to the
00:20:43.960 person they knew that helped them do
00:20:45.520 this so they could get help these people
00:20:47.200 aren't equipped to do it also
00:20:48.559 unfortunately neither are they
00:20:49.840 incentivized to and so it destroys their
00:20:51.760 front-end sales destroys their
00:20:53.200 conviction and they also takes up time
00:20:54.919 on their calendars and they're trying to
00:20:56.440 be ethically good people but at the same
00:20:58.080 time it's just outside of scope the
00:20:59.640 reason this is so important for the
00:21:00.799 sales team is that the underlying tone
00:21:03.159 of how someone talks to a prospect is
00:21:04.960 going to be their conviction right so
00:21:06.320 that's a big term but it just means like
00:21:08.440 how they say the words the pace that
00:21:11.080 they say the words where they emphasize
00:21:13.320 where they lean back and so if you want
00:21:16.240 to destroy conviction you show them that
00:21:18.559 the thing they're selling sucks because
00:21:20.320 then they won't want to push they won't
00:21:21.799 want to ask for their questions cuz on
00:21:23.200 some level they're like you know what I
00:21:24.320 don't even know if this person's going
00:21:25.360 to get helped with this now every person
00:21:28.080 here has that somebody you know in your
00:21:29.760 life who had their life changed right so
00:21:31.840 if you've ever had somebody who you know
00:21:33.320 became a Christian and then was on fire
00:21:35.840 for the Lord you can feel the conviction
00:21:38.440 that they have now some of them don't
00:21:39.679 have the skill of sales but you can feel
00:21:41.480 that they believe what they're selling
00:21:43.320 what they're talking about and so if
00:21:45.880 conviction is one of the strongest
00:21:47.440 predictors of sales close rate because
00:21:49.799 of how you say the words on the script
00:21:52.640 then destroying that is surely the way
00:21:54.480 to destroy sales so the second issue
00:21:56.440 here is that because we had misaligned
00:21:57.799 incentives our CS team didn't try so if
00:22:00.559 someone reached out they would maybe
00:22:03.200 respond maybe respond slowly and they
00:22:05.039 had no incentive to really get a hold of
00:22:07.600 them and the easiest way I can explain
00:22:09.240 this is imagine you have a kid or a
00:22:12.360 parent or a family member or a friend
00:22:14.039 who's in trouble and you need to reach
00:22:16.159 them would you just shoot them a text
00:22:18.720 and then be like I guess I'll just
00:22:20.279 figure it out no you would text them
00:22:22.640 multiple times you'd call them multiple
00:22:24.240 times you'd reach out to them on social
00:22:26.440 media you'd call their friends to see if
00:22:28.240 you can get get in touch with them you
00:22:29.559 would actually try to get a hold of them
00:22:32.520 not just go through the motions and so
00:22:34.440 RCS team at the time wasn't trying the
00:22:37.919 third was that if they did somehow get
00:22:40.600 in contact with the customer because
00:22:41.919 that customer was right there at that
00:22:44.000 moment when the Cs person responded and
00:22:46.200 they'd hop on a call with them the call
00:22:47.880 was unstructured they had no script they
00:22:49.480 were following they had no process they
00:22:51.080 basically just said what can I help you
00:22:53.039 with and then they would go from there
00:22:54.520 which is a terrible way to handle Cs and
00:22:56.799 I want to give you a a larger take away
00:22:58.799 from this so I'm I'm leaking into number
00:23:00.720 three here every conversation with a
00:23:02.600 customer has a perfect way that that
00:23:04.720 conversation could and should go and so
00:23:07.120 if you know that there are consistent
00:23:08.559 conversations that are going to happen
00:23:09.799 with your business you know that there's
00:23:11.039 a sales conversation you know there's a
00:23:12.480 lead nurture conversation you know
00:23:13.880 there's an onboarding conversation guess
00:23:15.679 what else there is there's multiple CS
00:23:17.760 or customer success conversations that
00:23:19.640 are going to occur well if we script all
00:23:22.320 this stuff and then we don't script all
00:23:23.880 this stuff why do we think that this
00:23:25.279 stuff would somehow be better than this
00:23:26.520 stuff in your mind you're like wait but
00:23:28.120 the problems they have are different on
00:23:29.679 the back end no they're not the same
00:23:32.360 people who say they're going to have
00:23:33.799 different problems on the back end are
00:23:35.520 the same people who are like every sale
00:23:37.039 is the same well you can't have it both
00:23:39.440 ways sure well they're only going to ask
00:23:41.600 questions about timing they're going to
00:23:43.080 ask questions about decision maker
00:23:44.679 they're going to try and stall they're
00:23:46.080 going to try and say they don't have the
00:23:47.159 money for it oh wait these are all
00:23:48.840 different things that someone's going to
00:23:49.880 present with here well over here they're
00:23:53.360 going to say oh I don't know how to log
00:23:54.840 in oh I don't know how to do step one oh
00:23:56.840 I don't know how to do step two oh this
00:23:58.600 third thing broke how do I fix it
00:24:00.559 they're going to have the same few
00:24:02.600 things that 90% of people are going to
00:24:04.640 present with and guess what we do we
00:24:07.000 script so this is what we did to solve
00:24:09.000 these three problems so number one is
00:24:12.080 instead of having no team and having the
00:24:14.520 sales team field it we created a
00:24:16.440 dedicated escalations Team all right so
00:24:18.799 think about this as triage so if you get
00:24:21.279 hurt the first thing you do when you go
00:24:23.039 to the emergencies is they have triage
00:24:24.240 they basically figure out how badly hurt
00:24:26.279 you are and where you need to go that's
00:24:28.000 what the escalations team did that was
00:24:30.080 the first thing so just off doing that
00:24:32.600 close rate goes up sales team morale
00:24:34.559 stays High because now they also have
00:24:36.159 someone they can just shuttle people
00:24:37.360 over to if it comes to them these people
00:24:39.440 become the catchall the second thing is
00:24:41.760 okay well now that we have the
00:24:42.679 escalations team now we can align their
00:24:45.279 incentives we can create a commission
00:24:46.880 structure so that we have real cost in
00:24:49.120 the business for someone leaving one is
00:24:51.279 we have to give a refund or we have to
00:24:52.760 give a charge Mark which sucks right or
00:24:55.039 the bigger one that no one talks about
00:24:56.600 is you just have a lower reputation
00:24:58.880 people buy and then tell other people
00:25:00.640 not to buy so you lose maybe no money on
00:25:04.039 this sale but you lose three customers
00:25:06.919 you would have lost over here so it's
00:25:08.279 worse than a refund you lost three times
00:25:10.840 or five times the amount and guess what
00:25:12.520 happens from these people these people
00:25:14.080 tell other people not to buy the thing
00:25:16.000 so sometimes not serving One customer
00:25:17.919 can cost you tons and tons of money so
00:25:19.720 let me give you a little litmus test for
00:25:21.159 this if your ads or your method of
00:25:24.799 getting customers was getting you
00:25:26.360 customers at call it 10 to1 in the
00:25:28.080 beginning beginning and all of a sudden
00:25:29.919 now you're getting customers at 5 to1 or
00:25:32.120 3:1 and it's only been a year later your
00:25:34.360 cost to a Car customer should only go up
00:25:37.039 with the increased cost of CPM meaning
00:25:39.080 the cost per impression and so if cpms
00:25:41.399 go up by 15% a year or whatever they go
00:25:43.480 up by then that's the amount that your
00:25:45.240 ca should go up your cost to acquire a
00:25:47.200 customer now the good news is that as a
00:25:49.360 business owner you can increase your LTV
00:25:51.640 over time as well and so you can combat
00:25:54.000 that increase in CA with a corresponding
00:25:55.919 increase in lifetime value but if your
00:25:59.039 CAC has gone up double or triple in a
00:26:01.600 short period of time everyone wants to
00:26:03.600 believe that they're so good to get
00:26:04.720 referrals but no one believes that
00:26:06.440 they're bad enough to get
00:26:15.840 anti-realists of customers that would
00:26:17.799 have bought now won't because they know
00:26:20.120 someone who told them you suck and the
00:26:22.039 big obvious one is that if someone's not
00:26:23.440 satisfied they're also not going to buy
00:26:25.399 your next thing so what we did was we
00:26:28.559 added a 10 to 15% commission yes real
00:26:32.320 money on the back end for saving
00:26:34.799 customers because if I have to pay $200
00:26:38.360 to save a $2,000 sale then I would
00:26:41.480 certainly rather have $1,800 than
00:26:44.559 zero and so some of you guys get greedy
00:26:46.799 on this but it's like just do the math
00:26:49.240 and so we did the commission structures
00:26:51.399 we added the escalations team and so
00:26:53.360 what about the unstructured calls you
00:26:55.240 guessed it we scripted it and then you
00:26:59.120 know what we did after we scripted it we
00:27:01.159 practiced the script and so we said hey
00:27:03.440 what happens if someone presents with
00:27:04.880 problem number one same as what if
00:27:07.120 someone says they have to talk to their
00:27:08.279 spouse what if someone says they don't
00:27:09.760 have their card on them what if someone
00:27:11.120 says not now's not a good time what if
00:27:13.279 someone says you get the idea you script
00:27:15.559 it and you practice it but now we have a
00:27:17.880 dedicated team that has an incentive
00:27:20.080 that's aligned and a scripted process
00:27:22.320 that we know yields a consistent result
00:27:24.480 and gets people unfucked in the
00:27:26.640 situation now remember I said that CS
00:27:29.360 didn't try well guess what the result of
00:27:31.760 this commission incentive was all of a
00:27:33.600 sudden because they had an incentive
00:27:35.480 they were texting they were emailing
00:27:37.600 they were calling three to five times so
00:27:40.600 now all of a sudden it's almost like
00:27:42.240 they give a [Â __Â ] because they get paid
00:27:44.760 to Wild I know I'll be here all day so
00:27:48.200 let me let me give you the the real
00:27:49.799 breakdown of this to get in contact with
00:27:51.440 a customer when they are escalated or
00:27:53.320 they have some sort of issue that's
00:27:54.559 presenting is the inverse of lead
00:27:56.600 nurture now if you're thinking through
00:27:58.320 this with your 201 Advanced business
00:27:59.880 owner cap a business actually looks a
00:28:02.039 lot like a bow tie all right so you've
00:28:03.799 got lots of marketing that funnels into
00:28:05.120 a sales process and you have a lead
00:28:06.799 nurture process that leads into that and
00:28:08.640 then you have onboarding and then you go
00:28:10.640 back out again so let me explain what
00:28:12.240 that looks like if you work a lead a lot
00:28:14.960 in the beginning and then less and less
00:28:16.840 over time because they're less
00:28:18.559 interested so in the beginning you call
00:28:19.919 them three times a day and then three
00:28:21.200 times a day tomorrow and then a week
00:28:22.279 later you maybe call once a day and then
00:28:24.399 after that you call them once every two
00:28:26.000 weeks just to follow up it's actually
00:28:28.399 the reverse with a customer so you call
00:28:31.600 them and reach out to them via email SMS
00:28:34.919 and call one time today if they don't
00:28:37.360 respond tomorrow I'm reaching out twice
00:28:40.200 the next day I'm reaching out three
00:28:41.559 times we actually increase the amount of
00:28:44.120 Reach Out attempts we have for the
00:28:45.360 customer because the issue is clearly
00:28:47.559 more and more escalated whereas with a
00:28:49.519 lead you decrease the amount that you
00:28:51.679 reach out to them as time goes on to fix
00:28:53.880 the sales feeding issue we created the
00:28:55.440 team to align their incentives we
00:28:57.640 created the Mission and then that
00:28:59.039 created multi-lane ReachOut that was
00:29:01.559 repetitive and escalating over time and
00:29:04.159 when they did finally get in contact
00:29:05.559 with them we had a scripted process that
00:29:07.120 we had trained on so that they could
00:29:09.440 execute the right conversation every
00:29:11.559 time so the result of bad onboarding
00:29:14.440 getting fixed bad expectations getting
00:29:16.640 set and misaligned incentives was the
00:29:20.559 big result and then I'll give you the
00:29:21.840 takeways that you can immediately use in
00:29:23.360 your business so the result of all that
00:29:25.120 work was three main things this is the
00:29:27.000 net change one we had a 61% reduction in
00:29:31.360 cancellation so people wanting to leave
00:29:32.880 or refund or have some negative
00:29:34.200 experience the second is that 25% so one
00:29:37.519 in four of the people who got on a
00:29:39.120 support call an escalation call chose to
00:29:42.120 ascend and actually buy a higher level
00:29:44.159 of service meaning you know what I
00:29:46.159 thought I was going to need just a
00:29:47.240 little bit of handholding I actually
00:29:48.919 want to have more and I'm willing to pay
00:29:50.399 for more help with that thing I just
00:29:51.840 bought and then three is that
00:29:54.480 companywide because these
00:29:56.480 implementations happened across all
00:29:58.519 facets of the company 2.4x the overall
00:30:02.399 ascensions and so obviously here with
00:30:04.720 the escalations we got a piece here we
00:30:06.480 got a piece on the front we got a piece
00:30:07.640 on the side but the overall when you
00:30:09.720 aggregate all these changes together was
00:30:11.039 a 2.4x increase that was that 20 to 48%
00:30:14.760 increase in ascensions almost half of
00:30:16.720 customers who bought the first thing
00:30:18.200 decided they actually wanted to buy an
00:30:19.960 even better more expensive version of
00:30:21.840 thing with more Professional Services
00:30:23.240 tacked on top now here's where this is
00:30:25.440 extremely
00:30:26.559 sexy I only talk to you about the $2
00:30:29.080 million in the reductions what I didn't
00:30:33.159 include was all the extra money because
00:30:35.120 most people don't even believe the
00:30:36.080 numbers anyways but the extra money that
00:30:38.840 we were able to make and so the cool
00:30:40.720 thing is is that all of this drops
00:30:43.360 straight to the bottom line because
00:30:44.760 we've already paid the cost to acquire
00:30:46.279 the customer and software has
00:30:48.000 notoriously high gross margins meaning
00:30:50.399 someone buying another version or higher
00:30:53.320 priced version of the software cost
00:30:55.159 pennies versus how much we're charging
00:30:57.519 for it all right so here are the first
00:30:58.799 five takeaways for you one there's
00:31:01.480 always going to be a cost of change or
00:31:03.760 something new and so whenever you're
00:31:05.679 going to introduce something don't get
00:31:07.720 discouraged from the initial stats
00:31:10.399 that's just opportunity to improve all
00:31:12.679 right so whenever I see something like
00:31:14.360 that like when we had these big numbers
00:31:15.600 in the beginning I was like oh man we're
00:31:17.279 going to be able to crush this and make
00:31:18.519 even more as soon as we Crump these
00:31:20.399 things down because the thing is is the
00:31:22.200 problems are known and the solutions are
00:31:24.480 also known we just have to do them all
00:31:26.600 right so number one the cost of change
00:31:28.480 is fixed number two if you don't track
00:31:31.200 you don't care and so when I talk to
00:31:33.840 businesses and I sometimes ask them like
00:31:35.360 hey what are your customer success
00:31:36.399 scores or what are your what are your
00:31:37.480 CAD scores or what are which is customer
00:31:39.480 satisfaction or what are your NPS scores
00:31:41.120 which is net promoter score they're like
00:31:43.120 uh it's really good I think our refund
00:31:44.519 rate's low okay there's a big difference
00:31:46.760 between people hating you so much that
00:31:48.320 they ask for their money back and the
00:31:50.600 massive amount of people who just don't
00:31:52.200 like you but don't hate you enough to
00:31:53.679 ask for back because it's inconvenient
00:31:55.720 the amount of money doesn't cost enough
00:31:56.799 to them or they just said screw it I'm
00:31:58.600 just going to move on with my life and
00:31:59.720 tell everyone I know that you suck and
00:32:01.159 in the very beginning when I started
00:32:02.799 asking prodding more around these
00:32:04.480 questions we didn't have metrics around
00:32:06.159 almost any of this stuff and so
00:32:08.080 sometimes one of the easiest things to
00:32:09.480 do is ignore a problem by not tracking
00:32:11.279 any of it but one of the most
00:32:13.240 interesting things that I found across
00:32:14.840 business and humans in general is that
00:32:17.480 metrics can be an intervention into and
00:32:20.399 of itself if I want someone to lose
00:32:22.480 weight I don't even have to tell them
00:32:24.279 anything to do besides weighing themsel
00:32:26.679 every morning and when you do that you
00:32:28.679 start to lose weight and so metrics and
00:32:31.919 tracking itself can be a powerful
00:32:34.600 intervention overall in any business for
00:32:36.880 something that you want to improve and
00:32:38.279 so if you're not even sure what to do to
00:32:40.240 fix a problem the first step you can do
00:32:42.279 is just track it number three is that
00:32:44.440 you're never too big for good Cs and so
00:32:47.679 think about companies like Chick-fil-A
00:32:49.120 they've got gazillions of employees and
00:32:50.760 they still have an amazing customer
00:32:52.120 experience think about companies like
00:32:53.480 Amazon that sell gazillions of dollars a
00:32:55.440 year of products now you think wait a
00:32:57.440 second I've never been on the phone with
00:32:58.880 customer sport on Amazon well I can tell
00:33:00.480 you I have and it's good and it's fast
00:33:03.600 and for a company that size for them to
00:33:04.880 be able to field the number of increas
00:33:06.519 I'm sure that they get per day is insane
00:33:08.720 but they still don't think they're too
00:33:10.399 good or too big to have an amazing
00:33:12.480 customer experience number four a lot of
00:33:14.639 entrepreneurs are very afraid of talking
00:33:16.600 to unhappy customers but I promise you
00:33:18.919 that is where the gold is and I continue
00:33:20.799 to say this but Paul Graham from YC has
00:33:22.840 said this before he says you can solve
00:33:25.200 almost every business Problem by talking
00:33:27.240 to your customer more and so if you want
00:33:29.120 to know what's going on with sales talk
00:33:32.519 to the people who just got sold if you
00:33:34.039 want to know what's going on with the
00:33:35.120 product figure out where people are
00:33:36.399 asking all the questions on your page
00:33:38.720 just get on the phone sometimes ask
00:33:40.320 people why didn't you buy on the phone
00:33:42.120 and they will give you the gold you need
00:33:44.519 to fix your sales process to fix your
00:33:46.159 product to fix your onboarding so that
00:33:47.880 they actually will in the future so get
00:33:51.000 on the phone with people who hate you
00:33:53.000 and by the way a lot of times if you
00:33:55.000 just let them vent you just let them
00:33:56.559 talk to you A lot of them will actually
00:33:57.880 give you more money too and if one out
00:34:00.000 of four customers buy something that's
00:34:02.120 four or five times as expensive you
00:34:04.200 actually recovered 100% of the refunds
00:34:07.679 or cancellations that you get think
00:34:09.639 about this for a second if you have a
00:34:11.239 $1,000 thing and you sell a $4,000 thing
00:34:14.119 is your upsell if you get on the phone
00:34:16.320 with four people and one of these people
00:34:18.320 buys the $4,000 thing that escalation to
00:34:20.599 Ascension covered the loss from the
00:34:22.918 other three so you can eliminate the
00:34:25.520 revenue loss you have by simply seeing
00:34:28.079 the conversation for what it is which is
00:34:30.760 it's also a sale and as a side note
00:34:32.679 unhappy customers will usually get on
00:34:34.079 the phone with you so especially if they
00:34:36.040 feel underserved the pickup rate on the
00:34:38.119 cost for these is actually through the
00:34:39.520 roof when we started reaching out the
00:34:41.119 team was like oh wow like they pick up
00:34:42.679 pretty fast because they gave you money
00:34:44.119 and they want their value number five
00:34:46.320 followup is a double-edged sword so let
00:34:48.280 me explain here if you sell low ticket
00:34:52.879 lots of units of stuff those customers
00:34:55.760 in general cannot be communicated with
00:34:58.079 too much people love when they're in the
00:35:00.720 low end to be talked to all the time the
00:35:03.160 more affluent your customer the
00:35:05.320 wealthier the more expensive the thing
00:35:07.520 often time counterintuitively they don't
00:35:10.079 want you to reach out to them they just
00:35:11.720 want it to work and so understanding
00:35:15.160 what level of Avatar you're selling to
00:35:17.359 can help you understand how often you
00:35:20.680 should reach out to those customers for
00:35:23.000 example for me with a vendor I never
00:35:24.800 want to talk to them I just want it to
00:35:26.200 work now some people if they're spending
00:35:28.680 that amount of money with you and it's a
00:35:30.200 lot of money to them then they're going
00:35:32.160 to want to talk to you all the time and
00:35:33.920 if that's the nature of the customer you
00:35:35.079 sell to then you have to deal with that
00:35:36.640 so let's talk magically about these
00:35:38.520 other three six seven and eight so the
00:35:41.599 first is revenue retention now when I
00:35:44.960 was starting out in business all I care
00:35:46.960 about was sales and marketing was just
00:35:48.359 getting more people in the front door
00:35:50.200 what I thought it took to grow a
00:35:51.800 business was to just sell more of those
00:35:53.400 people and that's only half true now let
00:35:56.240 me tell you a story of two different
00:35:57.319 businesses
00:35:58.200 let's say there's a business that sells
00:35:59.880 100 customers this year 200 customers
00:36:02.200 next year 300 customers the third year
00:36:04.640 and that business loses 100% of
00:36:06.319 customers every year so that business
00:36:08.040 has still tripled three years later
00:36:10.560 business 2 sells 100 customers this year
00:36:14.160 100 customers next year but they kept
00:36:15.920 the first 100 so they have 200 customers
00:36:17.800 and then 100 customers the third year
00:36:19.880 but they kept the 100 and the 100 so now
00:36:21.800 they have 300 customers both of these
00:36:23.640 companies are the same size at the end
00:36:25.240 of year three but which company would
00:36:27.319 you have this one because the thing is
00:36:30.359 is that here you're keeping all your
00:36:32.400 customers and unless you have a
00:36:34.599 compounding vehicle within your business
00:36:36.760 the only way to grow is to continue to
00:36:38.440 Market and sell more but I promise you
00:36:40.560 there's a cap to that there's a reason
00:36:42.440 that people in the information direct
00:36:44.599 response whatever space can't grow past
00:36:47.000 a certain amount because they have
00:36:48.599 basically the marketing team of a $300
00:36:51.680 million business but they're only doing
00:36:53.319 30 because they can only do 30 that year
00:36:56.119 and lose everybody every single year and
00:36:58.760 so I want to be clear it's valuable to
00:37:00.640 understand how to acquire customers you
00:37:02.040 have to learn how to do it especially
00:37:03.680 when you're starting out but it's one of
00:37:05.960 those double-edged swords where what it
00:37:07.280 took you to get here and get started
00:37:08.680 isn't what it takes to create a really
00:37:10.440 big business and so in this business we
00:37:13.200 get obsessed and me personally as an
00:37:14.960 investor the number one thing I look at
00:37:16.880 is how many customers last year are
00:37:18.160 still paying you because I can build on
00:37:20.520 that base if we're not keeping anyone
00:37:22.640 then what's the point in adding gas to
00:37:24.040 this fire we're just letting more people
00:37:25.720 know we suck the next takeaway is around
00:37:27.880 pilots and so you'll notice that we only
00:37:29.720 did this with 15% of customers and so
00:37:32.079 this was going to be a more expensive
00:37:34.440 intervention right we went from one on
00:37:35.920 25 to one on one so there's a huge
00:37:38.119 amount of headcount that we're going to
00:37:39.200 add for this but when we test we test
00:37:42.440 with a very small slice to make sure
00:37:44.000 that it's worth the investment and let's
00:37:46.280 say that these numbers had only
00:37:47.920 marginally improved then I'd be like all
00:37:49.839 right now I wouldn't have said okay we
00:37:51.520 shouldn't fix them I would say this
00:37:52.960 isn't the way we fix them we thought we
00:37:55.000 had a hypothesis that it would work but
00:37:57.000 we actually did it properly but it
00:37:58.240 didn't turn out the way we thought and
00:37:59.920 so when you test you just test basically
00:38:01.800 a guess that I think this will solve it
00:38:03.920 and so if you think about this like the
00:38:05.200 scientific method which you remember
00:38:06.520 from sixth grade you have a hypothesis
00:38:08.720 then you figure out did we do the thing
00:38:10.800 yes or no and did the thing we want to
00:38:13.000 have happened happen and so if you never
00:38:15.599 execute it you'll never know if your
00:38:16.839 hypothesis is true or not and so you
00:38:18.480 have to have a good guess you have to
00:38:19.839 actually do it and then you can still
00:38:22.000 perfectly execute something and have it
00:38:23.560 still not work but understanding the bet
00:38:25.760 you're going to make and what is
00:38:27.560 required which you can Define ahead of
00:38:29.040 time what do these stats need to look
00:38:30.720 like for this to be a worth it deal and
00:38:33.079 if it is then you roll it out and around
00:38:35.480 Revenue retention that cost that we just
00:38:38.560 talked about by incurring these extra CS
00:38:41.040 reps if I can employ somebody for 70,000
00:38:44.920 a year or 100,000 a year and then they
00:38:47.000 can save me $2 million a year or
00:38:49.800 $500,000 a year I'm still getting 5 to
00:38:53.200 one back on the internal resource
00:38:55.560 allocation and so the bigger business
00:38:57.880 gets the more you actually become more
00:38:59.319 like an investor you have to think I
00:39:00.920 have all these people I have all these
00:39:02.560 resources I have all this money and I
00:39:04.200 want to allocate these resources in a
00:39:05.880 way that gets me the highest return
00:39:07.079 within the business and so if you have
00:39:08.560 something can get you a 5x or a 10x
00:39:10.520 within the company you make that bet
00:39:12.200 every time proactive CS so we want to be
00:39:15.560 as fast or faster reaching out to
00:39:18.240 customers as we are with leads and I
00:39:20.480 want to tell you a little story that's
00:39:21.920 not about this company but about a
00:39:23.240 different company we have that might
00:39:25.280 drive this home so we look at our LTV
00:39:28.319 across a huge slice of customers and it
00:39:30.920 turned out the second highest LTV Avatar
00:39:33.680 we had was customers that we saw were
00:39:36.640 not using the full extent of The Suite
00:39:38.720 of services we had and we proactively
00:39:41.079 downgraded them we said hey it looks
00:39:43.119 like you're only using three of the 10
00:39:45.040 things we do if you're only going to use
00:39:46.800 these three we actually have a service
00:39:48.280 level that's half of what you're
00:39:49.640 currently paying and you get the same
00:39:51.160 stuff and here's the crazy thing when
00:39:53.520 you do a proactive downgrade where it's
00:39:56.480 actually still completely meeting their
00:39:58.960 expectations those people never cancel
00:40:01.480 they're like this this place is awesome
00:40:03.319 they were ethical about it they reached
00:40:04.480 out to me they helped me save money like
00:40:05.760 I love these guys and as business owners
00:40:08.200 we're afraid to do that but if that
00:40:10.160 person cancels in two months versus
00:40:11.800 staying for 10 it's worth way more not
00:40:14.520 to mention the compounding Word of Mouth
00:40:16.280 the referrals and all the other benefits
00:40:18.000 testimonials that we can get down the
00:40:19.440 road from that customer from being run
00:40:21.160 like a good business and so if you treat
00:40:23.800 the customers as important as you do
00:40:25.800 your leads you'll probably be in really
00:40:27.760 good shape and hey this is all customer
00:40:29.800 success stuff this is all getting people
00:40:31.520 to like you more and spend more money
00:40:32.920 with you but if you need to do more
00:40:34.359 marketing let me show you a case study
00:40:36.280 did for one of our portfolio companies
00:40:37.480 where we doubled it in 60 days
