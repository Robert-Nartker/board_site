# Businesses Making Under $10,000,0000 Cannot Afford to Make This Mistake
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/sjt5G3YPjmY

00:00:00.080 businesses making less than $10 million
00:00:02.600 per year cannot afford to make this
00:00:04.839 mistake and it's a problem that limited
00:00:06.319 me and my ability to sell my company but
00:00:08.200 when I fixed it I was able to sell it
00:00:09.519 for $ 46.2 million and there are four
00:00:12.240 steps to solving this problem to avoid
00:00:14.960 This calamity and lots of blood and
00:00:17.199 death and it all starts with number one
00:00:19.800 keyman risk a single person that is
00:00:22.640 vital to the operations of the business
00:00:24.920 and if they were gone the business would
00:00:27.480 decrease materially in the amount of
00:00:29.720 money that it makes or disappear
00:00:31.560 altogether and so think about it like
00:00:33.520 this you've got these functions that
00:00:35.440 occur in the business on a regular basis
00:00:37.520 and there may be multiple people that
00:00:39.200 can do these functions and so the
00:00:41.520 opposite of keyman risk is redundancy
00:00:43.760 meaning if one of these people disappear
00:00:46.079 we still have a flow for let's say
00:00:48.760 dollars to go across this bridge it can
00:00:50.800 still keep kind of make its way through
00:00:53.079 but all of a sudden if you've got one
00:00:54.800 here and it doesn't matter how many
00:00:56.800 different redundancies you have in the
00:00:58.320 rest of the system if this goes away
00:01:01.199 there's no way else for the dollars or
00:01:03.840 the customers to move across and
00:01:05.400 hopefully into your pocket that's my
00:01:07.320 little pocket for you why this matters
00:01:09.600 is that if you have keyman risk you
00:01:11.560 don't have an asset you have a
00:01:13.439 high-paying job and I don't say that to
00:01:15.720 insult you I say that so that you can be
00:01:17.759 aware of it so that you can actually fix
00:01:19.920 it and to be clear if you are fine just
00:01:24.119 working and not necessarily owning an
00:01:25.960 asset that's great there's nothing wrong
00:01:27.680 with trading time for money big fan and
00:01:29.759 so so I'll give you an example when I
00:01:31.159 had gym launch I was kind of the
00:01:32.520 innovator of the product and the service
00:01:35.600 and so I came up with the solutions for
00:01:38.799 the gyms and so for an acquirer or a
00:01:41.439 private Equity Firm who wants to buy
00:01:43.079 this business or whoever else you might
00:01:45.240 want to sell a business too having one
00:01:47.439 person especially if it's the person
00:01:48.880 who's going to leave when the business
00:01:51.119 is sold is a huge massive red flag for
00:01:54.920 them because they're like wait we're
00:01:56.280 buying this production but it's with
00:01:58.079 this key cog in the machine and you want
00:02:00.159 to have us buy this thing and remove the
00:02:02.759 Cog now in a situation where you raise
00:02:05.399 money for example it's not as much of an
00:02:07.159 issue because those people those pieces
00:02:09.318 those cogs are still in the machine if
00:02:11.440 you wanted to sell a company and you own
00:02:14.440 the company and you leave and all the
00:02:16.239 people who are still keyman remain
00:02:18.120 within the business then what they're
00:02:19.560 going to do is try and incentivize those
00:02:21.120 people to stay but it still makes the
00:02:22.640 company sellable so this just counts
00:02:24.599 double if it's the owner or somebody
00:02:27.319 who's going to leave as a result of a
00:02:29.319 transaction
00:02:30.360 is the keyman risking any of the
00:02:32.000 functions of the business so I was
00:02:33.879 keyman in the delivery and so I did a
00:02:36.959 couple things to solve the problem so
00:02:39.360 number one is that I created a
00:02:42.840 department called the R&D department and
00:02:45.200 so the way it worked was simple I
00:02:46.840 thought about the process that I would
00:02:48.400 go through when I wanted to innovate the
00:02:50.400 product so I'd say okay what can we do
00:02:51.959 for our gym owners that will help them
00:02:53.920 generate more leads make more sales
00:02:56.400 whatever the issue was and so the first
00:02:58.599 thing that I did was that I would say
00:03:00.640 okay I have a way of identifying
00:03:02.400 problems and so I would ask the
00:03:04.560 customers and the nice thing is if you
00:03:06.120 listen to your customers they will shout
00:03:07.480 at you and they will tell you exactly
00:03:08.799 what their problems are and so I'd say
00:03:10.480 Okay number one is that I had these
00:03:11.879 problems now I have to solve those
00:03:13.200 problems and so I'd have them rank the
00:03:14.720 problems they say okay this month lead
00:03:17.120 generation is the biggest issue they
00:03:18.640 want more leads and I'd say all right
00:03:20.920 now the next thing that I would do is I
00:03:22.360 would deploy resources so this would be
00:03:25.239 time and money that ideally my customers
00:03:28.680 couldn't deploy but I could
00:03:30.599 fractionalize that cost between all of
00:03:32.720 my customers to create a much bigger
00:03:34.519 individual investment that any one of
00:03:36.080 them could afford and so let's say they
00:03:38.599 pay $3 or $4,000 a month I would spend
00:03:42.360 $50,000 a
00:03:44.480 month on this test and so I'd say okay
00:03:48.200 go hire a bunch of models go out to a
00:03:50.640 really good gym film some great ads then
00:03:54.280 test Those ads so number three I would
00:03:56.799 test the ads in representative Market
00:03:59.799 markets so I'd have 20 markets or so
00:04:01.680 that would represent different
00:04:02.879 demographics so black white asian
00:04:05.360 Hispanic poor markets Rich markets large
00:04:07.799 markets small markets with good
00:04:09.360 operators with poor operators with
00:04:10.640 mediocre operators that way I had a true
00:04:12.439 sampling rather than just saying I'm
00:04:14.000 just going to send this to my favorite
00:04:15.040 customers because that's not going to
00:04:16.040 work and so we test it and then what I
00:04:18.560 would do is hand off winners and so what
00:04:22.800 that meant was I would say okay these
00:04:25.759 ads of the 30 that we ran and we spent
00:04:28.240 $50,000 on this whole thing these two or
00:04:30.759 three were the ones that generated the
00:04:32.039 highest returns and then I would give
00:04:34.039 all of those to the gyms in our
00:04:35.600 distribution base so that they could run
00:04:37.240 those ads they just wanted the inputs to
00:04:40.000 feed the system and those inputs were
00:04:42.080 required on a regular basis in order for
00:04:43.880 me to hand this off to someone I said
00:04:45.240 this is fundamentally the way I do it I
00:04:46.960 look at the problems that they have in
00:04:48.120 this instance it was lead generation I
00:04:49.759 would dedicate time time and money to
00:04:51.440 solving this problem in a way that they
00:04:52.919 couldn't do it so that I could create a
00:04:54.280 better solution that they could do it on
00:04:55.639 their own I would test to validate that
00:04:58.039 the solution that I had was Superior and
00:05:00.080 then we roll it out and I followed this
00:05:02.320 process for my R&D so that I could
00:05:04.960 replicate the person with a system and
00:05:09.000 so typically keyman risk will occur in
00:05:12.520 three primary areas so number one is
00:05:15.919 that it can occur in marketing so how do
00:05:18.720 we get leads in the door the second big
00:05:22.160 place that it can occur is sales or
00:05:24.600 conversion how do we get prospects to
00:05:27.280 hand US money for our goods and services
00:05:29.800 and then third is the actual goods and
00:05:32.400 services themselves which you can
00:05:33.759 consider product Etc this happens at any
00:05:36.120 level so if you're a service and you're
00:05:37.440 just happen to be the best plumber or
00:05:38.840 the best electrician or you're the best
00:05:40.600 coder or you're the best Advertiser now
00:05:42.880 with marketing for example if you own a
00:05:44.240 marketing agency you probably your key
00:05:45.919 man on marketing for yourself and
00:05:47.919 marketing for your customers right like
00:05:49.720 it can happen in multiple places even if
00:05:51.280 it's one person and in the and the more
00:05:53.840 places one person is keyman the riskier
00:05:56.639 the business is overall now I want to be
00:05:58.440 clear keyman risk is a double-edged
00:06:00.319 sword because the more valuable you
00:06:02.759 become more of a key man you are and so
00:06:05.840 the idea is that as soon as you learn a
00:06:08.160 very valuable skill the most valuable
00:06:10.520 thing that you can do next is learn how
00:06:12.039 to transfer that skill to another person
00:06:14.039 and I think this is a skill that I've
00:06:15.599 spend a tremendous amount of time trying
00:06:17.360 to hone so that I can build companies
00:06:20.360 and I think about it like this assemble
00:06:22.599 companies assemble people and then
00:06:24.720 transfer the skills around whatever area
00:06:27.440 has some sort of bottleneck where
00:06:28.720 there's too few people people who know
00:06:30.039 how to do the thing and this is so
00:06:31.599 important because whether you want to
00:06:33.840 sell a business or not making a business
00:06:36.599 that is sell a bull makes it better for
00:06:39.160 anyone here's the best analogy I have
00:06:40.639 say that you've bought a house now if
00:06:42.160 you've never bought a house before then
00:06:43.479 this may be news but when you buy a
00:06:45.199 house what happens is that after a
00:06:46.560 certain amount of time and the average
00:06:47.680 American like three to five years they
00:06:49.360 they they change where they live all
00:06:50.800 right so you buy a house now over time
00:06:52.759 you got some wear and tear on the house
00:06:54.560 and the house kind of degrades in your
00:06:56.199 mind right like that you get a little
00:06:57.560 crack on the front porch this this door
00:06:59.319 kind of squeaks a little bit and when
00:07:01.280 you go to sell what do you do well you
00:07:04.080 fix the you fix the little path in front
00:07:06.720 of the house you put some oil on the
00:07:08.520 little hinges here you know you're like
00:07:10.000 you know what maybe I'll put a little
00:07:11.000 patio out back I feel like that would
00:07:12.199 increase our home value right and then
00:07:14.319 all of a sudden and this is the crazy
00:07:15.800 thing right when you're about to sell
00:07:17.720 the house and you fixed all the things
00:07:19.400 that are wrong with it you're like you
00:07:20.520 know this house ain't so bad right and
00:07:23.960 so the same exact thing happens with the
00:07:26.160 business if all of a sudden you remove
00:07:28.199 yourself as keyman in marketing and
00:07:30.199 sales and product all of a sudden you're
00:07:32.360 like
00:07:34.039 huh this business almost runs without me
00:07:37.199 this ain't so bad now the last area that
00:07:39.560 you can have keyman risk that can occur
00:07:41.520 and this is kind of like the glue
00:07:42.800 between all of
00:07:44.280 these
00:07:45.879 is operations so if you have a key
00:07:49.800 leader for example who has tremendous
00:07:52.400 influence over the entire team then the
00:07:55.960 operations connects the people to their
00:07:58.120 functions and so think of that as kind
00:08:00.039 of the glue that runs the organization
00:08:01.960 like if ilila were to leave she would
00:08:04.199 leave a huge vacuum at acquisition.
00:08:06.280 comom now she's not specifically over
00:08:08.639 Marketing sales or product she just has
00:08:10.919 all of these leaders that are rolling
00:08:12.360 into her and so if the leadership was
00:08:14.560 gone that in and of itself would also be
00:08:17.639 somebody who's key man and to be clear
00:08:20.240 key man is Key Human so it doesn't have
00:08:23.000 to be a Founder it can be an employee
00:08:25.080 who can be keyman and if you do have
00:08:27.280 someone who's keyman in your business
00:08:28.919 and it's your business and not theirs
00:08:31.280 then it would behoove you if they're
00:08:32.719 truly key man to incentivize them in
00:08:35.519 some material way to stay so if you're
00:08:37.519 thinking to yourself okay this is me I'm
00:08:39.919 definitely keyman or there's somebody in
00:08:41.559 my business who's keyman on Marketing
00:08:43.200 sales operations product then there are
00:08:46.160 two major ways that you can solve this
00:08:49.160 so the first is through process and
00:08:51.760 people just like I walked through
00:08:53.279 earlier where I said okay what are the
00:08:55.279 actual steps that I do in order to solve
00:08:57.519 this marketing problem what are the
00:08:58.519 actual steps that I use use to think
00:09:00.440 through creating new products what are
00:09:02.120 the actual steps that I use to think
00:09:04.120 through creating sales process driving
00:09:05.800 sales results Etc so it's process and
00:09:08.600 the people who will then do those
00:09:10.480 processes within the business the second
00:09:12.680 way and this really only applies if it's
00:09:15.839 not you who is the person who's keyman
00:09:19.079 is
00:09:20.040 incentives and so if it's
00:09:22.640 you you only have option one if it's
00:09:26.000 somebody else other people you have
00:09:28.079 option one and option to to solve the
00:09:31.079 problem and so for example if I said hey
00:09:34.000 I will incentivize you to stay in this
00:09:35.880 business by giving you some vesting of
00:09:38.200 shares over a three or 5e period then
00:09:41.839 that would make it less likely that the
00:09:43.680 person's going to leave and disrupt the
00:09:45.399 business I think through it in both of
00:09:47.079 these now which of these is the most
00:09:48.839 valuable like most valuable to the
00:09:50.640 business to do well the most valuable to
00:09:53.079 do is this one but the higher up the
00:09:56.200 skill set is the more unique the
00:09:57.839 individual like think about Elon Musk
00:09:59.560 he's key man in almost all of his
00:10:01.120 businesses but the reason that it's okay
00:10:03.640 is that he has no desire to sell them
00:10:06.200 and so people bet on Elon and the
00:10:08.720 companies they bet on Jeff basos and the
00:10:11.800 the businesses because they are
00:10:13.560 inseparable entities like they go one
00:10:15.880 together and no one's leaving right they
00:10:18.720 got public and all of their Shares are
00:10:20.360 still theirs and they're still
00:10:22.120 incentivized to continue to grow it now
00:10:24.560 if you're watching this and wondering
00:10:25.800 well okay processing people what does
00:10:27.640 that actually mean so ins inside $100
00:10:29.640 million leads I break this down so in
00:10:31.800 the employees section which is a chapter
00:10:33.399 in the book in terms of how to help how
00:10:35.000 to get people to get you more customers
00:10:37.040 you have the functions that an employee
00:10:39.200 would do and so there's two aspects one
00:10:40.920 is like how do I get these people and so
00:10:43.519 you can use warm Outreach to ask your
00:10:45.320 network you can do cold Outreach which
00:10:47.200 is basically recruiting you can post
00:10:49.040 content which is basically posting job
00:10:50.639 openings that you have available doing
00:10:52.519 paid ads so promoting job postings on
00:10:54.880 like a Craigslist or an indeed or a
00:10:56.639 monster or a ladder getting employee
00:10:58.720 referrals right so rather than customer
00:11:00.279 referrals you're getting employee
00:11:01.200 referrals Affiliates would be like
00:11:03.160 associations guilds list serves that
00:11:05.200 already have a huge amount of people who
00:11:07.320 want this specific type of roller job
00:11:09.320 agency so think like staffing firms and
00:11:11.519 then obviously employees themselves uh
00:11:13.560 could be could be the solution now how
00:11:15.600 do you get them to actually do this and
00:11:17.440 so the step one is that you document
00:11:19.079 which is basically saying hey here's our
00:11:21.279 checklist of things that must occur in
00:11:23.639 order for this process to be deemed
00:11:25.240 complete or sufficient the second D here
00:11:29.000 is demonstrate which is that you do it
00:11:30.839 in front of them right so you do it on
00:11:32.360 your own and you create the checklist
00:11:33.800 then you do that checklist in front of
00:11:35.880 them and you only stick with that
00:11:37.360 checklist because if you do anything off
00:11:38.720 the checklist then you have to add to it
00:11:41.160 and then finally you they do it in front
00:11:43.639 of you so they duplicate it so you
00:11:46.440 document checklist you demonstrate it in
00:11:48.399 front of them then they demonstrate it
00:11:49.839 in front of you which is basically
00:11:51.200 duplication and so that three-step
00:11:53.560 process is fundamentally how you can
00:11:55.560 teach anyone to do anything and in order
00:11:58.600 to make a process more teachable you
00:12:01.839 simply have to break it down to more and
00:12:03.760 more steps based on the skill of the
00:12:05.800 person you're teaching it to if I wanted
00:12:07.800 to teach an advanced marketer how to do
00:12:10.760 email marketing for example I wouldn't
00:12:13.240 say hey turn on your computer step two
00:12:16.800 pull up Internet Explorer step three
00:12:18.560 sign up for a Gmail account right I
00:12:19.839 wouldn't have to go through all those
00:12:20.800 steps because there's an assumed level
00:12:22.360 of proficiency this is why when you go
00:12:24.160 to college or whatever education system
00:12:26.240 you went through there are prerequisites
00:12:28.000 for moving on to the next level so that
00:12:29.440 they don't have to teach you arithmetic
00:12:31.399 and then teach you calculus later they
00:12:33.120 just assume you know it and so your
00:12:34.959 checklist that you create is going to
00:12:37.199 depend on the level of the person that
00:12:39.320 you're teaching the skill to and the
00:12:41.120 lower the level the more checks you're
00:12:43.000 going to be on the list the more you
00:12:44.720 need to regress it and so let's say you
00:12:46.480 brought on somebody for sales right
00:12:48.399 who's going to be a director of sales
00:12:49.720 this might be a higher level world you
00:12:51.120 would still follow the same thing as hey
00:12:52.720 these are the activities that I spend my
00:12:54.399 time on this is what I actually do then
00:12:57.680 they're going to watch you do it you
00:12:59.480 probably are running teams you're
00:13:00.800 probably doing one-on ones you're
00:13:02.360 probably looking at data to look for key
00:13:04.760 out points so that you can address them
00:13:07.079 and solve them within the team and then
00:13:09.720 they are going to take over those
00:13:11.560 responsibilities do them in front of you
00:13:13.480 and then when they have done them to the
00:13:14.800 satisfactory level you can then delegate
00:13:17.160 it and so the easy litmus test for good
00:13:19.519 delegation is that after you've given
00:13:22.079 the responsibility away and someone else
00:13:24.399 is actually doing the actions then the
00:13:27.639 performance of the department or
00:13:29.160 function either remains neutral or goes
00:13:30.959 up that is when you have successfully
00:13:32.480 delegated it's not that you give
00:13:34.440 something to someone that makes it
00:13:36.160 delegation you can give something to
00:13:37.839 someone and completely abdicate or
00:13:39.600 basically get rid of responsibility but
00:13:41.959 with no feedback loop to determine
00:13:44.040 whether or not you did a good job or
00:13:45.360 that they're doing a good job and so it
00:13:47.639 has to be the performance of the
00:13:49.000 function after you've handed off that
00:13:50.959 determines whether or not you have
00:13:52.399 successfully delegated and sometimes you
00:13:54.519 have to repeat the cycle multiple times
00:13:56.079 with the same person and that's okay
00:13:57.800 because you need to learn to on how to
00:13:59.560 teach better and quick Pro tip if you're
00:14:01.560 a smaller business and let's say that
00:14:03.680 you do some sort of service and it's
00:14:05.800 just you or just you and a couple people
00:14:07.839 there are three options that you can do
00:14:10.120 when you have too much demand and very
00:14:12.560 fixed amount of Supply like you can't
00:14:14.240 you can't you're you're completely maxed
00:14:15.759 out you can't take on any more customers
00:14:17.560 you barely can't so option one is that
00:14:20.480 you can simply raise your prices and if
00:14:22.920 you do that you'll absolutely make more
00:14:25.160 money so you'll get paid more for the
00:14:26.759 same thing which is my favorite way of
00:14:28.199 getting paid now the second thing that
00:14:30.120 you can do is you can increase the
00:14:31.519 service ratio and so that means instead
00:14:33.759 of doing oneon-one for example I would
00:14:35.800 do one on five or one on 10 now
00:14:39.079 alternatively you can think of it with a
00:14:41.480 team the same way which is let's say I
00:14:43.240 have four people who work in my agency
00:14:44.920 and they do different functions to serve
00:14:46.399 one type of customer then if I can
00:14:48.279 change it from those four people
00:14:50.399 together can handle 20 clients I could
00:14:52.160 have those four people together handling
00:14:53.600 40 clients and so the ratio still shifts
00:14:56.680 towards us so you get more efficient
00:14:58.519 which is either process or some sort of
00:15:00.199 technology or training that allows you
00:15:01.759 to get more from your existing Talent
00:15:04.680 the third and this is the most valuable
00:15:06.519 one is that you do
00:15:09.519 this processing people is that you
00:15:11.680 actually get somebody else to do the
00:15:13.399 work for you which typically means you
00:15:14.839 have to organize the stuff make sure
00:15:16.600 they they did it successfully and you
00:15:18.440 can hand it off now these two things
00:15:20.399 both make you more money this one helps
00:15:23.160 you eliminate the actual problem of
00:15:24.839 keyman risk and if I had to do this in
00:15:26.880 sequence meaning in what order would I
00:15:28.639 do this first is I would raise prices
00:15:31.040 because that requires the least amount
00:15:32.680 of work and can immediately make me
00:15:34.040 money if I'm Supply constrained second I
00:15:36.959 would say okay well people are saying
00:15:38.639 yes to these higher prices well I don't
00:15:40.120 want to raise prices again which you
00:15:41.720 obviously still can I can shift my
00:15:44.040 service ratio at this current price to
00:15:47.000 fundamentally Dude down the service that
00:15:48.959 I have because it's so good and as long
00:15:51.160 as my value still exceeds my price
00:15:52.839 without raising the price with this
00:15:54.279 second implementation I would still have
00:15:56.160 people who want to give me money now if
00:15:58.319 I've done as much of these two things as
00:15:59.959 I can I can then say you know what I
00:16:02.600 want to not have to do any of these
00:16:04.079 things at all I want someone else to do
00:16:05.759 them and then that transforms this
00:16:07.920 particular job that you have because as
00:16:09.759 an entrepreneur you'll have more than
00:16:11.000 one job it takes this job takes the hat
00:16:13.279 off your head and puts it on someone
00:16:14.639 else's and then that shifts you towards
00:16:16.920 owning an asset rather than owning a job
00:16:19.079 and to be clear I'm all for maximizing
00:16:21.040 the amount of money that you're making
00:16:22.759 and some businesses lend themselves more
00:16:25.639 to kind of the people and process stuff
00:16:27.440 than others do Taylor Swift for example
00:16:29.839 is going to have a hard time being like
00:16:31.440 hey this is my blonde double and she's
00:16:34.079 going to sing for you guys today because
00:16:35.959 look I've I've delegated the
00:16:38.120 responsibility now it's very unlikely
00:16:40.240 that that would happen and so there are
00:16:42.600 situations where you just have unicorns
00:16:44.639 in a business and so that's where you
00:16:46.560 just have to align incentives like crazy
00:16:48.920 and try and take it all the way which is
00:16:51.319 either you're just getting a paid a ton
00:16:52.560 of money which you know Taylor Swift
00:16:54.000 does or you create liquidity meaning you
00:16:58.120 you get paid for the equity shares that
00:17:00.319 you have via a different vehicle than
00:17:02.720 selling so when you go public you don't
00:17:04.760 you sell a little bit of the company but
00:17:06.640 the vast majority of the wealth that
00:17:08.000 most of those Founders have is that they
00:17:09.640 have shares that they can take loans
00:17:11.000 against the bigger a business gets if
00:17:12.799 you don't have any desire to sell you
00:17:14.359 can take debt or other instruments where
00:17:16.079 people will lend you and you can
00:17:17.280 collateralize or back it up with the
00:17:19.760 stock that you have in the business and
00:17:21.280 so if you don't pay them back they get
00:17:22.599 to own shares in the company if you are
00:17:24.240 keyman in your business or someone else
00:17:25.880 in your business is keyman help me
00:17:27.400 spread the word with this because these
00:17:28.880 mes cost me so dearly that I hope that
00:17:30.799 it prevents everyone else from making
00:17:32.120 them that way we can all ride into the
00:17:33.679 sunset into our amazing businesses that
00:17:35.640 are risk-free and making all the money
00:17:37.559 in the entire world so if you could hit
00:17:39.320 the share button and send it to friends
00:17:41.280 and family and even enemies for you know
00:17:43.360 I mean like hey they need help too or
00:17:44.880 friend ofies maybe a little bit safer
00:17:46.600 than it would me in the world otherwise
00:17:47.840 enjoy the rest of it so now that we
00:17:49.080 covered keyman risk the next mistake
00:17:51.360 that business owners under 10 million
00:17:53.080 doll make is single Channel risk now
00:17:56.120 that's just a fancy word so let me tell
00:17:57.520 you what it means if more than half of
00:17:59.159 your customers or leads come from one
00:18:01.200 place you have single Channel risk and
00:18:03.039 the concept behind this is that if that
00:18:05.720 were to stop it would materially affect
00:18:08.000 your business on a long time Horizon so
00:18:10.360 quick illustration one of our portfolio
00:18:12.200 companies which is the teeth whing chain
00:18:13.720 got a lot of business from outbound
00:18:16.320 almost all customers were coming from
00:18:18.520 that specific Source all of a sudden the
00:18:21.200 rules on that platform changed based on
00:18:23.559 the way that we could message almost
00:18:25.559 overnight we had 50 to 70% few sales
00:18:29.360 coming in from that primary channel that
00:18:31.880 is single Channel risk can you imagine
00:18:34.200 as a business owner over overnight
00:18:35.679 you're like oh my God this real change
00:18:37.080 if you're ads dependent let's say the
00:18:38.559 way that you get customers is on meta
00:18:40.440 ads and then you you lose your account
00:18:42.320 boom all of a sudden your business
00:18:43.720 almost goes to zero or if you have an
00:18:45.640 organic content following and you're
00:18:47.480 only on one platform for example and
00:18:50.280 that platform bans you or restricts you
00:18:52.360 or Shadow bands whatever and then boom
00:18:54.200 all of your lead flow disappears or you
00:18:56.520 have let's say a domain or a server that
00:18:58.559 you send your emails from when you do
00:19:00.200 outbound and all of a sudden that gets
00:19:02.480 whacked with some sort of you go into
00:19:04.240 the promotions tab on email all of a
00:19:06.360 sudden all your response rates from your
00:19:08.000 domain go to almost nothing in each of
00:19:10.679 those scenarios you have single Channel
00:19:13.159 risk now thankfully for this particular
00:19:15.320 business I had spent the last 6 months
00:19:17.880 or more building out a recurring Revenue
00:19:20.200 stream and I I detailed that in a
00:19:21.840 different video where we went from like
00:19:23.080 5% of Revenue being uh recurring Revenue
00:19:25.440 to over 60% of Revenue being recurring
00:19:27.640 Revenue even though we decreased the
00:19:30.000 amount of new sales coming in by over
00:19:32.200 half it didn't actually change our
00:19:34.200 overall Revenue because we had so much
00:19:36.320 compounding that had started to become
00:19:37.720 unlocked which is why there are multiple
00:19:39.840 ways to stabilize a business but for the
00:19:41.840 purpose of this video if you have only
00:19:44.360 one way to get customers then you have
00:19:46.400 one way to lose them so if you have
00:19:49.360 Facebook ads that are running in this
00:19:52.200 boat and this is how you get your little
00:19:53.960 fishies there's our little fishy from
00:19:56.039 Facebook and then this thing breaks all
00:19:58.200 of a sudden
00:19:59.159 you've got no fish and then you would be
00:20:01.360 very sad and then you would jump
00:20:02.960 overboard and die very sad for you and
00:20:05.280 your family and you know peace and
00:20:07.080 blessings be upon you now let's say that
00:20:09.400 you're this other guy and you said you
00:20:10.679 know what I have seen this happen before
00:20:13.159 because I've had account shut down from
00:20:15.280 organic from paid or domains that that
00:20:17.720 don't work out anymore for for cold
00:20:19.679 outbound but you know what I've made
00:20:22.159 YouTube organic I've got ads I've got
00:20:25.520 email outbound let's say we also have
00:20:27.559 Instagram content or organic okay so
00:20:30.080 let's say that our our same our same
00:20:32.400 issue happens with Facebook boom this
00:20:34.640 guy loses the fish here now this fish is
00:20:37.159 very happy because he's not going to die
00:20:38.679 and get eaten all right but but we still
00:20:41.679 have all these other fish that are
00:20:43.520 coming in from the other channels and so
00:20:46.280 this guy is still like you know what I
00:20:48.200 still do have a little bit of a tummy
00:20:49.760 here from all the fish that I've been
00:20:50.880 eating maybe it's good for me to tighten
00:20:53.520 tighten the belts a little bit and then
00:20:55.039 I can go home and feed my family and
00:20:56.840 they've been a little chunky as well
00:20:58.640 well lately and so you know what and
00:21:00.360 farm fishing is bad and let's talk about
00:21:02.640 all sorts of political things anyways
00:21:05.159 back to it you can see the problem here
00:21:07.280 clear as day if you have one source of
00:21:09.320 getting customers you've also only got
00:21:11.000 one that needs to break in order to fail
00:21:13.080 and to show how these lessons stack
00:21:14.720 together if we only had one keyman and
00:21:17.200 then this guy dies very sad right he's
00:21:19.320 little double X's here all right Dead
00:21:22.120 all right because he had no fish if we
00:21:24.000 had a second fisherman who was on the
00:21:26.120 deck he might say you know what I'm
00:21:27.799 going to throw another line out and
00:21:29.279 maybe I'm going to catch some of these
00:21:30.440 YouTube fishies over here and at least
00:21:32.919 you'd have a shot but if you have single
00:21:35.240 Channel risk and keyman risk you're
00:21:37.440 double if you wanted to buy this
00:21:39.120 fisherman business would you well it's
00:21:41.080 like well shoot there's so many ways for
00:21:42.880 this thing to fail versus this one this
00:21:45.440 guy's got a crew of people that are all
00:21:47.960 Manning each of the the polls and so
00:21:51.039 even if
00:21:52.600 they that looks bad but if any of these
00:21:56.520 guys went down so this guy jumps
00:21:58.039 overboard right then these guys are
00:22:00.200 still like Yay I'm going to get a pay
00:22:01.520 raise hey can we get his payroll those
00:22:03.120 greedy bastards but this is
00:22:05.400 fundamentally a fishing boat that I
00:22:07.400 would have a much larger likelihood of
00:22:11.120 buying because it has a larger
00:22:13.000 likelihood of producing fish
00:22:14.760 consistently so first off who needs to
00:22:17.080 worry about this well it's more
00:22:18.960 important the bigger your business gets
00:22:20.520 the more important this is and let me
00:22:22.159 explain tactically how this works
00:22:24.120 because let's say even volatility from a
00:22:26.360 single channel is something that could
00:22:28.039 Rock the the boat figuratively if you
00:22:30.159 have a small business and let's say the
00:22:32.120 channel goes down by 20% then let's say
00:22:34.520 you've got one sales guy and his
00:22:35.840 calendar goes from 100% filled to 80%
00:22:38.000 filled not a huge deal if you have a 100
00:22:41.080 sales guys and their calendars go from
00:22:44.600 100% right to all of a sudden 20 of the
00:22:47.600 guys have completely empty calendars
00:22:49.559 that level of volatility that can occur
00:22:51.960 when you only have one channel makes it
00:22:54.600 much more difficult to do business on a
00:22:56.440 regular basis there's a variety of
00:22:58.559 solutions that I will walk you through
00:23:00.440 so number one is that if you're a tiny
00:23:02.400 business you don't need to worry about
00:23:03.919 this yet but my biggest advocate for
00:23:07.240 being a small business is that you're
00:23:09.480 going to have one primary method for
00:23:11.120 getting cold people which is usually
00:23:13.039 going to be outbound number one which is
00:23:15.520 you're reaching out to prospects who
00:23:16.640 don't know who you are two is going to
00:23:18.880 be Affiliates so again you've got third
00:23:21.960 parties that are sending you traffic
00:23:24.159 three you've got ads that are ways that
00:23:27.159 people are coming into the business
00:23:28.520 business and you've got organic so this
00:23:30.320 is going to be likely how you're going
00:23:31.880 to be getting customers now I would
00:23:34.360 recommend that you do one of these three
00:23:36.600 and then plus this now this may seem
00:23:39.240 like a little bit of a departure from
00:23:41.000 some of the things I've talked before
00:23:42.240 where one channel one Avatar one product
00:23:44.720 up to a million dollar a year and that's
00:23:46.159 true it's just that I've seen like so
00:23:48.600 many people be able to manage this it's
00:23:50.880 such high return for such low effort
00:23:53.480 that the organic that you put here is
00:23:55.640 not really to acquire customers it
00:23:57.840 actually functions more to amplify what
00:24:00.400 you're doing with these other channels
00:24:02.640 and so if you are doing outbound and
00:24:05.039 then people Google you and then they can
00:24:06.480 find a little bit of content then it's
00:24:07.919 like oh this is guy this guy has a poll
00:24:09.600 so this is a real business someone is an
00:24:11.559 affiliate or Affiliates are sending you
00:24:13.039 customers or you're trying to sell
00:24:14.080 Affiliates then just knowing that you
00:24:16.039 have some sort of presence increases the
00:24:17.360 likely they do business with you and
00:24:18.600 same thing with ads and so if you're a
00:24:20.279 small business this is going to be one
00:24:21.320 of the big ones that you're probably
00:24:22.320 going to use but the organic is just
00:24:24.400 something that you can do even one post
00:24:26.320 a week it doesn't have to be a ton just
00:24:27.919 to look like you have a pulse now if
00:24:30.600 you're a bigger business then this
00:24:32.320 becomes a much bigger deal for you the
00:24:34.120 way that we solve this is uh a
00:24:36.000 standardized process that I've now had
00:24:37.640 to jump through with a lot of companies
00:24:39.520 so the first thing we do is we Shore up
00:24:42.320 long-term nurture so long-term nurture
00:24:44.559 means a combination of making more
00:24:47.120 content and email specifically followup
00:24:51.320 because a lot of people a lot of
00:24:53.039 businesses don't do a good job following
00:24:55.120 up with leads and so they have this list
00:24:56.760 of 10,000 or 20,000 1,000 people that
00:24:59.600 have done business with them over a long
00:25:00.679 period of time or at least given them
00:25:01.960 their information if we create a Cadence
00:25:03.760 or some sort of schedule around reaching
00:25:06.039 out to those people providing value and
00:25:07.799 then occasionally presenting offers
00:25:09.440 we're going to have another stream of
00:25:11.919 customers that's coming in so think of
00:25:13.880 this as in a way another customer stream
00:25:17.240 but it's an incredibly lowrisk customer
00:25:19.279 stream that is the most profitable of
00:25:21.399 all streams and so email marketing for
00:25:23.600 example has depending on the source a
00:25:25.640 42:1 to 36:1 return on dollars it's like
00:25:29.679 oh my God like why would we not do that
00:25:31.640 so we do this to decrease our risk
00:25:33.600 increase our cash flow in the short term
00:25:35.720 to get that engine going the next engine
00:25:37.960 that I like to make sure is very strong
00:25:39.880 is my referral engine and so if I
00:25:41.640 haven't put a strong referral system in
00:25:43.760 place to get customers to send me more
00:25:46.000 customers and made sure that I'm asking
00:25:48.399 multiple times in different and creative
00:25:50.880 ways throughout the customer Journey
00:25:52.480 then I Implement that next again we're
00:25:54.200 getting more for what we put in and if
00:25:55.679 we get more that's going to increase our
00:25:57.159 cash flow without adding cost basis to
00:25:59.120 the business so it's basically think
00:26:00.039 about it it's like decreasing risk and
00:26:01.679 increasing our ability to make bets
00:26:03.480 after we've got the long-term nurture
00:26:04.760 firing and we've got the referral system
00:26:06.640 going this should give us a little bit
00:26:08.360 of padding to then invest in the second
00:26:11.200 Channel now when I say invest the way
00:26:14.120 that it typically works is that you will
00:26:16.799 see no outcome for an extended period
00:26:19.480 and then all of a sudden it will start
00:26:21.080 working and you may get frustrated in
00:26:23.039 the short term that you're not seeing
00:26:24.440 immediate results but welcome to
00:26:25.919 business you have to think long term
00:26:27.600 about the value of what a second
00:26:29.120 acquisition Channel or third acquisition
00:26:30.960 Channel means to you so number one is
00:26:32.559 that when you do the second acquisition
00:26:34.279 Channel you can immediately double sales
00:26:36.360 or more and if you double Revenue you
00:26:38.720 typically far more than double profit so
00:26:41.559 that's number one number two is that the
00:26:44.520 business itself becomes less risky so
00:26:46.520 not only are we adding revenue and
00:26:48.200 profit to the business the revenue and
00:26:49.760 profits itself is more likely to
00:26:51.640 continue and so the business itself
00:26:53.159 becomes more valuable and you can sleep
00:26:54.720 much better at night knowing that if one
00:26:56.399 of these things goes down my team is
00:26:58.520 still fed and so when we make this
00:27:00.640 investment here's one of the big no no
00:27:02.880 is you don't do two news so what does
00:27:04.960 that mean well if you're going to start
00:27:06.240 a new channel that's one new what you
00:27:08.279 don't want to do is put a new person on
00:27:10.320 a new channel because then you don't
00:27:12.200 know which new is the problem because
00:27:14.559 even if you take you and maybe you're
00:27:16.240 really good or your best person and you
00:27:18.039 put them on the new channel well there's
00:27:20.039 already the newness of the new channel
00:27:21.640 and you won't know but if it's somebody
00:27:23.159 you know who's really good then at least
00:27:25.279 we're working through the channel itself
00:27:27.360 otherwise you could be stuck paying lots
00:27:29.440 of money for a long period of time not
00:27:31.440 knowing if you're solving the right
00:27:33.039 problem which is why I'm such an
00:27:34.320 advocate for Founders to have deep
00:27:35.919 understanding of the core processes of
00:27:37.640 the business which for me are understand
00:27:40.200 how you get customers which to me
00:27:41.480 marketing and sales and understand how
00:27:42.919 you deliver value now if you wanted to
00:27:44.799 Outsource it if you wanted to Outsource
00:27:46.279 accounting if you wanted to Outsource
00:27:47.519 you know HR or payroll processing those
00:27:49.200 are things that I don't see as core to
00:27:50.360 the business you can of course bring
00:27:51.360 them in house when it cost makes sense
00:27:52.840 but in terms of the core economic engine
00:27:56.039 of the business those are the things
00:27:57.360 that you the founder the entrepreneur
00:27:58.679 want to understand intimately if I am
00:28:00.559 going to start a new channel I do these
00:28:02.519 two things first in order to give myself
00:28:04.240 some breathing room I get a little more
00:28:05.640 cash flow I get a little bit more from
00:28:07.080 what I'm already doing and then I have
00:28:09.360 one new which is the new channel and
00:28:12.440 then old person now it doesn't actually
00:28:14.799 have to be old but it's somebody that I
00:28:15.960 know all right and so this can be tough
00:28:19.279 because you're like wait wait I don't
00:28:20.519 want my original channel to go down
00:28:22.399 which is the most common thing that
00:28:24.519 happens in the situation and so my
00:28:26.840 recommendation is transfer the skill on
00:28:29.880 the first Channel first to someone else
00:28:33.559 make sure that they can handle that
00:28:35.320 without decreasing performance ideally
00:28:37.399 it goes up then and only then you can
00:28:40.880 then make the investment into the second
00:28:42.799 Channel where you're the old guy and the
00:28:45.360 channel is the new thing now if you want
00:28:47.039 to bring somebody in to help you with
00:28:49.320 this I think that's a great idea like if
00:28:50.840 you're a larger business and you're like
00:28:52.279 I can't actually just like figure out
00:28:53.720 cold outbound that's fine but you
00:28:55.279 basically have a thought partner and you
00:28:56.640 guys are working through it together
00:28:58.440 because you'll have more context on the
00:28:59.919 business overall and maybe they have
00:29:01.240 more context on the methodology that
00:29:03.279 you're going to use for the second
00:29:04.440 Channel but that merger those things
00:29:06.159 coming together where you learn a lot
00:29:07.840 about the method they learn a lot about
00:29:09.240 the context of the business both people
00:29:11.120 get better this is how I've been able to
00:29:13.080 successfully use all of these different
00:29:15.200 methods of getting customers in
00:29:16.440 different companies now that we've
00:29:17.799 covered single Channel risk the next
00:29:19.840 mistake that business owners make under
00:29:21.600 10 million is key customer risk and
00:29:24.760 we're almost there I mean you can see
00:29:25.960 this tiny little Gap here I guess we
00:29:27.320 could fall down here to our deaths but
00:29:29.640 we're going to assume that we've got
00:29:30.679 some pretty good UPS here and we can we
00:29:32.200 can make this little jump so here's a
00:29:34.159 visual to kind of make this make sense
00:29:35.799 for you if any customer or Associated
00:29:38.600 customers left tomorrow would your
00:29:40.519 Revenue drop by 20% or more now the
00:29:42.720 reason 20% is kind of the number I
00:29:44.200 choose is that most businesses run at 10
00:29:46.279 20 30 40% margins and so if you had even
00:29:48.919 a 40% margin which would be a great
00:29:50.480 margin you lose half your profit this
00:29:52.320 would be material to the business itself
00:29:55.080 and its value so I'll give you a real
00:29:56.640 business story so I had a business owner
00:29:58.799 come out to acquisition. comom who was
00:30:00.679 an agency owner and he had 10 customers
00:30:04.720 and nine of his customers were small
00:30:08.200 like Tech SEO like agency customers and
00:30:11.960 then one customer was Google itself and
00:30:15.080 he was a massive percentage of his
00:30:16.840 Revenue so for him for this example this
00:30:19.559 was actually 70% of his Revenue so if
00:30:22.600 you actually look at the meat of this
00:30:23.919 fish and you added all these little
00:30:25.320 pieces of meat in between together this
00:30:27.240 is definitely the fish that has all the
00:30:28.760 money if I'm this owner I'm like oh my
00:30:30.720 God if I if I lose this whale it's going
00:30:32.880 to kill my business I'm going to I I
00:30:34.799 won't be able to I have to let go of
00:30:36.080 half my staff certainly lose all my
00:30:37.840 profit and so this is a huge risk to the
00:30:40.440 business so there are four proven ways
00:30:43.200 to solve this problem so when this
00:30:45.080 business owner came out I said we're
00:30:46.640 going to go through all four and you're
00:30:48.039 going to pick the one that you think you
00:30:49.200 have the highest likelihood of achieving
00:30:50.720 and so if this is you this is how you
00:30:52.600 solve it so the first way you can do it
00:30:54.440 is that you simply go get more I got to
00:30:57.559 draw these fish cuz I have no idea I
00:30:59.320 have to think about how to draw these uh
00:31:01.120 these little fishies here all of a
00:31:02.639 sudden you get a bunch more minnows and
00:31:05.080 then all of a sudden by percentage man
00:31:07.600 these are ugly fish by percentage you
00:31:09.519 know what this will isn't 70% of my
00:31:11.760 business anymore so you just keep adding
00:31:13.840 minnows to your boat and then all of a
00:31:15.519 sudden you're like you know what my
00:31:16.360 minnows way outweigh my whale and so I
00:31:18.799 don't have key customer risk anymore the
00:31:20.679 second way is that you lock this whale
00:31:23.120 in to a long-term contract so just think
00:31:25.799 about this whale as signing his life
00:31:27.399 away but you get Google or whatever this
00:31:29.399 customer is to sign a threeyear a 5year
00:31:32.360 a seven-year commitment and you can add
00:31:34.360 some bonuses in in there and say you're
00:31:36.120 going to have some dedicated reps or
00:31:37.519 you're going to have some sort of
00:31:38.799 discount that might be associated with
00:31:40.320 that kind of commitment but when they do
00:31:42.039 that then it makes it more stable
00:31:43.480 because it's unlikely that they're going
00:31:45.279 to leave and if you want to be smart
00:31:47.240 about this just a little Pro tip add a
00:31:48.960 little breakup Fe because some people
00:31:51.000 are still going to back out on their
00:31:52.480 agreement and you don't want to get into
00:31:53.760 a legal battle so you want to just give
00:31:55.360 them some way in the future but just
00:31:57.919 knowing that there's this nut that
00:31:59.240 they're going to have to pay will
00:32:01.080 prolong how long they'll stay with you
00:32:04.200 and so I would probably charge somewhere
00:32:06.440 in the neighborhood of 10 to 20% of the
00:32:08.919 contract now all the stuff's negotiable
00:32:10.799 as a breakup fee so if someone has a
00:32:12.960 5-year deal then I might say you got to
00:32:14.720 pay a year uh if you're going to break
00:32:16.480 up beforehand another way of thinking
00:32:18.279 about it is saying whatever discount I
00:32:20.039 give you you're going to have to pay to
00:32:21.399 make up that discount for the entirety
00:32:23.320 of the contract in order to leave the
00:32:25.440 contract another one is that they have
00:32:26.880 to give you six or 12 months of heads up
00:32:29.519 so there's a lot of ways that you can
00:32:30.880 write terms around this with a whale to
00:32:33.200 decrease the likelihood that they leave
00:32:35.240 and disrupt the business now that's path
00:32:37.360 number two the third path is and this is
00:32:40.399 my preferred path is you just get more
00:32:42.960 damn whales and then all of a sudden you
00:32:45.159 realize you know what dude I'm in the
00:32:47.600 whale business right why was I hunting
00:32:49.600 minnows look at the meat on these guys
00:32:51.720 right and so all of a sudden you don't
00:32:53.679 try to outnumber with minnows you make
00:32:56.399 all of a sudden you just go get five six
00:32:58.440 more whales and this isn't 10% or 20% of
00:33:02.000 your business so path four is a nasty
00:33:04.840 one and for many of you if this is your
00:33:06.960 situation it may actually be the right
00:33:09.279 path and I'll tell you a story to
00:33:10.240 illustrate it so there was a recruiting
00:33:12.080 firm that I was talking to and they had
00:33:13.559 grown a decent amount and they had this
00:33:15.240 Mondo contract that was on the horizon
00:33:17.559 and so they staffed for very specific
00:33:19.480 types of engineering roles that were
00:33:21.080 difficult to find so they definitely had
00:33:22.200 a niche that they had found and they had
00:33:23.840 some big whale come to them and say hey
00:33:26.200 we want you to staff US with 20 new
00:33:28.519 employees a month which was a big
00:33:30.559 contract for this firm so this firm was
00:33:31.919 probably doing $6 $700,000 a month and
00:33:33.720 so this would be like an additional
00:33:34.919 $200,000 a month that they were going to
00:33:36.519 be able to contract through this new
00:33:39.480 whale when they were asking how should
00:33:41.399 we negotiate this deal what pricing
00:33:43.760 should we put in there I thought about
00:33:45.600 it for a long time and I was like you
00:33:47.000 know what guys I think the actual best
00:33:49.039 move is to not do this deal because they
00:33:52.240 were going to have to basically change
00:33:54.120 the fundamentals of their business their
00:33:55.960 pricing their delivery the whale
00:33:57.799 demanded so many so many custom things
00:34:00.559 that were only going to be a use case
00:34:02.240 for them and were not going to service
00:34:03.679 the rest of their customers and they had
00:34:05.360 no way of reliably acquiring the whale
00:34:07.600 so I'll explain the difference so if the
00:34:10.040 whale comes in through a tried andr
00:34:12.520 Channel then this might make a ton of
00:34:15.000 sense but if you just get a random
00:34:16.520 referral or you just meet somebody you
00:34:18.320 work from your network building your
00:34:19.879 entire business around an unsustainable
00:34:22.079 or unpredictable way of getting this
00:34:24.399 type of customer is probably not smart
00:34:26.918 now if that recruiting firm had said hey
00:34:29.159 we just got our first whale but we have
00:34:30.839 a new way of getting whales then I say
00:34:33.320 oh this is the first whale of many this
00:34:35.800 makes sense but if this is just a random
00:34:38.119 lottery ticket that falls into your lap
00:34:40.119 you have to make the decision of what
00:34:41.960 business do I really want to be in and
00:34:43.760 what customer do I really want to serve
00:34:45.560 I think that this entrepreneur just saw
00:34:47.079 dollar signs in his eyes but didn't
00:34:48.960 calculate the cost of what it would mean
00:34:50.918 to his business and the disruption of
00:34:52.879 the main economic engine that he had
00:34:54.879 spent years putting together and so path
00:34:57.040 4 is you just realized that this whale
00:35:00.200 might be someone else's customer and you
00:35:02.160 let it swim on by and the fourth one and
00:35:05.280 this one is a crazy one that I've got a
00:35:06.680 story for you is single vendor risk so
00:35:11.359 this is where one vendor so think about
00:35:14.119 any person that's a business that you
00:35:16.000 pay to help you do business is
00:35:18.839 responsible for a key function of the
00:35:20.880 business and so there's a ton of
00:35:22.720 examples of this if you have all of your
00:35:24.680 customers from SEO for example and you
00:35:26.960 have an SEO who does it for you if you
00:35:28.920 have all your you know leads from PPC or
00:35:32.079 meta ads and somebody else has all of
00:35:33.760 that taken care of but they're an
00:35:34.960 outside company that is key vendor risk
00:35:38.680 unfortunately I've had this happen a lot
00:35:40.760 all right so with Prestige Labs I had
00:35:42.920 one manufacturer who made our products
00:35:45.960 we found out that he ended up stealing
00:35:47.560 about $400,000 in cash that I had sent
00:35:50.440 so and he kept asking for early and
00:35:52.480 earlier payment on stuff um to lock in
00:35:54.599 Greater discounts and in general if I
00:35:56.160 have cash and I can guarant a 10 or 20%
00:35:59.160 return on that money then it's almost
00:36:00.880 like I could put it in the stock market
00:36:02.800 but I know for sure I'm going to get 20%
00:36:04.560 discount for sure then it's like getting
00:36:06.520 a 20% return on the money guaranteed so
00:36:09.079 I'll take those deals when they come but
00:36:11.599 kept asking for it earlier and earlier
00:36:12.960 and earlier and when we just said hey
00:36:15.319 you know what it had been enough times
00:36:16.800 we're like why don't you just send us
00:36:18.079 what you owe us in terms of product all
00:36:20.880 of a sudden he couldn't because what he
00:36:22.960 had used is he was using our cash to run
00:36:25.560 his business rather than use it as an
00:36:27.720 account for the products and raw
00:36:29.960 materials that he needed to purchase for
00:36:32.119 our account obviously that was a big no
00:36:34.200 no and we were able to thankfully like
00:36:36.319 bridge to another provider and not
00:36:38.480 really Create A disruption but for
00:36:40.000 probably a period of 6 months we were
00:36:41.599 running out of product on a regular
00:36:44.240 basis and had like 3 Monon lead times
00:36:47.480 where we had to basically make this
00:36:48.760 transition and we lost a serious amount
00:36:50.359 of Revenue and that was a big hit both
00:36:52.040 to the revenue but also just reputation
00:36:54.079 because Prestige lab sold through
00:36:55.960 Affiliates it still does sell through
00:36:57.280 affili and during that period Affiliates
00:36:58.920 were like dude we can't sell half the
00:37:00.160 products we normally do cuz you don't
00:37:01.119 have them in stock and so that was very
00:37:02.839 tough and I learned that lesson Prestige
00:37:04.640 Labs which was a sub company that I
00:37:05.960 owned at about 20 million bucks a year
00:37:07.440 and I ended up selling that in that 42
00:37:09.200 million $46 million sale uh to American
00:37:11.800 Pacific group in 2021 Allen uh was a
00:37:14.440 third company that I started and sold in
00:37:16.280 2021 which was a company that helped
00:37:19.160 brick-and mortar businesses work their
00:37:21.160 leads through automated messaging and I
00:37:25.440 didn't understand how software worked at
00:37:26.960 the time and and so I just said cool I
00:37:28.920 know this problem I'm going to go hire
00:37:30.839 an Outsource Dev team to go build me
00:37:32.599 this software stack and they did and lo
00:37:35.920 and behold here's the crazy thing no one
00:37:38.000 on my team was any bit technological or
00:37:40.680 a developer and so 100% of the
00:37:42.760 development was happening in this
00:37:43.960 outside shop what do you think the
00:37:46.599 outside shop owner did when all of a
00:37:48.800 sudden this thing that he builts doing
00:37:51.160 500,000 800,000 a million 1.2 1.5 $ 1.7
00:37:56.359 million in sales all of a sudden
00:37:59.040 magically what was once $100,000 a month
00:38:01.680 in development became 200 300 $500,000 a
00:38:05.400 month of development because he could
00:38:06.800 see how much money we were making which
00:38:08.640 is why I'm such an advocate if if you
00:38:09.960 are going to start a software company
00:38:11.079 you want that person to be inh house at
00:38:12.880 least it be key man man risk that you
00:38:14.280 can control right but instead I had a
00:38:16.440 key vendor who literally designed and
00:38:18.960 built the entire product that I was
00:38:20.640 selling and so this guy had me buy the
00:38:22.800 balls there was nothing I could do and
00:38:25.240 so I had to start building an in-house
00:38:27.079 team in parallel without trying to like
00:38:29.839 let let him know that I'm doing this cuz
00:38:32.800 obviously he could see the writing on
00:38:34.040 the wall and then he was difficult to
00:38:35.359 work with and transferring the knowledge
00:38:36.640 over and it was a nightmare that was my
00:38:38.599 second big experience with this the
00:38:40.880 third you're like you should learn this
00:38:42.520 lesson you know what sometimes it takes
00:38:44.359 me a while uh another one was and I've
00:38:46.520 had multiple with this but payment
00:38:48.119 processor so in my first book $100
00:38:50.160 million offers I talk about how I lost
00:38:52.800 my payment processor and it was this
00:38:54.800 terrible experience for me because it
00:38:56.800 was the only problem I'd ever
00:38:58.200 encountered in my life that I couldn't
00:38:59.720 save with sales because no one would
00:39:01.800 process the money tldr I was running a
00:39:05.400 national business out of a brick and
00:39:07.400 mortar store that I had in Southern
00:39:09.280 California so I'm processing payments
00:39:10.839 out of Canada I'm processing payments
00:39:12.240 out of Mexico I'm processing payments
00:39:14.079 out of the United States all over the
00:39:15.760 country and they're like wait how is
00:39:17.079 this happening out of a little brick-and
00:39:18.720 mortar store in California I didn't know
00:39:20.520 how this worked I was 25 years old and
00:39:22.720 so I broke the rules and was unaware of
00:39:25.119 it and so they they held my processing
00:39:27.000 after that happened and you only need it
00:39:28.520 to happen once for every single business
00:39:30.800 that I've had afterwards I always have
00:39:32.599 redundancies in processing meaning I
00:39:34.920 have multiple processors that are
00:39:36.599 approved spun up and can handle the
00:39:38.480 entirety of my monthly volume at a
00:39:40.560 moment's notice this is also important
00:39:42.560 from a negotiating perspective because I
00:39:44.599 only had one payment processor I had no
00:39:47.160 ability to negotiate anything in terms
00:39:49.400 of my fees as well and so having
00:39:51.800 multiple there that are approved gave me
00:39:53.520 leverage with the relationship I got
00:39:55.079 better service and if for whatever
00:39:56.920 reason some something goes down I can
00:39:58.359 switch it over in a heartbeat and not
00:39:59.880 even miss miss miss anything now I had a
00:40:03.040 second occurrence with this later on in
00:40:05.640 my career where we did have redundancies
00:40:08.240 and the here was the issue I had a
00:40:10.000 recurring Revenue business and the
00:40:11.720 payment processor acted a little bit
00:40:13.480 Shady which is why I decided to shift
00:40:15.520 away from that specific processor and
00:40:18.400 they said oh if you want to transfer
00:40:20.520 away from us that's going to cost
00:40:22.400 $150,000 and I was like what and they're
00:40:24.720 like yeah it's just a lot of work to
00:40:26.200 transfer all those things over I was
00:40:27.640 like I'm pretty sure it's a button that
00:40:28.960 you click export the thing is is what
00:40:30.920 was I going to do I had multiple
00:40:32.599 Millions a month in recurring Revenue
00:40:34.440 across thousands of customers there was
00:40:36.720 nothing I could do it was basically
00:40:38.280 extortion I paid the bill and then I got
00:40:40.720 my I got all my customer information and
00:40:42.400 I transferred it to a more ethical
00:40:43.880 provider and so I bring these stories up
00:40:46.079 because I hope that you don't have to
00:40:48.440 live through each of these let's get to
00:40:50.000 the tactics for how to actually solve
00:40:52.359 against key vendor risk and I think this
00:40:53.720 one can be so nasty because it's one of
00:40:56.520 the only times where like the person on
00:40:58.040 the other side of the table has leverage
00:41:00.800 and if you don't have a good person on
00:41:02.800 the other side like they may use it and
00:41:05.040 they may try to put you out of business
00:41:06.520 or put you just as close to getting out
00:41:08.280 of business as they I mean they
00:41:10.119 basically can just blackmail you for
00:41:11.440 your own business and the amount they
00:41:13.079 can black you blackmail you for is
00:41:14.960 proportional to how much money you got
00:41:16.800 or at least how much money they think
00:41:17.960 you got so number one rule always have
00:41:21.079 backups for just about everything that's
00:41:22.839 important so you want to think about
00:41:24.160 this in terms of acquisition conversion
00:41:26.760 product and then the layer on top of
00:41:28.599 this obviously is processing banking
00:41:31.160 anything that you do that facilitates
00:41:33.079 transactions with customers and so the
00:41:35.119 big solution and we're going to put this
00:41:36.680 in big green letters so solution number
00:41:39.319 one is redundancy right now I want to be
00:41:42.920 clear about redundancy sometimes
00:41:45.200 redundancy looks like waste but is
00:41:47.720 actually Insurance the day you need it
00:41:50.200 think about it this way if I pay for
00:41:52.040 fire insurance and my house never
00:41:54.079 catches on fire if I knew for a fact
00:41:56.880 that my house would never catch on fire
00:41:58.359 then 100% of that money is completely
00:42:00.079 wasted I literally just flushed the
00:42:01.280 money down the toilet cuz I didn't get
00:42:02.480 anything for it if my house does catch
00:42:05.160 on fire the day it catches on fire every
00:42:07.920 one of those payments will 100% worth it
00:42:11.000 I see redundancy the same way which is
00:42:12.839 that it is insurance against existential
00:42:15.480 threats to the business and these are
00:42:17.760 the things that I'm telling you when I
00:42:19.960 now that I have these things in place
00:42:22.000 it's like one I have leverage in
00:42:23.800 negotiations which is probably the more
00:42:25.400 reasonable thing that you get in terms
00:42:26.720 of short term benefits of having
00:42:28.079 redundancy the second is that you sleep
00:42:29.800 great at night knowing that your
00:42:31.200 business can't get taken down at least
00:42:32.880 from the things that you know about like
00:42:34.480 listen you can't control the unknown
00:42:36.119 unknowns but at least control the knowns
00:42:38.599 if the chickens do come home to roost
00:42:41.119 and you do have that bad day and the
00:42:42.920 bill is due then you will be grateful
00:42:45.200 that you had this redundancy in place
00:42:46.839 the second way of doing this is having
00:42:49.440 mutually ensured destruction so what
00:42:51.960 does that even mean it basically means
00:42:53.559 that if the bigger you get the bigger
00:42:56.440 you are as a percentage of their
00:42:57.880 business the more they need to keep your
00:42:59.800 business and not let you go because
00:43:02.640 basically you shift from them being uh
00:43:05.240 key vendor risk to you becoming key
00:43:07.200 customer risk for them and so it's the
00:43:08.880 shift in power basically the bigger you
00:43:10.800 get the more important you are to them
00:43:13.079 and so there's this saying in the
00:43:14.480 finance world where it's like if you owe
00:43:16.040 a bank a million dollars they own you if
00:43:18.400 you owe a bank a billion dollars you own
00:43:20.359 them right now obviously depends on the
00:43:22.160 size of the bank and things like that
00:43:23.599 but the saying kind of kind of carries
00:43:26.200 right and so you want to understand
00:43:27.200 understand what percentage of the
00:43:27.960 business their business you are and that
00:43:30.720 way if they you they get too
00:43:33.760 so this is where the size of the person
00:43:35.599 that you're working with can be kind of
00:43:36.920 a double-edged sword the small guys are
00:43:38.960 probably the guys that are most likely
00:43:40.240 to do the Shady stuff on the other hand
00:43:41.960 if you become a huge percentage of their
00:43:43.359 business you have some leverage back
00:43:45.319 towards them and so redundancy number
00:43:47.680 one mutually insured destruction number
00:43:49.400 two and here's a big one Covenant and
00:43:51.400 terms all right so I'll just
00:43:53.240 say which are just fancy ways of saying
00:43:55.599 what do we agree to kind of like key
00:43:57.480 customers because key customer and key
00:43:58.920 vendor are kind of opposite sides of the
00:44:00.440 same coin all the terms that we asked
00:44:02.319 from our customers before in the last
00:44:04.359 section for mistakes we also can ask now
00:44:06.760 as the customer of the vendor so we say
00:44:08.760 hey if you want to stop doing business
00:44:10.359 with us you have to give us a 6 or 12
00:44:12.000 month lead time to letting us know that
00:44:14.000 that's going to occur so that we can
00:44:15.160 find another vendor so this number one
00:44:16.880 is lead time number two is you can have
00:44:19.040 a breakup fee Associated now you can
00:44:20.680 imagine on the other side as a vendor
00:44:22.079 you're like this guy wants to put a
00:44:23.359 breakup fee on me my God this guy's
00:44:25.000 going to be sticky but at this point
00:44:26.640 when you have key components of the
00:44:28.720 business that are outsourced which I I
00:44:30.319 fundamentally don't do this anymore
00:44:32.160 because I have been screwed so many
00:44:33.800 times which is why I think that
00:44:35.079 Marketing sales delivery should be
00:44:37.480 inhouse to a business because it's just
00:44:39.440 too important but like Payment
00:44:41.839 Processing it's unlikely you're going to
00:44:43.200 start a payment processing but just to
00:44:44.280 be able to process your own payments
00:44:45.400 right there are some things that are
00:44:46.200 going to be outsourced you have to have
00:44:47.280 trust one is give the heads up two is
00:44:50.760 the breakup fee third is that you have
00:44:53.440 fees or fines associated with service
00:44:55.640 level agreements meaning you're going to
00:44:57.920 respond to us on this timeline you're
00:45:00.319 going to ship to us products or raw
00:45:02.400 materials on this schedule you're going
00:45:04.119 to get us Le or run this amount of ads
00:45:06.240 on this Cadence and when we think about
00:45:08.040 it that way that allows to say if you
00:45:09.880 don't do those things then you hedge the
00:45:12.200 amount of money that you would have lost
00:45:14.040 as a result of them not doing the work
00:45:16.040 with the fine associat it's basically a
00:45:18.079 hedge now if you have a vendor they're
00:45:20.680 going to try and decrease what that
00:45:21.920 amount of money is but them also having
00:45:24.160 transparency into understanding how
00:45:26.480 important their role is is again a
00:45:28.240 double-edged sword one is they'll
00:45:29.920 understand leverage on the other hand if
00:45:31.359 you get the term inside the deal in
00:45:33.079 terms of the cash required from them to
00:45:35.520 make sure that they're doing their job
00:45:37.040 you cover your downside finally and this
00:45:39.160 is a bit of like a advanced move if you
00:45:41.720 become significantly bigger than they
00:45:43.599 are or you're a huge percentage of their
00:45:45.319 business and they're still important to
00:45:46.880 you that's where things like Aqua hires
00:45:49.359 and Acquisitions can be very strategic
00:45:52.240 so you say hey under what circumstances
00:45:54.480 would you like to do what you do inside
00:45:56.040 of our company is there a way that we
00:45:57.760 could work together more permanently and
00:45:59.319 then you permanently align the
00:46:00.480 incentives if they're doing a good job
00:46:01.920 now if they're doing a terrible job then
00:46:03.000 you obviously want to do that but this
00:46:04.520 is how I think through we're reducing
00:46:06.680 risk with key vendors who are core to
00:46:10.800 how we make money and if they were to
00:46:12.720 disappear so too would our business and
00:46:15.119 so once this happens you get your
00:46:17.359 Superman
00:46:18.800 cape and then all of a sudden this
00:46:21.839 becomes a fist a Fist of Fury if you
00:46:25.160 will and then you can this this is a
00:46:27.240 dotted line because you can fly and you
00:46:29.319 realize that you didn't even need the
00:46:30.640 bridge to begin with because you're such
00:46:32.040 a good business owner and then you go
00:46:33.640 take the money and save the world or do
00:46:37.760 whatever Superman would do with $ 46.2
00:46:39.400 million which would probably be you know
00:46:41.400 try to double down and make a lot more
00:46:43.720 so that he could actually make a
00:46:44.760 difference in the world rather than just
00:46:46.319 his own life I've talked to over a
00:46:48.240 thousand business owners in person this
00:46:51.000 year I compiled the six most common
00:46:54.359 mistakes that prevent small businesses
00:46:56.359 from becoming big businesses and I made
00:46:58.599 a whole video about it so if you're
00:47:00.160 stuck this is for you
