00:00:00.240 the single most valuable skill set you
00:00:01.680 can have is getting other people to do
00:00:03.080 things for you because fundamentally if
00:00:04.400 you know how to do that then you can get
00:00:05.960 somebody else to do every other portion
00:00:07.439 of the business and they can build it on
00:00:08.599 your behalf and so in this video I'll
00:00:10.719 walk through an in-depth process of how
00:00:12.719 I think about managing people to get the
00:00:15.599 desired outcome on a consistent basis
00:00:17.840 and how to have some of the hardest
00:00:19.359 conversations you have to have and make
00:00:20.720 it feel easy so let me show you
00:00:22.039 something that I haven't done in any
00:00:23.119 other school days but I'll I'll walk you
00:00:24.560 through it so I just call this like my
00:00:26.039 Management
00:00:27.560 Diamond so fundamentally if you ask
00:00:30.000 someone to do something you want them to
00:00:31.720 do it if they're not doing it then comes
00:00:34.160 the problem solving right which is
00:00:38.200 what
00:00:40.120 how when
00:00:51.079 oops okay so if someone doesn't do what
00:00:54.840 you want them to do the first and
00:00:56.480 obvious reason they didn't know what you
00:00:57.719 wanted them to do and so you fix this
00:00:59.680 one communication this is by the way a
00:01:01.879 really good framework for having hard
00:01:03.399 conversations when someone's not doing a
00:01:05.040 good job so you say hey
00:01:07.080 Carly I wanted you to do this and you
00:01:09.240 haven't done it so I just want to figure
00:01:10.840 out what the reason was so we can solve
00:01:12.360 it or make it less likely to happen in
00:01:13.720 the future so I figured the first was
00:01:15.200 that you didn't know that I wanted you
00:01:16.479 to do that did you know that I wanted
00:01:17.880 you to do that if they say no I didn't
00:01:19.720 know then you're like great now you
00:01:22.360 know right now if they're like I did
00:01:25.079 know that you wanted me to do that then
00:01:26.119 you're like oh did you not know how to
00:01:27.880 do it which you solve with
00:01:31.720 training which we'll dovetail into the
00:01:33.920 whole teaching thing in a second but
00:01:36.119 okay yes I did know that you wanted me
00:01:38.560 to do it and I know how to do it but I
00:01:41.720 didn't know you wanted it by now or by
00:01:43.600 tomorrow and so I didn't have a deadline
00:01:45.520 here so we assign deadlines when we tell
00:01:47.119 people to do
00:01:48.200 things and that's just again to hold
00:01:50.159 them responsible now if someone knows
00:01:51.719 what you want them to do they know how
00:01:52.600 to do it and there's a deadline
00:01:53.479 associate and they still don't do it
00:01:55.280 then the question is do they need some
00:01:57.119 sort of incentive were they not
00:01:58.240 motivated to do it or was something
00:02:00.560 blocking them I could have the best chef
00:02:01.920 in the world who's the most motivated
00:02:03.039 know that I want to make an omelet knows
00:02:04.520 how to do it knows I want it in the next
00:02:05.840 five minutes he's like bro I don't have
00:02:07.920 eggs doesn't matter how much I do like
00:02:10.720 sometimes people don't have like we
00:02:11.760 actually had this issue with my editing
00:02:14.000 team was I was like why don't you all
00:02:15.599  edit in the building and they're
00:02:16.879 like the upload speed they're like my
00:02:19.200 upload speed at home is faster than here
00:02:20.720 and so it actually just takes me more
00:02:21.879 time and so we paid Google Fiber to
00:02:24.319 drill a hole into the wall and
00:02:25.840 here we are now they can up it's faster
00:02:27.239 here now right but it's fundamentally
00:02:29.599 like if there are blockers then it's
00:02:30.800 like okay well can I just solve whatever
00:02:32.239 that blocker is can I remove that
00:02:33.440 impediment and so walking through this
00:02:37.160 has helped me have a lot of hard
00:02:38.760 conversations with people and not make
00:02:40.360 them hard it's like there's five reasons
00:02:43.000 that you didn't do it you didn't know
00:02:44.519 what it was how to do it when I wanted
00:02:46.120 it you were't incentivize or something's
00:02:47.720 blocking you any of these sound familiar
00:02:49.480 and if there's more than one then you
00:02:50.440 got to fix more than one and often times
00:02:52.640 if you
00:02:53.519 delegate if you basically you hand
00:02:55.400 something off to somebody and it gets
00:02:57.200 worse after you hand it off it's because
00:02:59.040 you didn't delegate it advocated it you
00:03:00.920 just said here you go good
00:03:03.080 luck and so that's a very easy litmus
00:03:05.440 test if you hand it off and it gets
00:03:06.799 better or it's neutral then you actually
00:03:08.480 delegated it and so what happens is most
00:03:10.200 entrepreneurs just find a human being
00:03:11.799 that has a pulse say they have a meeting
00:03:14.159 like this and just say a lot of things
00:03:15.480 at them expect the person to have 100%
00:03:17.599 retention and know exactly what to do
00:03:19.480 when they want to do it how they want it
00:03:20.760 done with no blockages the person's not
00:03:23.120 aware of and then be done be like oh
00:03:27.599 yeah I already I told him once it's like
00:03:30.319 yeah once not in a written format in no
00:03:33.120 structured form like and then you're
00:03:34.599 just yelling at them on a zoom call and
00:03:36.519 then two weeks later you're surprised
00:03:37.680 that they're not doing as well as you
00:03:39.000 after having done it for years
00:03:41.319 you know what I mean so we we think
00:03:44.439 through this and this is how I think
00:03:45.480 through um trying to figure out um
00:03:47.879 employee issues so this one's fairly
00:03:50.560 straightforward I my opinion this one's
00:03:53.400 fairly straightforward the two hard ones
00:03:55.319 are these guys so from a training
00:03:58.200 perspective I'll give you I'll give you
00:03:59.959 an example I had to do recently with um
00:04:02.200 a teammate or an employee here um I'll
00:04:05.239 just give
00:04:06.840 a so let's say there's somebody on your
00:04:08.840 team who's a dick right you're like hey
00:04:11.920 Caroline you're being a
00:04:13.560 dick um the thing is is that stop being
00:04:17.560 a dick is actually a pretty terrible
00:04:19.040 directive and the reason is because they
00:04:20.839 don't know what they're doing because
00:04:21.839 they're dicks they're like you just want
00:04:23.960 me to not be me and you're like kind of
00:04:26.600 and so what we have to do is so I call
00:04:28.880 it bundling and un bundling terms and
00:04:30.880 this is fundamentally why I think my
00:04:32.199 content does better than most people's
00:04:34.720 is
00:04:36.080 that like you've heard me to find terms
00:04:38.520 it's like okay patience is figuring out
00:04:40.000 what to do in the meantime so if I told
00:04:41.400 someone be patient it doesn't mean
00:04:43.639 anything if I say be
00:04:45.240 charismatic how do I be charismatic it's
00:04:48.000 like okay I need you to have more uh
00:04:50.600 vocal ranges when you're talking I need
00:04:52.120 you to pause for emphasis I need you to
00:04:55.120 say people's name I need you to look
00:04:56.280 them in the eyes I need you to nod when
00:04:57.479 they're talking like these are a series
00:04:58.960 of activities that when someone does all
00:05:00.919 of them we bundle them together and say
00:05:02.880 this person's charismatic and so rather
00:05:05.080 than saying be charismatic say I need
00:05:06.479 you do these six
00:05:08.199 things or stop doing these six things
00:05:10.520 that you are
00:05:11.440 doing and by doing that then people will
00:05:13.880 stop describing you as a dick and so we
00:05:16.560 had um so a teammate who's really high
00:05:19.560 potential like really smart hardworking
00:05:21.639 did all that stuff but something started
00:05:24.120 happening and it started acting a little
00:05:25.280 bit dickish and we had four leaders in
00:05:28.720 my company have like sit down talks
00:05:30.400 which normally wouldn't do but the
00:05:31.319 person was really good at their job like
00:05:33.039 I don't really want to lose the
00:05:34.120 productivity and so I was the last stop
00:05:36.759 I was like it's me or you're out so we
00:05:39.720 got to figure something out here and
00:05:41.039 he'd already been given a lot of
00:05:42.680 instruction a lot of don't be a dick be
00:05:44.880 nicer things like that but that doesn't
00:05:46.800 help anyone change their behavior and so
00:05:49.120 fundamentally giving someone a frame of
00:05:50.880 what I want to have happen as a result
00:05:52.319 of this conversation helps fil or what
00:05:54.080 you're actually talking to them about
00:05:55.600 and so like me insulting them or making
00:05:57.120 them feel bad doesn't actually do
00:05:58.400 anything for increasing the likelihood
00:06:00.080 that they behave in a certain way most
00:06:01.680 of the time it's just Clarity just like
00:06:03.600 when you hop on the call and you tell
00:06:06.120 people to do this stuff immediately they
00:06:08.280 will not like you and if they don't like
00:06:09.919 you they'll complain more which makes it
00:06:11.160 more like you get fired you don't want
00:06:12.280 to get fired great so all you have to do
00:06:14.319 is not do that at the beginning of the
00:06:15.479 calls people stop describing you that
00:06:17.080 way he's like this is so eye opening I
00:06:19.039 didn't even know and there was like four
00:06:20.479 or five other items that I'd asked for
00:06:22.039 specific examples so that I could say
00:06:23.520 like stop doing these things and people
00:06:25.680 stop calling you a dick and within a
00:06:27.720 month people were people were like dude
00:06:29.000 he's completely turned around it's like
00:06:30.360 he just actually had Specific
00:06:31.599 Instructions and so most of us aren't
00:06:33.360 willing to do the hard work of saying
00:06:35.199 like what is this person doing or what
00:06:37.840 does this person need to do which is why
00:06:39.280 I'm a big fan of checklist because it's
00:06:40.960 like this is what you have to do when
00:06:43.080 you onboard someone like check your hair
00:06:45.639 make sure that there's not a bed in the
00:06:47.400 background like I'm like yeah you're
00:06:51.199 onboarding a customer and it's got like
00:06:52.440 you know a pink bunny poster behind you
00:06:53.880 and it's like that's probably not the
00:06:54.919 first impression I'm really looking for
00:06:56.919 right so it's like these are the
00:06:58.080 checklists that you go through it's like
00:06:59.240 first you greet them by name second you
00:07:00.800 look at the notes and you tell them
00:07:02.160 about the goal and then when you took a
00:07:04.120 recording of the onboarding call it's
00:07:05.479 like why does Sarah suck and Caroline's
00:07:07.160 great just say well Sarah here's the
00:07:09.560 checklist you did three there's 11 items
00:07:12.199 Sarah consistently or Caroline does you
00:07:14.400 know nine out of 11 and hers
00:07:15.919 consistently get higher scores now if
00:07:18.120 she if Sarah follows the checklist and
00:07:21.520 she does all 11 and her scores are way
00:07:24.759 below the other girls then it means the
00:07:27.039 checklist is wrong which means that's on
00:07:28.560 you not on her and so it means that
00:07:30.319 you're incomplete in terms of what
00:07:31.319 you're trying to train them on and so
00:07:32.800 sometimes it's useful to know that so if
00:07:34.080 both people do the checklist and they
00:07:35.120 objectively meet the things then there's
00:07:36.479 other things that you don't know about
00:07:38.120 and so
00:07:39.639 fundamentally soft skills and hard
00:07:41.800 skills are all just skills it's just
00:07:44.039 that soft skills people just have a
00:07:45.919 harder time teaching because it's
00:07:47.639 bundled language and I think that's why
00:07:50.199 so many people struggle teaching
00:07:52.680 them so in training the team to loop
00:07:56.400 back to your question I want to figure
00:07:58.319 out what the problem is with the person
00:07:59.919 so I can try and loop to these things if
00:08:01.919 it's a training issue I try and break it
00:08:03.599 down as much as I humanly can if it's a
00:08:05.639 motivation issue um it really comes down
00:08:08.560 to reinforcing stimuli so either people
00:08:10.759 do things that uh because they get stuff
00:08:12.919 that they like or they avoid things they
00:08:14.479 hate getting fired is usually a pretty
00:08:16.400 aversive stimulus so a lot of people
00:08:17.800 will do things to just not get fired so
00:08:20.159 it's fairly strong um but the best
00:08:23.199 performers do it do things because they
00:08:25.000 just like doing them like the best
00:08:26.159 employees the best teammates they just
00:08:27.599 work all the time because the actual
00:08:29.599 conditions of work are more reinforcing
00:08:31.080 than any boss can be right which is why
00:08:33.240 a lot of people like on my team for
00:08:34.440 example with like a lot of editors and
00:08:36.080 whatnot they just edit in their free
00:08:37.240 time they picked up editing because
00:08:38.519 editing itself is a reinforcing thing no
00:08:40.880 one call cold calls in their free time
00:08:43.519 oh yeah I just picked up cold calling on
00:08:44.920 the side yeah I just cold call like on
00:08:47.320 my days off just because I just like it
00:08:48.959 like no one says that uh but the thing
00:08:51.200 is is that sales and editing have very
00:08:52.920 fast feedback loops and so you can
00:08:54.800 immediately get off the call and get a
00:08:56.000 reward you immediately get you see an
00:08:57.600 edit and or you catch a moment and
00:08:59.240 there's there's this F A lot of feedback
00:09:00.920 loops that are really tight and good
00:09:02.600 other roles have slower and longer
00:09:04.800 feedback cycles and so as a manager you
00:09:08.000 have to basically artificially input
00:09:10.360 more feedback loops into longer project
00:09:13.519 timelines or jobs that require more
00:09:15.680 complex tasks
00:09:17.959 um that motivate people through
00:09:21.000 reinforcement and so a lot of people I
00:09:22.800 think in culture say oh someone did
00:09:25.160 something crazy and so what we do is we
00:09:27.600 say what happened that caused them to do
00:09:29.200 it
00:09:30.120 but we actually invert how Behavior
00:09:31.920 Works which is people do things because
00:09:34.279 of what happens after they do them not
00:09:36.279 because what happened
00:09:37.959 before and so that's like what happens
00:09:41.079 after you do stuff is the latency of
00:09:42.839 training and that's how you train people
00:09:44.800 and so anyways I I I ge out on human
00:09:46.519 behavior stuff a lot but um motivation
00:09:49.399 fundamentally comes from deprivation
00:09:51.079 which is what are you most deprived of
00:09:53.160 so if someone who's very deprived of
00:09:55.560 Praise which many people are giving
00:09:57.640 praise motivates them if someone gets
00:10:00.160 praise all the time praise might not
00:10:02.000 motivate them just depends on the person
00:10:04.760 and so this is figuring out what are the
00:10:06.760 reinforcing stimuli from someone's past
00:10:09.320 that's getting to know your employees
00:10:10.640 better so you can do the things that
00:10:12.320 motivate
00:10:13.360 them money by the way has been
00:10:16.200 conditioned as a universal uh reinforcer
00:10:19.120 we've learned at an early age that this
00:10:20.560 thing equals whatever we want so it's
00:10:22.200 just a generalized reinforcer but there
00:10:24.079 are more specific reinforc that you can
00:10:25.519 give to individual
00:10:27.440 people so yeah that's that's that and
00:10:29.680 then block you just unblock the thing if
00:10:31.279 you can afford it whatever the problem
00:10:32.920 is so um that's my little Manifesto on
00:10:36.800 management if that helped out okay cool
00:10:40.480 oh great Where do you um where do you
00:10:43.600 find like more information to better
00:10:46.440 understand these Concepts because we're
00:10:47.519 in a very in like human capital
00:10:49.440 intensive industry management is the the
00:10:52.560 big piece that's missing for like every
00:10:54.760 company and that's why so many people
00:10:56.800 fail where would I find like this in
00:11:00.360 more depth and in more volume so that I
00:11:02.200 can understand these Concepts better so
00:11:04.120 I've got a special CTA for you today uh
00:11:06.920 this exerpt was from a school day so
00:11:08.880 this is from the school winners who came
00:11:11.720 out they were the top 10 and they asked
00:11:13.160 me about managing team and so I answered
00:11:14.800 that question but if you don't have a
00:11:17.399 business then none of that matters and
00:11:19.480 so to start a business you can go to
00:11:21.120 school.com we run the school games it's
00:11:22.800 for people who are just getting started
00:11:24.760 in business and that's what that's for
00:11:27.120 if you already have a business and you
00:11:28.720 have a big team and you want to scale
00:11:30.200 your team we run workshops occasionally
00:11:32.519 at acquisition. at our headquarters here
00:11:34.440 in Vegas and so if you'd like to partake
00:11:36.440 in one of our workshops you can go there
00:11:38.120 and click the scale button and uh
00:11:39.800 hopefully we'll see you soon so most of
00:11:41.320 these Concepts were derived from the
00:11:42.560 ground up from just like rat studies
00:11:44.639 with Dr cashy Who Sam Sam knows my my
00:11:47.399 good buddy and so um I think most
00:11:50.880 people just do a lot of things and just
00:11:53.480 like see what happens like it's very
00:11:55.040 halfhazard I think almost no one knows
00:11:57.240 how to train period I feel I feel like
00:12:01.040 understanding human psychology like that
00:12:03.120 was always my found even ignore
00:12:04.560 psychology really I completely ignore it
00:12:06.880 I I would say that you talk a lot about
00:12:08.680 it like you probably never heard me say
00:12:10.760 the word psychology not the word
00:12:12.120 psychology but what you're maybe I'm
00:12:13.839 blanking it right so so to get no I
00:12:16.680 don't want to get too far into that
00:12:17.720 because I will go there but um so this
00:12:20.440 is this is like for everyone like if you
00:12:22.360 want to basically have your
00:12:24.519 ometer always turned on it's separating
00:12:27.880 out when people give reasons because
00:12:30.800 statements or just blank statements of
00:12:33.000 like the other day somebody was like
00:12:34.800 there's only three ways that you can you
00:12:36.160 know make a customer worth more and then
00:12:37.560 they and then they continue the sentence
00:12:38.880 I was like that's just false they just
00:12:40.800 started the statement that way and a lot
00:12:42.000 of people make statements that are just
00:12:43.320 false they have no idea what they're
00:12:45.040 saying and so we walk through a
00:12:47.079 framework when we're trying to basically
00:12:48.680 detect
00:12:55.760  which is logic evidence utility
00:12:58.320 which is what does this mean
00:13:02.320 how do you
00:13:05.320 know and then so
00:13:08.320 what so I'll give you an example so I
00:13:12.040 had um I had someone the other day say
00:13:15.279 I'm stressed because I'm lonely and I
00:13:18.880 was
00:13:19.600 like okay I was
00:13:22.880 like what does lonely mean to you it's a
00:13:25.399 bucketed term right it's a bundled
00:13:27.399 term he was like well I was like that on
00:13:30.680 Friday night you have known to text or
00:13:32.519 that people don't respond back to you or
00:13:34.240 like what what is the what what does
00:13:36.519 that mean to you because it's there's a
00:13:38.639 thing there's an activity that occurred
00:13:40.000 and then they described it they chunk it
00:13:41.399 up as loneliness but when you get two
00:13:43.639 steps below that of to like what
00:13:44.959 occurred what was the action that got
00:13:46.959 stunted or something that you wanted
00:13:48.519 that you didn't get then you can get a
00:13:50.000 lot more specific we're like okay so
00:13:52.279 then I say all right so that was the
00:13:54.199 lonely occurrence now have you been
00:13:57.519 stressed before when that wasn't
00:14:00.360 happening yes okay so then how do you
00:14:03.560 know that that thing has anything to do
00:14:05.160 with your stress they're completely
00:14:07.639 decoupled right it's like all right
00:14:11.360 and who cares you're stressed have you
00:14:14.839 been stressed when things are going well
00:14:16.480 yes have you been stressed when things
00:14:17.399 are not going well yes so in general
00:14:19.639 you're stressed when you're alive noted
00:14:22.199 what's your point right and so we like
00:14:25.160 breaking this down allows you to just be
00:14:26.639 less confused about what other people
00:14:28.120 say and so the reason I'm going here is
00:14:31.079 because most people are full of not
00:14:34.279 purposefully not maliciously they just
00:14:36.000 don't know any better and so they just
00:14:37.920 like paired out other things they talk
00:14:39.839 about pop psychology whatever and I for
00:14:42.920 the most part have just erased feelings
00:14:45.440 intentions beliefs all of these words
00:14:47.959 from my vocabulary in terms of what
00:14:49.519 influenc his behavior because I just
00:14:51.600 only focus on what can we observe
00:14:53.360 because if I were to say this guy is
00:14:54.440 really motivated I'd say how do you know
00:14:56.959 what does motivation mean to you I said
00:14:59.320 can you motivate me I was like Define
00:15:00.560 motivation and she just like stood there
00:15:01.880 and melted and I was like right so you
00:15:03.279 want me to answer a question that you
00:15:04.560 can't Define the word for so what's the
00:15:06.320 likely that you get what you want really
00:15:08.360 low and so the thing is is we ask
00:15:10.680 questions about stuff all the time we
00:15:11.759 can't Define which means maybe we need
00:15:13.279 to ask better questions or at least know
00:15:14.360 what the we're talking about and so
00:15:17.759 anyways I bring this up
00:15:19.920 because if you going back to the
00:15:22.360 motivation thing if I say this person's
00:15:24.600 really motivated you'd say how do you
00:15:26.120 know it's like well they do all the
00:15:27.480 stuff it's like great then forget about
00:15:29.240 concept or label of motivation and just
00:15:30.880 say this person does these things great
00:15:33.560 and so I don't care if you feel
00:15:35.839 motivated or not if you do these
00:15:37.319 activities people describe you that way
00:15:39.880 and if you do these activities when I
00:15:41.319 had the conversation with the the dick
00:15:43.399 in particular right I said I want to be
00:15:45.319 clear I don't care if you're a dick I
00:15:47.399 don't care if you hate everyone as long
00:15:49.440 as you behave this way doesn't matter to
00:15:51.480 me and so a lot of people spend all this
00:15:53.360 time trying to be like there's these
00:15:54.680 seven stages of awareness I'm like how
00:15:56.279 do you know
00:15:59.160 how do you know that what's your
00:16:00.519 evidence for that and so what like what
00:16:03.360 are the activities someone has to do
00:16:04.839 okay they have to see your ad great then
00:16:07.440 they have to interact with it in some
00:16:09.480 way they have to take an action so if
00:16:10.800 you go through the leads book I walk
00:16:11.880 through the lead stages in the book and
00:16:13.639 it's only based on the observable they
00:16:15.959 took a step then they give you their
00:16:17.519 information they give you means to
00:16:18.600 contact them then after you have means
00:16:20.240 to contact like you these are the things
00:16:21.720 that like no one can like fight me like
00:16:23.680 these are the things that have to occur
00:16:25.240 and so if you if you reason up from what
00:16:28.120 can I observe with with my eyes it makes
00:16:29.880 life a lot
00:16:30.959 easier even when you're talking to like
00:16:34.040 a spouse you're like okay I'm really
00:16:36.600 upset like okay what does that mean
00:16:39.839 right now how do you know you're upset
00:16:41.680 and so what what do you want me to do
00:16:44.519 about it and so then you say like when
00:16:47.160 you say this what do you want me to do
00:16:49.880 when you say like if someone says like
00:16:52.319 you should know it's like oh I'll play
00:16:53.959 that game I'm hungry either means you
00:16:57.680 would like me to go get you food you
00:16:59.480 would like us to go get food together it
00:17:01.440 could mean that you want space it could
00:17:03.680 mean you're in a bad mood I was like but
00:17:05.119 I won't take one Q for six behaviors
00:17:07.280 pick and then it makes things a lot
00:17:09.280 easier and so you can start training
00:17:12.839 real realistically like anyone in your
00:17:14.760 company to behave a certain way by just
00:17:16.640 saying when you say this what do you
00:17:17.679 want to have
00:17:18.640 happen and also when you're having the
00:17:20.520 conversation with staff or employees or
00:17:22.599 whatever like sometimes we in in the
00:17:24.720 moment like someone disrespects you you
00:17:26.000 want to like immediately insult them or
00:17:27.559 whatever right but you're like okay
00:17:29.559 well what do I want to have happen well
00:17:31.679 if I insult them they're going to be
00:17:34.080 more resistant to me in the future but I
00:17:36.039 need to have more influence over them
00:17:37.360 not less so me counter punishing to
00:17:40.559 prevent their their thing in the future
00:17:42.679 it's probably going to be
00:17:43.600 counterproductive and so what can I say
00:17:45.720 that increases the likelihood that what
00:17:46.799 I want to have happen happens and so
00:17:48.559 it's like taking a second step forward
00:17:50.280 and me back to think what's two the
00:17:52.559 second order of magnitude effect on
00:17:54.000 their behavior rather than what I feel
00:17:55.520 like doing in the moment um and so when
00:17:59.360 you're trying to look for okay how do I
00:18:01.559 manage people better or how do I train
00:18:04.080 people better most training is just not
00:18:07.120 chunk down far enough and so the people
00:18:10.200 who are successful in whatever your
00:18:11.679 education thing is come in more
00:18:15.720 qualified than other people like have
00:18:17.400 you ever had a student or a customer who
00:18:19.120 you're like this guy's going to win no
00:18:20.240 matter what right it's not you it's
00:18:22.200 because of them because they have a
00:18:23.840 history of skill they have a larger
00:18:25.480 skill set um that they bring to the
00:18:27.400 table and so fundamental
00:18:29.880 the people who are successful with your
00:18:31.240 program are lacking the things you teach
00:18:33.919 the people who are not successful lack
00:18:35.799 those things and other things and so to
00:18:38.679 have the most comprehensive training you
00:18:40.480 would have to start with here's how you
00:18:43.120 write words here's how you type here's
00:18:45.520 how the internet works of course you're
00:18:47.200 not going to do that because there's a
00:18:48.280 base assumption which is what qualifies
00:18:49.960 someone to be a customer of a certain
00:18:51.600 level of skills it also works the same
00:18:53.400 way with an employee there's certain
00:18:54.840 level of skills that are required to
00:18:56.400 work for this role and so if someone
00:18:59.280 does have a deficiency then the question
00:19:00.919 is what's the return on effort I think I
00:19:02.640 could teach someone who has Down
00:19:03.679 syndrome to be a neuros a neurosurgeon
00:19:05.679 well I could but somebody could right it
00:19:07.600 just might take 30 years it's probably
00:19:09.080 not worth it because for the same
00:19:10.400 resources we get 2,000 other
00:19:12.159 neurosurgeons who don't have Down
00:19:13.480 syndrome right and so if you think about
00:19:17.080 your customers that way it's like and
00:19:18.880 simply thinking about like take out
00:19:20.159 character traits take out beliefs
00:19:22.120 whatever it's just I need them to behave
00:19:24.400 this way that's it just break it down to
00:19:27.000 the activities and it makes a lot easier
00:19:28.760 and so fundamentally it's like I wish I
00:19:30.240 were more charismatic I wish more
00:19:32.200 patient I wish I were more confident if
00:19:34.440 you just debundled those things and just
00:19:37.600 say how do I break this down to the
00:19:39.640 smallest level and how do I just do
00:19:41.240 those activities it makes it a lot
00:19:42.640 easier and so usually when training does
00:19:44.440 not work it's because we made an
00:19:46.679 assumption of a skill set that they
00:19:48.559 didn't have and so the more advanced
00:19:50.360 someone is the vager the instruction can
00:19:51.960 be so I can say or Sam can say hey man
00:19:55.640 you think you just Market school I say
00:19:57.240 sure
00:19:58.840 that's it that's the directive it's not
00:20:00.360 like okay do you think you can make this
00:20:02.039 many pieces of content you think you
00:20:03.159 could run this many pieces of AD or like
00:20:05.039 whatever it is right and if I'm like hey
00:20:07.240 think you make an amazing product keep
00:20:08.760 making he's like sure like it's not like
00:20:11.080 do you think you'd have an activation
00:20:12.480 sequence an onboarding are we're going
00:20:13.640 to do these things I like I trust that
00:20:15.240 he's to do it because he has the skill
00:20:16.280 set you trust that I can do it because I
00:20:17.480 have the skill set and so fundamentally
00:20:19.440 the more skilled the person is the
00:20:20.640 bigger the instruction can
00:20:22.240 be and so if you have lowl people you
00:20:25.320 don't have a lot of room for vagueness
00:20:26.520 so you have to be more specifically your
00:20:27.640 instruction as people get higher and
00:20:29.000 higher up in your organization you can
00:20:30.480 be vager and vager with the instruction
00:20:31.640 because they have more
00:20:33.720 skills and so experts fundamentally just
00:20:36.720 have more ways to be rewarded within the
00:20:39.320 same
00:20:41.159 context like if you're really good at
00:20:42.960 editing video then you have many things
00:20:44.720 that reward you because you have more
00:20:45.840 skills if you're really bad at it
00:20:47.440 there's very few things that reward you
00:20:49.720 and so that's what Mastery development
00:20:51.080 is
