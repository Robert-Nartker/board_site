# How to Grow Your Business SO Fast in 2025 It Feels ILLEGAL
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/HxEQCHpZzHk

00:00:00.160 the last three companies I founded and
00:00:01.640 sold grew so fast it felt illegal us
00:00:04.520 Allen got to $1.2 million per month at
00:00:06.839 the end of the first year Prestige Labs
00:00:08.960 got to $1.5 million per month by the end
00:00:11.200 of the first year and gym launch got to
00:00:13.120 over $2 million per month by the end of
00:00:15.080 the first year I'm going to show you the
00:00:17.000 strongest growth levers I used to get
00:00:19.199 these results so that you can too let's
00:00:21.680 start with the first one which is nobody
00:00:23.720 knows you exist and if you're under $1
00:00:26.519 million in Revenue I can virtually
00:00:28.439 guarantee that basically everyone on
00:00:30.000 Earth doesn't know you exist and so the
00:00:32.000 first four hours of every day should be
00:00:34.120 dedicated to solving that problem and
00:00:35.960 going from obscurity to being aware and
00:00:38.440 so we do that by doing the core for more
00:00:41.680 which is you have to do more Outreach
00:00:43.360 cold or warm you have to make more
00:00:45.200 content or you got to run ads but the
00:00:46.840 thing is is you don't need to do all of
00:00:48.199 them you pick one you go all in and
00:00:50.079 that's what you spend your first four
00:00:51.079 hours every single day on now the reason
00:00:52.920 that I talk about advertising more so
00:00:54.680 much is that advertising is a boom and
00:00:57.160 if you're like what's a boom it's
00:00:58.559 actually a term that I started using
00:00:59.640 inter for our business which is a
00:01:01.519 business order of magnitude change all
00:01:03.760 right and so fundamentally if you think
00:01:05.840 about a business there are many things
00:01:07.439 that you can optimize so you can
00:01:09.080 increase your close rate by 10% you can
00:01:10.759 increase your your conversion rate on
00:01:12.200 your on your optin page by 10% you can
00:01:13.960 increase your email followup all of
00:01:15.720 those things are optimizations and so
00:01:18.080 the problem is with optimizations you
00:01:20.040 can only go to 100% they're capped but
00:01:22.680 with advertising you can in a very real
00:01:25.159 way 100x the amount of people who find
00:01:28.079 out about your business and one of the
00:01:29.680 key that small business owners get stuck
00:01:31.439 in is they get in this little
00:01:32.799 optimization mouse trap where they're
00:01:34.720 like I need to move this oh I I I I I
00:01:36.799 was at 10.1 1:1 and now I need to be at
00:01:39.320 at 10.2 to1 it's like dude just get a
00:01:41.799 100 times the leads and your business
00:01:43.320 will grow so here's what most people
00:01:45.360 think when they think about their given
00:01:46.960 Marketplace so let's say you're a local
00:01:48.439 dry cleaner all right you see that
00:01:50.240 you're advertising on Facebook and so
00:01:52.040 you see you have the whole pie and so
00:01:53.560 you're happy so that's just you then you
00:01:56.719 have you plus one other person then all
00:01:59.280 of a sudden you've got half of the pie
00:02:01.159 then it's you plus three other people in
00:02:03.039 the marketplace and now you feel sad but
00:02:06.600 the reality is the marketplace is
00:02:08.560 significantly bigger than you ever give
00:02:09.919 it credit for there are so many humans
00:02:11.879 on Earth this is what it looks like in
00:02:13.480 reality you're actually only advertising
00:02:16.120 on one of four different methods and the
00:02:18.879 way that you're doing it is only on one
00:02:20.680 slice of the medium and then within that
00:02:22.760 you have your tiny little quarter that
00:02:24.720 you're taking up and so the marketplace
00:02:27.120 has so many different ways they can
00:02:28.840 communicate using each
00:02:30.360 of the methods of communication so for
00:02:32.599 example if I'm talking about content I'm
00:02:34.400 like oh there's somebody else in my
00:02:35.440 Marketplace who's marketing on Instagram
00:02:37.440 Okay cool so there's that but isn't
00:02:40.040 there also other platforms you can do it
00:02:41.640 on and don't you think that maybe
00:02:43.440 there's enough people in your
00:02:44.560 Marketplace to satisfy your business
00:02:46.480 probably the amount of times that I
00:02:47.879 would have a gym owner for example who'd
00:02:49.239 come to me and say hey there's this
00:02:50.720 other guy in the marketplace who's now
00:02:52.000 running Facebook ads I'm like you only
00:02:53.920 need 200 people in your gym to be
00:02:55.400 incredibly profitable and right now the
00:02:57.360 last time I checked you've got 1 million
00:02:59.080 people in your city and so you just have
00:03:00.920 to get 200 of them and so if there's 10
00:03:03.200 others or 100 other gyms that are
00:03:05.239 advertising your era even on the same
00:03:07.319 platform you still just need to get
00:03:10.959 0.002% of that audience to just come to
00:03:13.680 you and so you think that as these
00:03:15.720 people enter you're losing market share
00:03:18.200 but the reality is you're this tiny
00:03:19.760 little spec and most people don't even
00:03:21.840 know you exist so the next growth
00:03:23.840 principle is instead of trying to beat
00:03:27.200 your competition shrink your competition
00:03:29.920 Eminem has responded to hate in two ways
00:03:32.239 publicly that I absolutely love so the
00:03:34.400 first is that when will frell confronted
00:03:37.840 him about some things that Afrojack had
00:03:39.640 said to him he said hey afrojack's been
00:03:41.840 talking trash do you have anything to
00:03:43.040 say about it and Eminem just said who
00:03:45.840 and then will faroh repeated the
00:03:47.080 statement and then he just looked at him
00:03:48.200 and he was like who and he was like okay
00:03:50.360 yep that's what I thought and so the
00:03:52.239 first is I'm so big I can't hear him the
00:03:56.519 secondary is that you kill them with
00:03:58.560 kindness right so either grow so big
00:04:00.959 that no one can see them or hear them or
00:04:02.799 you meet them where they're at on a
00:04:04.439 different game which is you play on
00:04:06.159 kindness and Grace and so in 8 Mile
00:04:09.200 Eminem tries to claim all of the flaws
00:04:11.480 that he has so that no one else can say
00:04:13.480 anything and so I get hit on a lot not
00:04:16.519 like that uh for talking about working a
00:04:19.839 lot people are like that's not healthy
00:04:21.680 and of course I try to put disclaimers
00:04:23.160 in every video I'm like do whatever you
00:04:24.199 want right um I get uh hit on for like
00:04:27.479 oh I think he's he's trying to make
00:04:29.280 money duh I try to say it all the time
00:04:32.800 but people assume that I am trying to
00:04:34.520 hide this from my owns of course I'm
00:04:35.639 trying to make money I'm in business
00:04:36.759 that's the whole point I do this and
00:04:37.960 that way if I always start with I'm here
00:04:39.600 to make money when I do something nice
00:04:41.840 then people are like oh well that was
00:04:43.160 nice of him rather than me claiming that
00:04:44.560 I I have to be the Super kind whatever
00:04:46.120 person and then when I try and make
00:04:48.479 money people are like ah shake their
00:04:49.759 finger at me like it's not good and so I
00:04:52.360 try and learn from mem and just take all
00:04:55.280 of the negatives that I can think that
00:04:56.400 somebody would possibly say and then
00:04:57.479 just claim them as my own because yes we
00:04:59.919 are all flawed and none of us are
00:05:01.320 perfect and so for some reason we are
00:05:03.199 bothered when someone else points out
00:05:04.360 our imperfections that we would readily
00:05:06.000 State ourselves we know we have
00:05:07.360 deficiencies what you want to do is
00:05:09.080 overwhelm the marketplace so that you
00:05:11.400 drown them out you want to be so loud
00:05:13.680 that no one else can hear them you
00:05:15.160 shrink them into irrelevance by
00:05:17.199 comparison and so there's two ways that
00:05:19.680 you can become the tallest building
00:05:21.039 right you can knock everyone else down
00:05:23.240 or you grow so that they become smaller
00:05:25.400 in comparison to you and so everyone
00:05:27.440 sees their little building and thinks oh
00:05:29.919 no I should knock all my competitors
00:05:32.160 down right when in reality all you need
00:05:34.360 to do is build the biggest absolute
00:05:36.240 building there and the thing is is that
00:05:37.759 you're going to block out the Sun and
00:05:39.520 your Shadow will be so big that no one
00:05:41.360 can even see these people and let me
00:05:43.600 tell you a story about this when I
00:05:46.360 launched my last book 00 million leads I
00:05:49.960 spent a tremendous amount of time and
00:05:51.600 effort across I think at the time we had
00:05:53.680 sevenish million uh subscribers or you
00:05:56.319 know audience size across all platforms
00:05:58.240 I emailed a bunch I made a ton of com
00:05:59.639 content we spent money on ads we did
00:06:01.000 Outreach we had Affiliates going we had
00:06:03.160 all these different channels going to
00:06:04.800 get as many people as possible to the
00:06:06.400 launch and when I walk around Las Vegas
00:06:09.599 because I live here I will usually get
00:06:12.080 stopped about three-ish times when I do
00:06:15.080 about a 60-minute walk uh mind you I
00:06:17.599 walk in a crowded area so it's not like
00:06:19.160 I'm just like walking in the
00:06:20.000 neighborhood because then that would
00:06:20.919 just be weird anyways and of course you
00:06:22.000 should be recognized by your neighbors
00:06:23.319 but I'll get stopped by three people and
00:06:25.680 every time for the month leading up to
00:06:27.199 the launch I would be like hey you going
00:06:29.160 to the book launch 19 times out of 20
00:06:32.400 the people would look at me and be like
00:06:33.960 what's the book launch and I was like
00:06:35.840 how do you not know about this right but
00:06:37.759 it was this wonderful reminder that most
00:06:40.000 people when you get tired of your
00:06:41.800 advertising most people don't even know
00:06:43.960 your first name if you have diluted
00:06:46.800 yourself into thinking that you should
00:06:49.800 only have to say something once and
00:06:51.360 somehow everyone in the entire world has
00:06:53.039 heard you say that thing you are kidding
00:06:55.560 yourself you need to become a master of
00:06:58.520 variety in terms of of how you can resay
00:07:00.680 the same thing in different ways and
00:07:02.759 taking the natural extreme there's this
00:07:05.039 fallacy that most small business owners
00:07:07.000 think and myself- included for years I
00:07:09.039 thought this was that repetition in and
00:07:12.080 of itself is somehow bad so let me
00:07:14.240 explain there's probably people on the
00:07:16.800 internet I personally follow a bunch of
00:07:19.000 philosophy accounts and so most of the
00:07:21.680 philosophers are dead and yet I still
00:07:25.960 love to see the quotes they have because
00:07:27.919 they remind me of the things that I want
00:07:30.720 to follow the way that I want to live
00:07:33.720 and it's not like oh another senica
00:07:35.840 quote does this guy never give up it's
00:07:37.759 like he's dead he hasn't come up with a
00:07:39.680 new quote in 2,000 years and yet I still
00:07:42.919 like seeing the quotes even though I
00:07:44.680 know I've seen them before and often
00:07:46.599 times you serve that role for your
00:07:48.639 audience more than anything else like we
00:07:50.960 think that it's like oh I've said this
00:07:52.440 one thing therefore they have all
00:07:53.599 changed out their behavior immediately
00:07:54.960 and they never need to learn that again
00:07:56.479 but the biggest lesson that I've learned
00:07:58.000 is that people need to be more reminded
00:07:59.560 then they need to be taught and in the
00:08:01.400 off chance that you've received hate or
00:08:03.360 you have a competitor who's talking crap
00:08:05.120 and it
00:08:06.199 happens this counts double so instead of
00:08:09.400 trying to beat them or prove them wrong
00:08:11.479 you only have two options option one is
00:08:14.120 you grow so big that no one can even
00:08:16.440 hear them the alternative is that you
00:08:19.199 kill them with kindness which is that
00:08:21.039 you do not beat them by proving that you
00:08:24.919 are right you beat them by proving that
00:08:29.840 you are
00:08:31.440 kind and then by comparison they will
00:08:34.679 look bad and so I can only thing I can
00:08:37.880 tell you about having dealt with plenty
00:08:39.120 of it in my day is that on the occasion
00:08:41.240 that I do choose to respond to hate I
00:08:43.240 try to respond with kindness and so
00:08:45.279 someone can just absolutely tear me one
00:08:47.040 and just say like this guy sucks he's
00:08:48.519 terrible whatever right I will then
00:08:50.959 usually say hey you're right I'm a super
00:08:53.800 flawed person um that being said it
00:08:55.959 seems like you've developed like a big
00:08:57.279 audience here and they seem to like you
00:08:58.720 and so congrats on your your success
00:09:00.480 right when someone sees that it's very
00:09:02.800 hard for everyone to be like man that
00:09:04.800 guy sucks it's just like now if I were
00:09:06.800 to try and like list out all the points
00:09:08.480 all I do is invite more back and forth
00:09:10.560 which I don't want to do and it's a
00:09:11.720 waste of my time and so instead you
00:09:14.560 start all hate responses with you are
00:09:16.720 right because it's all they want to hear
00:09:18.279 and there's really nothing else to say
00:09:19.600 after that and so what's interesting is
00:09:21.360 that often times hate if you boil it
00:09:23.240 down comes down to I do not prefer the
00:09:26.839 way this person does things I have a
00:09:29.120 different preference and it's like great
00:09:32.160 right like I I make money one way he
00:09:34.640 makes money another way and therefore he
00:09:36.560 is wrong it's like no you just do the
00:09:38.519 way you want which is awesome because
00:09:39.839 you do it your way and they do it their
00:09:41.279 way and the people who are attract to
00:09:42.320 that will do that and the people attract
00:09:43.279 to you will do yours and great like I
00:09:45.200 mean of course there's engagement
00:09:46.320 baiting and things like that because you
00:09:47.560 know people people want to get views and
00:09:48.839 all that and I and I respect it I get it
00:09:50.800 um but but big picture I think you can't
00:09:53.760 take it um you can't take it personally
00:09:56.560 because whenever I I fall into that
00:09:58.120 little trap I think to myself
00:09:59.920 I'm a relatively developed monkey that
00:10:01.680 is sitting on a little Blue Marble in a
00:10:04.160 solar system that's in one of a billion
00:10:06.160 galaxies and I'm worried about some
00:10:08.200 screen that has words on it of a madeup
00:10:10.240 language that we had in the last 1500
00:10:11.720 years of how we communicate face noise
00:10:13.560 to each other and when I think about
00:10:14.880 that I think you know this would be
00:10:15.920 pretty silly for me to like ruin a day
00:10:17.399 over so the third big growth lever and
00:10:19.360 this one's massive is clear not clever
00:10:23.000 all right so what do I mean by that well
00:10:24.760 when I looked at the highest converting
00:10:26.920 ads that I had run and I do this pretty
00:10:29.000 regular
00:10:29.920 I look for different components
00:10:32.000 sometimes I'm like What's the hook
00:10:33.160 sometimes I'm like what's the color
00:10:34.120 scheme what's the what's the visuals
00:10:36.200 that are being displayed in the first
00:10:37.360 however many seconds and in this one
00:10:39.920 particular pass I just looked at the
00:10:41.560 grade level of the language that was
00:10:43.240 being spoken and the reason I looked at
00:10:45.120 that it was I think it was a you know
00:10:46.519 one or two election Cycles ago I had
00:10:48.399 heard this research study that had
00:10:49.600 stated that the president who spoke in
00:10:51.480 the lowest grade language was the one
00:10:54.000 that won the election over and over
00:10:55.639 again and when I heard that I see
00:10:57.639 presidential elections fundamentally as
00:10:59.480 massive brand campaigns and so I see
00:11:02.839 that as they were able to communicate a
00:11:05.720 message to a higher percentage of the
00:11:07.200 population because they lowered the
00:11:08.600 barrier to entry of comprehension
00:11:10.360 meaning more people got what they said
00:11:13.399 and so when I hear that I thought man I
00:11:16.240 like to use all these big fancy College
00:11:18.200 words and no one knows what I'm saying
00:11:20.519 and so all I do is feed my ego not my
00:11:22.680 bank account and so I made one of my big
00:11:25.279 marking rules clear not clever and so
00:11:28.720 you want to take whatever communication
00:11:30.839 is look at your landing pages look at
00:11:32.360 your ad copy look at the words you're
00:11:33.880 saying in your content and say does a
00:11:36.360 third grader understand this and the
00:11:38.279 point that some people try to make as a
00:11:39.839 counter is like oh I don't want to talk
00:11:41.399 down to my audience no when you speak in
00:11:43.920 a more broken down manner you help the
00:11:46.480 experts understand it more easily and
00:11:48.959 you help the beginners understand it for
00:11:50.720 the first time and so it's not that
00:11:52.560 experts are all of a sudden saying oh no
00:11:54.399 I I don't believe that because listen we
00:11:55.760 get tons of very big companies that come
00:11:57.160 to acquisition. comom for investment and
00:11:59.079 the the guys who run those companies
00:12:00.560 very intelligent but I try to make my
00:12:03.200 videos in a way that people can't
00:12:05.000 understand them because who who do I who
00:12:07.360 do I prove when I use a big word and
00:12:10.040 then all of a sudden 3ars of the
00:12:11.639 audience can't understand it and if the
00:12:13.440 point of me making these videos is to
00:12:15.279 make real business education accessible
00:12:16.720 for everyone part of it making it
00:12:18.360 accessible is making it interesting
00:12:20.040 making it fun and making it
00:12:21.399 comprehensible which is a fancy word for
00:12:23.519 understandable and what you guys don't
00:12:25.199 see behind the scenes is that I will
00:12:27.920 typically selfed and so I said distilled
00:12:31.120 earlier in a sentence than I said broken
00:12:33.480 down for experts it because I said
00:12:34.920 distilled and I was like I have to use a
00:12:36.199 different word broken down and then I
00:12:37.839 said comprehensible and then I said
00:12:39.279 fancy word for understandable and so I
00:12:41.720 try to constantly catch myself in this
00:12:43.920 and it's also made me a significantly
00:12:45.680 more effective leader so if I'm trying
00:12:47.680 to communicate with my team I'm not
00:12:49.240 trying to say big words I don't want to
00:12:51.040 impress them I want to change what they
00:12:52.519 do and so I I've taken this to such an
00:12:54.680 extreme that with my books I just use
00:12:56.639 little little stick figures right I have
00:12:58.519 these little drawing it's like oh look
00:13:00.000 here's a guy who's walking on a path
00:13:01.399 look little apple orange big dollar sign
00:13:03.720 little dollar sign right we try to make
00:13:05.480 this as simple as possible so that
00:13:07.040 people can understand what's actually
00:13:08.440 going on because if you can explain it
00:13:10.320 to a third grader and this is Richard
00:13:11.560 fan who said this who famous physicist
00:13:13.480 he said if you can explain it to a third
00:13:14.920 grader then you understand it if you
00:13:16.440 can't you don't and you need to
00:13:17.839 understand it better so that you can
00:13:18.880 break it down and so the broader the
00:13:20.800 audience the broader the analogy and the
00:13:22.800 simpler the language and so I'll give
00:13:24.839 you an example one element is the grade
00:13:26.839 language of the words you use the second
00:13:29.320 is what visuals or stories you use to
00:13:31.440 depict them and so if I'm talking to
00:13:33.920 mechanics I might use an analogy where I
00:13:36.279 relate something they understand cars to
00:13:38.079 something they might not understand a
00:13:39.320 business right if I wanted to teach a
00:13:40.959 specific concept if I was talking to the
00:13:43.680 same uh I was trying to teach the same
00:13:45.320 concept but I was teaching it to
00:13:46.720 Realtors then I would probably use a
00:13:48.519 house analogy if I was teaching it to
00:13:50.240 baseball people I would probably use a
00:13:51.720 baseball analogy right and so if you
00:13:54.240 have a narrow down audience you'll
00:13:55.720 increase comprehension by using
00:13:57.160 analogies that they all understand if
00:13:58.720 you're talking to a broader audience
00:14:00.360 then you need to have a broader slice of
00:14:03.120 the market probably a more human
00:14:05.360 experience that all of them have so if
00:14:07.360 I'm talking to everyone I might talk
00:14:08.839 about food I might talk about sleep I
00:14:11.360 might talk about driving right because
00:14:13.440 most people do that assuming I'm not
00:14:14.800 talking to children and so you have to
00:14:17.480 match the analogy to the history of
00:14:21.959 learning from the people that you're
00:14:24.199 trying to communicate to and this is
00:14:27.000 what takes your marketing and your
00:14:28.519 advertising and puts it on steroids and
00:14:30.920 to put this to the test this is
00:14:32.720 something you can do right now look at
00:14:35.000 whatever emails you send run them
00:14:37.199 through a reading grading level
00:14:39.199 app keep working on it until it's below
00:14:41.680 fifth grade minimum third grade if
00:14:43.279 you're awesome and then send it I did
00:14:46.040 this to our email follow-ups and had a
00:14:48.480 50% increase in conversion I didn't
00:14:51.120 change anything about what I said but I
00:14:53.360 saw that as I got 50% more people to
00:14:56.199 understand because the goal here is to
00:14:58.600 decreas increase the friction of
00:15:00.240 comprehension so if we think about the
00:15:01.959 elements of value speed ease time delay
00:15:05.519 these elements are all impacted by
00:15:07.560 complexity and so something complex
00:15:09.360 takes longer to understand it takes more
00:15:11.160 effort right and so and it's harder
00:15:13.880 right and so instead what we want to do
00:15:15.360 is say okay how do I make it easy and
00:15:17.120 faster okay well then I'll just speak in
00:15:21.000 a way that everyone understands the next
00:15:23.160 massive growth lever is proof over
00:15:26.600 promise all right and so with this means
00:15:29.600 is that in my earlier days I would spend
00:15:31.920 so much time on my promise right and I
00:15:35.240 wrote a whole book on promises which is
00:15:36.720 basically offers right and I would
00:15:38.360 obsess about the offer but and the offer
00:15:40.800 is super important but the only thing
00:15:43.000 that's more important is proof all right
00:15:45.199 so let me give you two hypothetical
00:15:46.519 examples let's say that you've got
00:15:48.360 business one that's selling Thing One
00:15:50.199 and business two that's selling thing
00:15:51.600 two well let's say they still compete
00:15:54.279 for more or less the same audience and
00:15:56.319 business 2 says we'll do X we'll do y
00:15:58.360 we'll do Z we'll do W and we'll
00:16:00.040 guarantee X Y and Z right and you look
00:16:02.560 at their reviews and they've got a
00:16:04.240 five-star rating and they've got one
00:16:06.440 review the other company says we'll do X
00:16:10.360 and they've got
00:16:11.560 11382 five stars and they've got a
00:16:14.040 4.7 who do you buy from this guy
00:16:18.199 obviously but why this guy has a better
00:16:21.000 promise because you believe this guy and
00:16:23.759 so you want to have proof up to your
00:16:25.959 eyeballs proof is your single highest
00:16:29.040 EST priority as a business owner or
00:16:31.319 marketer or Advertiser or promoter for
00:16:33.319 your business it is the one thing that
00:16:35.199 you prioritize before I enter any new
00:16:37.160 space launch a new product the first
00:16:39.120 thing that I do is try and get beta
00:16:40.440 users I work for free in exchange for
00:16:43.199 testimonials reviews and feedback and
00:16:45.680 sometimes referrals if I'm lucky but in
00:16:47.800 the beginning that is the highest most
00:16:50.720 valuable thing that you can do so people
00:16:53.279 will say things like never work for free
00:16:55.160 and you only hear that from people who
00:16:56.920 don't make that much money if you make a
00:16:59.480 lot of money you will know that you
00:17:01.160 spend so much time in the free phas
00:17:03.000 because getting the product right is so
00:17:05.199 important is such high leverage and so
00:17:07.760 the proof process both makes you
00:17:10.839 convicted because you get the
00:17:13.000 opportunity of many feedback loops to
00:17:14.799 make your product better so that you
00:17:17.880 then can collect the positive feedback
00:17:19.640 that you can then advertise to get more
00:17:21.199 people like those
00:17:22.520 customers and the most compelling way to
00:17:26.400 advertise anything is show don't sell
00:17:30.120 and if I just stand here and said
00:17:31.840 nothing and I said and I just stated the
00:17:33.840 facts and told the truth and I said I
00:17:36.559 have
00:17:39.120 11382 reviews and our average review is
00:17:42.760 4.7 and I make pasta really
00:17:47.080 good and then or I have one review from
00:17:52.000 my mama and I make super fragile
00:17:55.240 calistic X docious pasta guaranteed
00:17:58.679 which which one do you like better
00:18:00.720 obviously this one you don't need to say
00:18:03.120 much more the proof is the pudding the
00:18:06.000 most important part of a message is the
00:18:08.840 messenger themselves they're
00:18:10.400 inextricably linked from the thing
00:18:12.039 that's being communicated and this is
00:18:13.600 what people seem to miss when they're
00:18:15.000 making content which is why I'm a big
00:18:17.360 advocate of do epic stuff first then
00:18:20.679 talk about what you did and if the stuff
00:18:22.520 that you didn't do is epic focus more on
00:18:24.520 the doing epic stuff not on the talking
00:18:26.559 about it and so I started this channel
00:18:29.679 uh with a commitment to a vendor saying
00:18:31.720 I'll make three YouTube videos a week
00:18:33.200 and I was busy and I was like I'm just
00:18:34.720 going to hit a webcam and I'm going to
00:18:35.799 talk to the camera and that is how this
00:18:37.640 channel was started and the only reason
00:18:40.880 in my opinion that people decided to
00:18:43.480 listen was because I just so happened to
00:18:45.360 have sold a company for just under $50
00:18:47.080 million and so because of that there was
00:18:50.400 proof that I was able to deliver on the
00:18:53.080 promise whereas somebody else might have
00:18:55.280 a totally beautiful studio and have all
00:18:57.360 these things but they just forgot the
00:18:59.320 one most important thing which is why
00:19:00.840 should I listen to you and so it either
00:19:03.640 is going to have to be proof that you
00:19:04.880 generated for yourself or proof from
00:19:06.919 other people saying that you help them
00:19:08.360 achieve that thing if any of these
00:19:10.080 growth principles help you in thinking
00:19:12.720 about your business differently so that
00:19:14.120 you can scale faster or you need to
00:19:15.720 sendage your team it would mean the
00:19:17.000 world to me if you shared it um that's
00:19:19.120 my only ask and appreciate it so the
00:19:21.880 next big thing is the hook now you're
00:19:24.520 like okay I've heard about hooks before
00:19:26.440 not the way that I'm going to talk about
00:19:27.520 it all right so so the hook is greater
00:19:30.440 than everything now you're like wait a
00:19:32.400 second I thought proof was greater than
00:19:33.480 everything well the proof is going to be
00:19:34.600 contained in the thing but no one's
00:19:35.919 going to see the proof unless you have a
00:19:36.960 good hook all right and so the one thing
00:19:39.440 that I think has consistently been
00:19:41.039 reinforced and it's just like a greater
00:19:42.840 and greater percentage of my time is
00:19:44.679 allocated towards this one part of my
00:19:46.280 advertising that grows my company the
00:19:47.880 most is I search for the best Hooks and
00:19:52.039 then I don't convince myself that I'm
00:19:53.679 more creative than I think I am and I
00:19:55.400 just keep using the ones that work so
00:19:57.280 think about it like this these are the
00:19:58.880 only four things that you can do to
00:20:00.240 advertise any business you can warm
00:20:01.679 Outreach so reaching out 10 one to
00:20:03.039 people you know cold Outreach reaching
00:20:05.000 one one to people you don't know you can
00:20:06.520 run paid ads which is going one to many
00:20:08.120 to people you don't know or you can post
00:20:09.480 content which is one to many to people
00:20:10.840 you do know and in each of these four
00:20:13.720 situations you can double triple 5x the
00:20:17.880 amount of people who open and respond
00:20:20.440 who click and watch your ad who uh watch
00:20:23.360 your content all the way to the end and
00:20:25.400 if you do something like that and you do
00:20:26.880 increase the clickr rate by go from 1% %
00:20:28.840 to 5% or 2% to 10% which absolutely can
00:20:31.880 happen when you do
00:20:34.280 that you in a very real way can 2x 3x 4X
00:20:38.640 5x your business with just that one
00:20:41.320 thing remember I talked about earlier
00:20:42.880 that advertising is a boom it's it's an
00:20:45.120 order of magnitude change well what
00:20:48.000 other one thing can you just tweak that
00:20:52.000 then opens up the flow to the entire
00:20:54.600 business based on how good the first
00:20:56.799 five seconds are or the first one second
00:20:59.799 and so in thinking about hooks I think
00:21:01.679 about both the visual hook as in what's
00:21:04.200 happening what that people can see and
00:21:05.960 then there's the auditory or or verbal
00:21:07.799 hook which is what are the actual words
00:21:09.039 that are being communicated and we have
00:21:12.600 right now we reviewed our top YouTube
00:21:14.159 videos of all time and I made a video
00:21:16.039 about six months ago saying what we
00:21:17.240 found which is our hook formula is proof
00:21:22.080 promise plan and so if you have the
00:21:25.520 opportunity to make content make make
00:21:28.799 ads run cold outbound if you can include
00:21:31.679 these I can almost guarantee that you
00:21:33.919 will do better than if you include none
00:21:35.320 of them and this is a force multiplier
00:21:37.480 on any kind of advertising you do and so
00:21:39.799 when I think about like all the
00:21:41.000 different things all the effort that
00:21:42.360 goes into advertising a business if I
00:21:44.559 can just do one thing and the crazy part
00:21:46.440 about hooks is they're the shortest part
00:21:48.640 they're the shortest part of the whole
00:21:50.039 darn thing and this is where David Ogie
00:21:53.000 says if you have written your headline
00:21:55.080 you've spent 80 cents of your
00:21:56.200 advertising dollar the more advanced the
00:21:58.159 advertis is that I meet whether it's a
00:22:00.080 content creator somebody who's on
00:22:01.440 outbound somebody who makes paid ads the
00:22:03.400 more obsessive they are on the first
00:22:06.679 frame the first impression that someone
00:22:09.080 gets because they know one it increases
00:22:11.320 the likel that the person's going to
00:22:12.320 watch the rest of it and then
00:22:13.120 potentially buy and then two it changes
00:22:15.919 their entire perception of what follows
00:22:18.559 so we actually looked at this uh for
00:22:20.600 speakers at an event which was if we
00:22:23.880 change the intro the the one to two
00:22:26.559 minute intro that we had for a 60-minute
00:22:28.320 talk talk the person's net promoter
00:22:31.039 score so what people rated them in terms
00:22:32.600 of how good they were changed massively
00:22:36.000 even though the actual presentation was
00:22:38.200 the same so simply how we framed the
00:22:40.799 presenter the person that even gotten up
00:22:42.039 on stage yet changed how everything they
00:22:44.960 did afterwards was perceived and so if
00:22:47.679 there's two minutes that can influence
00:22:49.840 the score that you get the customer
00:22:51.400 satisfaction the amount of prospects the
00:22:53.640 one thing to focus on is nail the hook
00:22:55.919 let me show you the force multiplication
00:22:57.480 of this we just started reviewing uh
00:23:00.039 short form content on the content team
00:23:01.919 and just doing a more regular activity
00:23:03.640 of saying like what are the things that
00:23:04.760 make uh content do well and there was a
00:23:07.159 video that we were like we think this
00:23:08.400 thing is good and so all we did is we
00:23:11.080 took the same video that got like 40,000
00:23:13.200 views and then we just chopped out the
00:23:15.840 first three seconds that was kind of
00:23:17.240 like getting into the into the video
00:23:19.440 before the actual real Hook was
00:23:20.640 delivered and by snipping those three
00:23:22.640 seconds and then just starting where the
00:23:23.960 hook really was it went from a 40,000
00:23:26.200 view video to a 780,000
00:23:28.720 video so you're talking about a 19x
00:23:31.200 Improvement so I'm talking about you
00:23:32.640 know 1% 2% I'm talking
00:23:35.240 19x that is why obsessing over the Hoke
00:23:38.120 is so important so the next big growth
00:23:40.400 lever that gave us the super fast growth
00:23:43.440 was more so I talk about more
00:23:46.919 better and new as the three primary
00:23:50.679 strategies of growth you either do more
00:23:52.320 of what's already working you do what
00:23:53.960 you're doing to make it work better or
00:23:56.279 you do something entirely new now most
00:23:58.440 entrepreneurs love doing new stuff and
00:24:00.039 that's why it's called shiny object
00:24:01.200 syndrome and it's a Cancer and you
00:24:02.559 should get that looked at but the very
00:24:05.000 boring answer is the mundane more you
00:24:08.159 have to master more and it's going
00:24:11.360 instead of zero to one which is what
00:24:13.320 most people love doing oh my God I
00:24:14.840 finally got it to work but actually
00:24:16.200 doing one to end which is how do I do as
00:24:18.600 this thing as many times as seemly
00:24:20.120 possible without wanting to kill myself
00:24:22.240 and so here's the actual math
00:24:24.440 explanation of this more is typically
00:24:26.679 the highest risk adjusted turn strategy
00:24:29.640 all right and so what that means is if
00:24:33.039 you can do something and you already
00:24:35.480 know it works the likelihood that the
00:24:37.640 next thing you do works is much smaller
00:24:40.399 and so this is why once you have a
00:24:42.000 control meaning you have um a specific
00:24:45.159 landing page or ad or copy or email that
00:24:48.039 you know converts whenever you deviate
00:24:50.960 from a high converting advertisement the
00:24:53.840 likelihood that the variant is going to
00:24:55.880 beat it is typically low and so you have
00:24:58.399 to try a bunch of variations cuz all
00:25:00.039 you're doing is messing something up
00:25:01.320 that actually already works if you had
00:25:04.240 one sales guy and he's closing at
00:25:07.520 30% well you could try and obsess to get
00:25:10.600 him to 35 or 40% and that would be
00:25:13.039 material you know get a 25% lift overall
00:25:15.399 30 to 40% to 25% Improvement but you
00:25:18.240 know what would be even cooler just hire
00:25:20.520 three more guys and then you have a 4X
00:25:23.799 or a 300% Improvement and so it's like I
00:25:26.799 could get a 25% Improvement or I could
00:25:28.480 get a 300% Improvement and me trying to
00:25:30.919 change up the sales script also has a
00:25:32.360 significant shot of me taking it from 30
00:25:34.720 down to 20 because it's a change and so
00:25:37.399 here's the thing is that when you change
00:25:39.200 anything you guarantee you incur the
00:25:41.960 cost of change but you do not guarantee
00:25:44.279 that you get the benefit of change and
00:25:46.640 so in each of the core four methods you
00:25:49.240 do more Outreach which is cold or warm
00:25:51.120 you go from 100 reach outs a day to 200
00:25:52.760 reach outs a day paid ads you go from
00:25:54.120 $100 a day to $200 a day you go from
00:25:55.720 posting content you go from posting once
00:25:56.840 a day to twice a day right those are how
00:25:59.919 you do more and when I talk to the most
00:26:03.000 experienced advertisers that I know the
00:26:04.520 most experienced business people that I
00:26:06.200 know the most common theme we talk about
00:26:08.559 is we kind of laugh in the back room of
00:26:10.039 like if people just people just don't
00:26:11.679 know how much more they can do that's
00:26:14.080 that's honestly the real that's the real
00:26:16.960 is that when I when I when I have
00:26:18.520 conversations with small business owners
00:26:19.679 they're like hey I don't think I can do
00:26:21.039 any more uh ads you know I'm running I'm
00:26:23.720 I'm already running $1,000 a day I'm
00:26:25.240 like I mean dude there's businesses that
00:26:26.960 run like two million a day and so you
00:26:30.159 usually have so much more Runway than
00:26:31.919 you think you do and sometimes you just
00:26:34.360 need someone ahead of you to be like
00:26:35.559 dude you can like 10x this and nothing's
00:26:37.159 going to change but they think because
00:26:39.120 of whatever mental limitation they have
00:26:40.480 are like you've never spent that much
00:26:42.159 money on on an ad before you've never
00:26:43.640 made that am is it goingon to hurt my
00:26:45.799 account no they want you to make good
00:26:47.600 content is it going to hurt my ads no
00:26:49.120 they want you to spend money is it gonna
00:26:51.080 is it going to hurt my my you're going
00:26:52.600 to people who've never met you before so
00:26:54.080 why would they know that you've sent it
00:26:55.159 to another 100 people right is that
00:26:57.159 there's this these perceived fears but
00:26:59.880 most of the times it's just between your
00:27:01.360 ears I'll tell you guys a quick story
00:27:02.799 about this so when I had my first I
00:27:05.440 would say real business uh which is my
00:27:07.320 first location of my first gym I had a
00:27:09.760 mentor and he was a really good local
00:27:11.600 marketer and so he had a strategy for
00:27:14.399 his tning salons where he would bring in
00:27:16.600 I mean thousands of customers every
00:27:18.279 single uh every single quarter and what
00:27:21.039 he did was he would put out flyers he
00:27:22.840 just put flyers on cars and then had
00:27:24.320 like a you know free VIP gift card and
00:27:25.919 people would come in redeem them you
00:27:26.960 flip them into memberships and so I
00:27:29.080 figured okay I'll just run the same play
00:27:31.440 and so I did the Flyers and I put 300
00:27:35.080 Flyers out and I waited by the phone
00:27:37.559 being like Oh my God I'm going get 300
00:27:38.880 people in here it's going to be sick and
00:27:41.559 what happened well my phone only rang
00:27:43.600 once from the Flyers and when I picked
00:27:45.840 up the phone uh the guy was like hey did
00:27:48.080 you put the flyer on my car and I was
00:27:49.679 like yeah I did I like what time you but
00:27:52.080 he cut me off and he was like you
00:27:53.399 damaged my Mercedes and I was like click
00:27:56.279 and I I didn't know what to do um and as
00:27:59.799 soon as i i i i and thankfully he never
00:28:01.840 called me back because I definitely had
00:28:02.799 didn't have the money to fix any
00:28:03.799 Mercedes at that time um I called uh uh
00:28:07.799 my mentor back up you know a week or two
00:28:09.679 later once it was clear that no one else
00:28:11.039 was going to call I said he said hey
00:28:13.159 how' the Flyers work out and I was like
00:28:14.640 well they didn't work out at all
00:28:16.120 actually you know I was like taking some
00:28:17.760 attitude with him he was like oh what
00:28:19.440 was your test size and he like he didn't
00:28:21.120 take the bait he was like oh what was
00:28:22.000 your test size and uh I said well what
00:28:25.000 do you mean he was like well like what'
00:28:26.720 you test with before you like did the
00:28:28.360 real campaign and I was like oh well I I
00:28:31.000 mean I put 300 out and he was like 300
00:28:34.799 he's like you can't know anything with
00:28:36.720 300 I was like what do you mean he's
00:28:38.440 like I test with 5,000 he's like and
00:28:40.840 then we put out uh 5,000 a day for 30
00:28:45.159 days and so I was looking at his results
00:28:49.760 from 150,000 Flyers over 30 days and
00:28:54.200 comparing them to my results of 300 in a
00:28:59.399 day and once I saw that ju to position I
00:29:02.559 was like got it I will never make this
00:29:05.600 mistake again it was very embarrassing
00:29:07.519 for me because I was on the right path I
00:29:10.720 just didn't do enough and so one of the
00:29:12.640 big metal lessons of this is that what
00:29:15.480 presents as volatility is typically a
00:29:18.760 symptom of low volume so if you're like
00:29:21.760 man I only get like you know a sale
00:29:23.279 every week or every other week it's kind
00:29:24.720 of like you know it's you know most days
00:29:26.399 I don't get a sale and then every once
00:29:27.360 in a while I get one
00:29:28.640 it only appears volatile because you're
00:29:31.480 doing so little per day but if I looked
00:29:34.080 at your year and saw that you closed
00:29:36.480 about let's say 12 customers in that
00:29:38.600 year you closed one a month for example
00:29:40.399 every every three or four weeks you get
00:29:42.279 a customer well all I would do is look
00:29:44.640 at your entire advertising activity for
00:29:46.600 the year and say okay if we wanted to
00:29:48.960 get 12 customers a day we would have to
00:29:50.960 do 365 times more advertising than we
00:29:54.039 currently do and if we did that on a
00:29:55.760 daily basis we would get 12 customers a
00:29:57.519 day and so you just take your to
00:29:59.279 calendar horizontally and then you flip
00:30:01.159 it vertically for a day and that is how
00:30:03.640 much volume is required and so most
00:30:05.519 people just think that it's like oh
00:30:06.720 they're they can't be doing more than
00:30:08.120 like twice as much as me but in my
00:30:10.279 experience the people who are crushing
00:30:11.840 it literally are doing a thousand times
00:30:13.840 more than you and that's the part that
00:30:15.519 like until you sometimes you hear it or
00:30:17.200 you have someone ahead of you say it it
00:30:18.760 doesn't become real for you and it's why
00:30:20.440 I make these videos is to try and like
00:30:21.840 push as much you know out of out of my
00:30:23.760 brain and and history so that you can
00:30:25.559 just get the story without the scar um
00:30:28.039 and that's and that's that's the whole
00:30:29.279 point okay so once you're like okay I
00:30:32.159 have something that's working I should
00:30:33.440 just do way more of that awesome well
00:30:35.600 the next thing the next power lever here
00:30:37.799 is word of mouth and it's not the way
00:30:40.159 that you think so Word of Mouth people
00:30:42.519 are familiar with referrals you know
00:30:44.120 customers uh tell other customers or
00:30:46.720 other prospects that your stuff is good
00:30:48.799 but what a lot of people don't
00:30:50.360 understand is that negative word of
00:30:52.039 mouth is significantly stronger and
00:30:54.440 faster than positive and so Disney did
00:30:58.080 this big study where they found that it
00:30:59.919 takes 37 tragic moments to make up for
00:31:01.679 one magic moment and versus uh there's
00:31:05.240 basically like a 5x versus 37x on uh if
00:31:09.039 someone has a good experience they tell
00:31:10.240 five people if someone has a bad
00:31:11.440 experience they tell like everybody and
00:31:14.440 so a new business owner often will get
00:31:17.360 customers pretty cheaply and then all of
00:31:20.000 a sudden costs start going up and part
00:31:21.799 of the reason that costs go up faster
00:31:23.679 because you can actually put math to
00:31:24.840 this which is understanding the
00:31:26.360 difference between CPM which is cost per
00:31:28.440 impression um and it's like why is it m
00:31:30.720 it's mil which is French for thousand so
00:31:32.519 it cost for thousand Impressions um
00:31:34.799 versus CPL which is cost per lead all
00:31:37.600 right and so if your cpms more or less
00:31:41.240 stay the same but your cost per lead has
00:31:43.519 2x or 3x or 4X well if it's not costing
00:31:48.080 you more to reach those people then it
00:31:49.799 means that fewer of them are responding
00:31:52.279 and if that's the case and you're just
00:31:54.080 going to still relatively warm markets
00:31:56.880 then the issue is that instead of having
00:32:00.360 positive word of mouth working for you
00:32:02.519 we should be actively lowering the
00:32:04.480 amount of cost that it takes to get a
00:32:06.840 new customer you have Word of Mouth
00:32:09.600 working against you and so people who
00:32:11.639 would otherwise purchase from you heard
00:32:14.039 something negative and then choose not
00:32:15.919 to and so now all of a sudden you have
00:32:17.720 to reach three times the amount of
00:32:18.919 people because two out of the three
00:32:20.159 people who would have gone and bought
00:32:22.240 your thing heard it was bad and then now
00:32:25.080 you only have one person who's just
00:32:26.360 heard nothing and so over time the
00:32:28.760 percentage of the audience that's
00:32:29.960 neutral or hasn't heard of you gets
00:32:31.760 smaller and smaller and smaller and so
00:32:34.039 it's way harder to grow off a word of
00:32:35.559 mouth that's positive but it's really
00:32:37.320 easy to get crushed on negative word of
00:32:39.039 mouth and for whatever reason no
00:32:41.080 business owner ever claims that they
00:32:43.440 have negative word of mouth but I can
00:32:45.159 tell you half of you are below average
00:32:48.320 that's a fact and this is why I
00:32:50.559 emphasize the proof over promise earlier
00:32:53.360 on so much because if I'm going to get
00:32:56.080 negative word of the mouth which I know
00:32:57.559 I am if I'm starting out I want to keep
00:32:59.440 that as concentrated and quiet as
00:33:01.159 possible I don't want anybody to know
00:33:02.960 right and so of course I'm not going to
00:33:04.360 charge the money because the last thing
00:33:05.919 I want to do is also have their money
00:33:07.200 when they're upset right so it's like
00:33:09.080 hey I'm making this trade you're going
00:33:10.679 to get stuff it's probably going not be
00:33:12.279 that good my only ask is you give me
00:33:13.840 feedback right tell me how I can make
00:33:15.679 this right tell me how I can make it
00:33:17.039 better right and when you ask those
00:33:18.600 types of questions you get the types of
00:33:19.880 answers that can ultimately create more
00:33:21.159 value for the customer and then once you
00:33:22.919 get positive feedback positive feedback
00:33:24.639 positive feedback now you have something
00:33:26.440 that people actually want they you can
00:33:28.039 need introduce strangers to it and of
00:33:29.639 course you're going to roll into the
00:33:30.559 next issue which is okay how do I keep
00:33:32.120 that consistent because now it's not me
00:33:33.399 doing everything I've got a team and
00:33:34.880 we'll get into that ah this is a really
00:33:36.399 good one so the next big growth lever is
00:33:39.320 steel uh oh what am I what am I about to
00:33:41.639 say
00:33:43.440 from yourself so one of our portfolio
00:33:46.360 companies which is very large hired a
00:33:48.200 new advertising director and that
00:33:50.639 advertising director had came in with
00:33:52.120 lots of new ideas and so the founder
00:33:54.279 because he wanted to teach an important
00:33:55.760 lesson to the advertising director said
00:33:57.360 sure let's let's do all of your ideas
00:33:58.720 and so he sat there he said the scripts
00:34:00.480 he you know he he recorded all these ads
00:34:02.399 he took multiple days to do it and what
00:34:04.919 ended up happening is that they ran all
00:34:06.880 the ads and they didn't work and so he
00:34:09.599 said hey crazy idea what if we use the
00:34:12.760 same hook that's been working for three
00:34:14.520 years and they used the same Hook and
00:34:17.079 the ads worked and so think about it
00:34:19.918 like this Nike on its second year after
00:34:23.639 just do it wasn't like hey just do it
00:34:25.719 kind of old let's switch it up it's it's
00:34:27.879 like when you find a message that
00:34:29.440 converts you keep hammering the message
00:34:31.879 when you find the ad Hooks and you find
00:34:34.879 the the the processes that work well for
00:34:38.440 you most times you'd be better served
00:34:42.239 just continuing to reuse it because you
00:34:43.960 will get bored of it far before your
00:34:45.719 customers ever do so believe it or not
00:34:47.839 there's actually math to support this so
00:34:50.040 uh Sergey brenn and Larry Page I can't
00:34:52.199 remember which one of them uh is like a
00:34:53.639 brilliant mathematician and actually was
00:34:55.199 able to prove this ratio out
00:34:58.560 and so when you're stealing from
00:34:59.800 yourself you want 70% of all of your
00:35:02.240 effort to go into basically carbon
00:35:04.280 copying the thing that works and this
00:35:06.079 works across all functions this works
00:35:07.640 for a sales script this works for
00:35:09.040 product this works for reinvestment
00:35:11.040 activities like this rule works the
00:35:13.960 second is adjacent so something that's
00:35:16.320 just like one degree removed right so
00:35:18.280 it's close to the core of what you
00:35:19.839 normally do okay so instead of saying uh
00:35:22.000 starting a school Community is the
00:35:23.280 fastest way to start an online business
00:35:24.880 right I could say that would be a hook
00:35:25.920 and it's a hook that worked I could say
00:35:28.079 um one of the fastest ways to start an
00:35:29.920 online business to start a school
00:35:31.040 Community right that would be a
00:35:32.079 variation of something that we knew that
00:35:33.560 those words worked but it would be
00:35:34.839 adjacent to it not the exact carbon copy
00:35:36.800 but similar now 10 is that means that
00:35:40.320 one out of 10 of the things that you're
00:35:41.800 putting your effort towards all right
00:35:43.240 would be something that's brand sping
00:35:44.560 new completely you know out of left
00:35:46.520 field and when you look at your effort
00:35:49.480 in your business I can almost guarantee
00:35:52.160 you that you have this flipped and I
00:35:55.440 only say this because uh I speak from
00:35:57.240 experience
00:35:58.599 um is that this is what I would do I
00:36:00.160 would spend 70% of my time on new crazy
00:36:02.280 things new ideas all the stuff that
00:36:03.680 excited me and then 20% I'd be like oh
00:36:06.000 yeah um I'll do something kind of
00:36:08.040 different from what I was doing before
00:36:09.240 and then 10% I'll be like fine I'll I'll
00:36:11.240 maybe and this is this is a maybe most
00:36:12.960 times like oh I already use that use
00:36:14.440 that Hook Once I don't want to use it
00:36:15.640 again I don't want to use the same hook
00:36:16.960 that worked before in another
00:36:19.160 ad it's silly also a different version
00:36:21.720 of uh this from an advertising
00:36:22.920 perspective of the 20% is you use the
00:36:24.359 exact same hook you have a different
00:36:25.359 background so it's uh just like a
00:36:27.280 different variation so it's like I could
00:36:28.400 wear a different shirt I could have a
00:36:29.480 different setting and I could still
00:36:30.800 deliver the same hook and to me that
00:36:32.040 would still be kind of a a 20% variation
00:36:34.880 all of your competitors are copying your
00:36:36.760 stuff and taking what's working when you
00:36:39.599 find something that's Works keep doing
00:36:41.960 it deviation from what works is more
00:36:44.359 likely not to work think about it like
00:36:46.960 this if you demolish a building so let's
00:36:49.680 say we build a building and it takes us
00:36:50.960 two years to build a building right
00:36:52.680 there's our building took us two years
00:36:54.800 demolishing it might take five minutes
00:36:58.079 just put a bomb boom because the place
00:37:00.880 of the bricks and the steel in that
00:37:02.640 building every other potentiality that
00:37:05.200 those bricks could go to create not a
00:37:07.200 building but there's only one placement
00:37:09.240 of that brick in steel that creates a
00:37:11.040 building and so you have unlimited
00:37:13.119 options for Destruction and only one for
00:37:15.520 solution and so when you do find
00:37:17.400 something that works the likelihood that
00:37:19.000 when you change it and you move the
00:37:20.079 brick and you move the you move the
00:37:21.560 scaffolding that you destroy the
00:37:22.960 building is very high something can
00:37:24.599 literally go anywhere except for the
00:37:26.000 right place and so you can have have
00:37:27.760 more options and all of them be wrong so
00:37:30.440 once you're done stealing from yourself
00:37:34.160 then let's talk about emotional versus
00:37:36.319 logical buyers this was a huge like
00:37:39.079 monstrous increase in business for me
00:37:42.400 so have you ever heard from from the
00:37:44.680 marketing world there's logical and
00:37:46.280 there's emotional buyers I had heard it
00:37:47.880 growing up and I kind of repeated it
00:37:49.119 over and over again because I hadn't
00:37:50.319 really thought about it I don't actually
00:37:52.680 think that's true and so let me explain
00:37:55.440 I actually think that there's a
00:37:57.520 Continuum of buyers that people sit on
00:38:00.000 and you've got people who require more
00:38:01.760 information so they're high info buyers
00:38:04.040 and then you've got people who require
00:38:05.200 less information and there's two
00:38:07.839 elements to this one is their
00:38:09.240 information requirement and secondarily
00:38:12.079 how much info they have received and so
00:38:14.560 you could have a high information buyer
00:38:16.240 that's further closer to this little
00:38:17.880 this dollar sign here that only needs a
00:38:19.400 little bit more information in order to
00:38:21.240 buy and then you have some people that
00:38:22.920 just generically buy lots of stuff and
00:38:25.560 everybody loves those people of course
00:38:27.079 but guess what everybody fights over
00:38:28.680 those people and so the thing is is that
00:38:31.160 the amount of low information buyers is
00:38:32.920 like this the amount of high information
00:38:35.359 buyers is an order of magnitude or
00:38:38.440 multiple orders of magnitude greater
00:38:40.280 only crazy people buy immediately it's
00:38:43.119 very normal for people to want to have
00:38:44.800 more information before making a
00:38:46.599 decision and so when we think about our
00:38:50.040 advertising the reason that the direct
00:38:51.800 response Community typically can't grow
00:38:54.280 very large businesses most of the time
00:38:56.920 is because because they only advertise
00:38:59.359 to these people and this pool of buyers
00:39:01.160 is significantly smaller but the reason
00:39:03.560 building a brand for example and
00:39:05.880 investing in an audience is because
00:39:07.560 you're trying to move them down this
00:39:09.760 line now when I heard this in the
00:39:12.000 earlier days of my career I was like I
00:39:13.800 don't have time for that I need to make
00:39:15.119 money I get it sure in the beginning you
00:39:17.119 just advertise the the six-inch putts
00:39:19.040 but when you want to scale you have to
00:39:21.720 educate a higher percentage of the
00:39:23.560 audience because they will require more
00:39:26.680 to buy
00:39:28.079 the way to move people through this is
00:39:31.079 something that Eugene Schwarz uh
00:39:33.359 pioneered in his book breakthrough
00:39:35.520 advertising and he talks about the five
00:39:38.200 levels of awareness so he has unaware
00:39:40.800 people so people have just no idea about
00:39:42.920 anything uh the next is problem aware so
00:39:46.599 they have some sort of pain you have
00:39:48.480 solution
00:39:50.520 aware you have product
00:39:53.839 aware and then you have most aware Okay
00:39:57.079 so so those are the five stages now a
00:39:59.800 customer will basically move in this
00:40:01.440 direction going from unaware to most
00:40:03.280 aware and if you want to go to broader
00:40:06.040 and broader audiences to get their
00:40:08.440 attention the unaware audience you
00:40:11.160 typically have to go off of broad
00:40:13.240 curiosity and so if you've ever seen
00:40:15.160 those crazy like ads that are like weird
00:40:17.119 articles like you know Arizona State
00:40:19.359 blah blah blah has this new blah like
00:40:21.760 they're trying to go after a massive
00:40:23.720 audience of people who have no idea
00:40:25.079 what's going on that new you know
00:40:27.800 scientific breakthrough could lead you
00:40:29.240 to buying a supplement it could lead you
00:40:30.760 to buying uh a weight loss thing it
00:40:32.599 could lead you to buying some sort of
00:40:33.839 equipment it could lead you to buying
00:40:35.079 Insurance like it could go in any
00:40:36.400 direction but it's the Curiosity that
00:40:38.319 gets them in problem aware would be
00:40:41.359 something to the extent of like do you
00:40:42.839 wake up to pee three times a night does
00:40:44.560 it hurt when you bend over to tie your
00:40:45.920 shoes do you get out of breath when you
00:40:47.720 play with your kids those are going to
00:40:49.200 be problem Weare now they again that
00:40:51.319 could lead you to a supplement that
00:40:53.119 could lead you to insurance that could
00:40:54.480 lead you to whatever but it's a slightly
00:40:56.480 more Weare person at least they're
00:40:58.079 problem aware solution aware is that
00:41:00.880 somebody knows of the potential things
00:41:03.640 that they could buy and you're helping
00:41:04.920 them select between them product aware
00:41:07.280 is at even more micro level and most
00:41:09.160 aware is typically your existing
00:41:11.040 customers so here is where you just make
00:41:13.720 offers right this is why the book offers
00:41:16.440 is where I started because the people
00:41:18.599 who are here is the tiny audience here
00:41:21.000 and so you just make an offer to get
00:41:22.440 them to buy but that only works for this
00:41:24.760 tiny audience so you will make money
00:41:26.640 quickly doing that but you will also cap
00:41:28.520 yourself quickly in an effort to figure
00:41:30.640 out okay well how much should I allocate
00:41:32.880 between these most aware less info
00:41:35.440 people and the maybe problem unaware
00:41:37.839 High information people who require more
00:41:39.640 education in order to make a purchasing
00:41:41.280 decision well I had one of the most
00:41:43.880 enlightening conversations I've had in a
00:41:45.200 really long time uh with Ben Francis
00:41:47.280 who's the CEO of Jim shark and then he
00:41:49.000 introduced me to Chris Davis who's the
00:41:51.119 CMO of New Balance and so we had an
00:41:54.200 awesome conversation talking about what
00:41:56.040 Chris had done at New Balance and help
00:41:57.560 them just Skyrocket their sales and so
00:42:00.760 what they did is that when he took over
00:42:03.839 30% of their advertising budget was
00:42:06.319 going to here was going to the broad
00:42:08.839 awareness level storytelling emotional
00:42:10.960 stuff and then 70% was basically geared
00:42:13.920 towards buying shoes saying hey go buy
00:42:15.480 these shoes what he did when he took
00:42:17.720 over was that he flipped them that he
00:42:19.640 ended up with 70% going to Big highlevel
00:42:23.359 pairings endorsements uh specific
00:42:26.000 athletes that they wanted to recruit
00:42:27.160 recuit that they felt represented their
00:42:28.680 brand and only 30% of their advertising
00:42:31.599 budget went towards actually telling
00:42:33.920 people that they had shoes and that they
00:42:35.240 were for sale and so after he made that
00:42:38.760 flip here's the crazy part it took 18
00:42:41.680 months for them to see the return on
00:42:44.800 that budget and so if you're in a rush
00:42:47.480 this isn't going to work but if you're
00:42:48.839 in a rush you're never going to get big
00:42:50.559 anyways keeping this ratio made this
00:42:53.520 concept Tactical for me and so when I
00:42:56.040 think about my marketing effort my
00:42:57.720 marketing dollars and most importantly
00:42:59.440 how I measure it my marketing
00:43:00.960 Impressions I want to make sure that 70%
00:43:03.640 or more of the advertising Impressions
00:43:06.079 that someone's going to get are going to
00:43:07.599 be around the pairings that I want of me
00:43:09.920 giving something rather than asking so
00:43:11.880 when we look at this ratio this is
00:43:14.200 actually super well studied between 70
00:43:16.079 and 30% here because right now uh it's
00:43:19.520 actually three and a half to one is the
00:43:22.400 ratio that has been studied 3.5
00:43:25.280 to1 of give
00:43:28.200 to ask to basically not lose audience
00:43:32.800 and so if you look at television for
00:43:34.359 example and they've already studied how
00:43:35.480 many commercials can we jam into the
00:43:36.960 show before people stop watching and so
00:43:39.359 they figured it out that it was every
00:43:41.720 three and a half minutes of content they
00:43:43.640 could basically put one minute of
00:43:45.319 advertising in if you look at your
00:43:46.960 Facebook Newsfeed for every three posts
00:43:49.000 you get when you scroll you'll get one
00:43:51.040 ad and the platforms that grow the
00:43:53.359 fastest have a larger percentage of this
00:43:55.960 give and a small percentage of ask Tik
00:43:58.359 Tok for years had zero ads on the
00:44:00.680 platform and just wanted to grow as
00:44:02.440 virally as possible and they acquired
00:44:04.440 more users because they had a give first
00:44:06.200 give all the time strategy and so the
00:44:08.839 fact that they settled on this ratio and
00:44:11.559 it has been corroborated fancy word for
00:44:13.400 it it's worked in multiple other places
00:44:15.680 made me think wow there's something to
00:44:18.040 this and so this makes this concept of
00:44:20.920 how do I balance High information buyers
00:44:23.520 people that need more brand people that
00:44:25.520 need more education prior to purchase
00:44:27.480 with me making money is that you
00:44:29.400 basically start with that ratio add
00:44:31.760 patience in time and then it becomes a
00:44:33.839 snowball that compounds unto itself and
00:44:36.079 then you will get to a point in the
00:44:37.200 future where you still you're doing so
00:44:39.839 much more than you could ever possibly
00:44:42.559 do if you only focused on the direct
00:44:44.079 response on the less information but
00:44:46.319 you're actually still digging the well
00:44:48.160 for what you're going to do next year
00:44:49.839 and so basically you can see when a
00:44:51.480 Founder stops running a business and
00:44:52.839 then the corporate execs come in because
00:44:54.599 what they do is they flip the ratio they
00:44:56.319 basically pull pull forward demand from
00:44:58.160 the future they you had the the the
00:45:00.200 founder dug the well and then they just
00:45:02.000 suck all the water out of the well but
00:45:03.640 then they didn't dig the next well and
00:45:05.400 so you always going to be ahead of
00:45:06.720 demand I'll give you even more tactics
00:45:08.920 if you guys want more TCT fine I'll give
00:45:10.200 you more tactics so B2B businesses and B
00:45:13.520 Toc businesses do this differently and
00:45:15.040 this was something that took me a really
00:45:16.240 long time to figure out and so B Toc
00:45:18.800 businesses so like business to Consumer
00:45:20.800 businesses will typically do these types
00:45:23.920 of pairings in terms of high information
00:45:25.839 buyers by telling emotional stories
00:45:28.240 making associations getting endorsements
00:45:30.839 from athletes and influencers or
00:45:32.599 organizations that represent the values
00:45:34.640 that they think resonate positively with
00:45:36.280 their ideal audience and once they do
00:45:38.680 that they then can place the product
00:45:40.559 next to those associations so that they
00:45:42.160 can then pair them and then the person
00:45:43.559 wants to buy the product as a
00:45:44.880 consequence that is what it looks like
00:45:46.640 in a b2c business but it took me a
00:45:49.079 really long time to think through well
00:45:50.520 what does this look like for a B2B
00:45:52.240 business and so I break this down into
00:45:55.359 several tactical things so number one is
00:45:58.760 aspirational outcomes that you have
00:46:01.319 achieved or the business has helped
00:46:03.240 facilitate secondarily people like this
00:46:06.599 person like your avatar that you have
00:46:08.800 help facilitat so just to be clear stuff
00:46:10.520 that you did stuff that you help other
00:46:11.599 people do the third is stuff that you
00:46:14.440 help them do the prospect themselves
00:46:17.599 which you can only facilitate at least
00:46:19.319 in my opinion in two major ways one is
00:46:21.599 that you give them free content and
00:46:22.839 education which is why I make this stuff
00:46:24.599 and the second is that you give them
00:46:25.599 free products and services which just
00:46:26.800 why why the books are free they're on my
00:46:28.880 site you can read them you consume them
00:46:30.480 there's a scaling road map there
00:46:31.680 personaliz all that stuff is free
00:46:34.400 because fundamentally it's two degrees
00:46:37.559 of separation if some person does it
00:46:39.680 Alex had a big exit now he's a big
00:46:41.040 portfolio cool that's two degrees of
00:46:42.720 separation there's other companies in
00:46:44.640 the portfolio or other businesses who
00:46:46.119 look just like mine that he helps scale
00:46:48.079 one degree separation I used his stuff
00:46:50.960 and made more money zero degrees of
00:46:52.960 separation and this is always going to
00:46:54.839 be stronger than anything else but it'll
00:46:57.160 take longer and so in understanding the
00:46:59.480 difference between B Toc and B2B in
00:47:00.800 terms of what do I do top of funnel here
00:47:03.040 how do I allocate my resources it means
00:47:04.760 that I'm spending time putting together
00:47:07.280 the course in my spare time so that you
00:47:09.160 guys can go consume it on uh how to make
00:47:11.800 offers how to get leads how to Scale
00:47:13.280 company from Z to 100 million like
00:47:15.119 that's time that's effort that's my team
00:47:17.559 who's behind the camera right now that's
00:47:18.960 budget that goes towards that because
00:47:21.079 I'm not looking for demand today I'm
00:47:23.240 looking for those of you who are going
00:47:24.400 to scale your companies and in 5 years
00:47:25.960 hit me up let's say acis.com went public
00:47:28.040 tomorrow and I got AED for being rude
00:47:30.000 which I probably would and then they put
00:47:31.280 in a new CEO and that new CEO says I
00:47:34.160 need to hit quarterly earnings so what
00:47:35.440 would he probably do he' probably switch
00:47:37.319 to lots of direct response uh and he'd
00:47:40.200 probably cut down all the budget on the
00:47:41.800 gives and the books and all of a sudden
00:47:44.119 be like well there's no Roi In A Book
00:47:46.079 Like books don't make any money it's
00:47:47.480 like yeah not today but they bring
00:47:51.040 people into our world and when they do
00:47:53.960 have the next billion dollar company
00:47:55.599 they will hit us up first
00:47:57.559 and that's the goal but that guy will
00:47:59.760 just say well you know what screw all
00:48:01.040 that I'm going to recapture all this
00:48:02.559 marketing spending effort we're going to
00:48:03.839 focus it all on these direct response
00:48:05.240 ads tell people to buy bye byy and you
00:48:06.920 know what for a quarter it'll work maybe
00:48:08.480 two quarters it'll work but all of a
00:48:09.720 sudden it'll start slowly going down
00:48:11.720 slowly going down slowly going down then
00:48:13.280 what happens they call the founder back
00:48:14.760 up and they're like hey help help help
00:48:16.880 us fix this and then the founder is
00:48:18.119 going to say I can't do it in a quarter
00:48:20.359 like it's going to take me a year year
00:48:21.760 and a half to basically right siiz the
00:48:23.400 ship because you sucked all the wells
00:48:25.160 dry and I'm gonna have to start digging
00:48:26.520 again so the next one is some of my
00:48:28.160 marketing laws so I'm going to give you
00:48:29.599 a few of them and I'll start with the
00:48:30.880 first one that you if you've heard my
00:48:32.079 channel then you should know this one it
00:48:33.280 should be ingrained in your brain which
00:48:35.200 is State the facts and tell the truth
00:48:37.559 and the reason this is so important to
00:48:39.119 me is that it forces me as a Advertiser
00:48:43.760 business person to change reality and so
00:48:48.599 rather than try and exaggerate it makes
00:48:51.720 more sense to put all of the effort into
00:48:54.160 doing epic stuff and then telling a
00:48:56.079 truthful story rather than telling an
00:48:57.920 epic story about something that was
00:48:59.520 underwhelming and I think the vast
00:49:01.119 majority of marketers and marketing do
00:49:03.160 the second thing they have something
00:49:05.200 normal and then they TR try and tell an
00:49:06.799 exaggerated story of it rather than
00:49:08.559 having something absolutely insane and
00:49:10.480 just stating the facts and telling the
00:49:11.680 truth and I can tell you that the second
00:49:13.680 this one stating the facts and telling
00:49:15.079 the truth is the best long-term strategy
00:49:17.680 and so how do I actionized this all
00:49:19.559 right so number one is that we make the
00:49:21.200 truth more compelling all right we
00:49:22.920 actually change reality the second is
00:49:24.599 that we show only what we can show
00:49:27.240 and so I remember I was talking to a
00:49:28.799 martial arts guy and he's like there's
00:49:30.880 all these other martial arts studios you
00:49:32.559 know in my area how do I stand out and I
00:49:34.880 said well what's your you know what's
00:49:36.480 your specialty or whatever and he said
00:49:37.799 I'm a double secret black belt of
00:49:39.680 something and I said okay well how many
00:49:41.160 double secret black belts he's like well
00:49:42.319 there's only six in the nation and I was
00:49:43.520 like okay well do any of them live in
00:49:44.839 your era and he said no I was like well
00:49:46.880 why don't you say that right why don't
00:49:49.079 you say that so every business if you
00:49:51.640 get narrow enough has something that's
00:49:53.200 unique about it you might have the best
00:49:54.960 parking you might have uh the fastest
00:49:57.760 you know introduction to getting
00:49:58.960 somebody to sit down you might have the
00:50:01.000 most gyms you know whatever it is the
00:50:02.640 most customers the most customers at a
00:50:04.280 certain price point the most like you
00:50:06.160 just need to slice the data of the
00:50:07.640 business to figure out what is unique
00:50:09.240 about your business and I remember this
00:50:10.760 moment in uh Madmen which is a an
00:50:13.480 advertising show it's like an old 50
00:50:15.079 show well it's a new show about the 50s
00:50:17.440 anyways and Don Draper who's the lead
00:50:19.599 character who's an advertising guy um is
00:50:21.760 pitching a client who's a cigarette
00:50:23.119 company and they're trying they're like
00:50:25.000 the third or fourth in the category
00:50:27.000 highly commoditized they're competing on
00:50:28.640 price and they're losing and so he asks
00:50:32.040 them to explain how cigarettes are made
00:50:34.200 and they kind of roll their eyes they're
00:50:35.319 like why is this important he's like
00:50:36.720 okay well first we have the plants then
00:50:38.440 we take and he keeps going through it
00:50:39.680 he's and he's like and then we you know
00:50:41.000 we let we let it sit out in the sun he's
00:50:43.040 like what do you mean he's like you know
00:50:44.640 to to to dry out the leads he's like so
00:50:46.680 you toast them he's like yeah we toast
00:50:49.040 them he's like it's toasted and so that
00:50:52.839 was a unique part he just sliced down
00:50:55.760 and got really narrow
00:50:57.240 about one particular part of the process
00:50:58.920 and was able to pull that out and
00:51:00.319 emphasize it so that people are like oh
00:51:02.680 this is different than other things and
00:51:05.000 the really important part about this is
00:51:06.480 that maybe some of the other cigarette
00:51:08.160 companies also toast it but they don't
00:51:11.400 say that they toast it and so the
00:51:13.440 perception is still that it's different
00:51:15.319 even if it is the same and so the best
00:51:18.040 version of this is finding something
00:51:19.319 that's truly unique the second best
00:51:21.319 version is to just say something that's
00:51:22.920 unique about something that everyone
00:51:24.079 else already does but that your
00:51:25.160 customers don't know
00:51:27.119 and so the the correlator to that is say
00:51:30.599 what only you can say so you show what
00:51:32.640 only you can show and you say what only
00:51:34.559 you can say so the showing part is going
00:51:36.640 to be like okay with the toasting thing
00:51:38.400 how do we display that visually with the
00:51:40.400 super secret blackp then how do we
00:51:42.000 display that and you could show the
00:51:42.960 black belt you could show you shaking
00:51:44.079 your hands getting the certification you
00:51:45.520 could show you winning some tournament
00:51:47.000 right if you're if you're toasting you
00:51:48.640 could show the bed of all the the
00:51:50.040 debacco that's getting toasted and the
00:51:51.920 smells and the wafting through the air
00:51:53.359 whatever right and then you describe it
00:51:55.200 in a way that only you can say
00:51:57.760 and so to do this you get narrower to be
00:52:01.400 more unique and so the thing is is that
00:52:03.480 you don't need to be the best in the
00:52:04.920 world you need to be the best in a
00:52:06.480 puddle it's more important that you are
00:52:08.799 the best than what you are the best of I
00:52:11.319 would rather be from a marketing
00:52:14.119 perspective not absolutely I'd rather
00:52:15.760 have the 10th biggest company in the
00:52:16.920 world right than the first biggest
00:52:18.839 company uh in Indiana but from an
00:52:21.839 advertising perspective it is more
00:52:23.400 compelling to be the best and I'll tell
00:52:25.559 you a story that I haven't told
00:52:27.480 um John Rockefeller when he uh was early
00:52:32.200 on in his oil
00:52:34.680 Empire bid to buy the biggest oil
00:52:38.559 refinery in Cincinnati and he was the
00:52:41.359 second biggest and he ended up
00:52:44.799 overpaying for the business and the
00:52:47.160 business owner of the oil refinery
00:52:49.400 laughed at him and kind of laughed his
00:52:50.799 way to the bank he's like you completely
00:52:52.200 overpaid for this thing and so then what
00:52:54.280 John D Rockefeller did after he bought
00:52:56.720 the second the the first biggest and he
00:52:58.520 already had the second biggest is that
00:53:00.359 he then was able to say he was the
00:53:02.400 biggest and then in the next 30 days he
00:53:05.119 had over 20 m&a deals in the next 30
00:53:08.559 days to consolidate the entire rest of
00:53:11.079 the market because he became the
00:53:13.000 Gilla and so he was willing to overpay
00:53:16.599 for the asset to get the story the
00:53:19.839 difference in value between what he
00:53:22.160 should have paid for those 20 deals and
00:53:24.160 what he was able to pay by strong arming
00:53:26.200 those smaller competitors because he was
00:53:28.520 now the gorilla more than made up for
00:53:30.960 what he minorly overpaid or maybe even
00:53:32.960 majorly overpaid for the one company
00:53:35.040 that he bought and when he recants the
00:53:36.839 story when he tells the story again he
00:53:39.079 talks about how that competitor didn't
00:53:42.319 see the bigger picture and that was
00:53:45.119 always it was such a I remember reading
00:53:46.640 it in in the letters that he wrote to
00:53:48.079 his son and thinking to myself that is
00:53:51.760 powerful he was willing to overpay for
00:53:54.280 the story he saw it as an investment in
00:53:56.920 his brand in his reputation and so the
00:53:59.319 guy who sold it just saw it as him
00:54:01.040 overpaying for a product but he wasn't
00:54:03.200 appropriately valuing how much true
00:54:05.720 brand value that would give Rockefeller
00:54:07.799 as a result the next big growth lever is
00:54:10.799 all about the list all right so when I
00:54:14.240 talk about the list people immediately
00:54:15.880 think that I'm talking about email list
00:54:17.280 Direct Mail list and sometimes that's
00:54:18.599 true but I'll give you a hypothetical
00:54:20.079 example so let's say I am selling winter
00:54:23.640 coats and I advertise an amazing offer
00:54:27.200 on some killer coats that people love
00:54:29.599 they look amazing and nothing comes back
00:54:32.200 well what could have happened well if I
00:54:34.799 showed my advertisement to people who
00:54:36.480 live in South Florida the likelihood
00:54:38.559 that they buy my very expensive really
00:54:40.680 heavy and hot winter coats is very low
00:54:43.200 it has nothing to do with my offer
00:54:44.960 nothing to do with the ad creative
00:54:46.319 nothing to do with my pricing nothing to
00:54:48.160 do with anything it's just the wrong
00:54:49.520 people are seeing it and so many smaller
00:54:53.599 businesses think that marketing doesn't
00:54:56.119 work work when in reality they were
00:54:58.200 showing to the wrong people and so the
00:55:00.680 first thing that you have to get right
00:55:02.160 in marketing is targeting the correct
00:55:04.839 audience and so this is different by
00:55:07.839 method of advertising and so if we pull
00:55:11.079 up our core four here you want to reach
00:55:13.160 out to people that you know are
00:55:15.480 suffering from the problem that you
00:55:17.160 solve or have a high likelihood of
00:55:19.240 suffering from the problem that you
00:55:20.359 solve and the narrower the problem the
00:55:22.359 smaller the list from a paid ads
00:55:24.880 perspective this is where the target
00:55:26.319 targeting by platform gets more
00:55:27.640 important and this is why some ad
00:55:29.079 platforms tend to be more profitable
00:55:30.359 than others because what makes an
00:55:31.599 advertising platform successful is how
00:55:33.839 well targeted is in fact Facebook was so
00:55:36.480 good that they had to roll it back
00:55:37.599 because of privacy loss but it was so
00:55:39.720 effective at targeting people that
00:55:40.960 people complained because it was so good
00:55:42.280 it felt creepy posting content this is
00:55:44.880 where the algorithm itself based on this
00:55:47.599 is what's crazy what you look like and
00:55:50.599 how you talk and what you say will
00:55:52.920 impact what the AI serves your content
00:55:56.000 to the same works with paid ads and so
00:55:58.839 if I want to get more women to buy a
00:56:02.520 product guess who I'm not going to have
00:56:04.200 in the ad me because this is not what
00:56:07.599 attracts lots of ladies right this is
00:56:09.880 just usually a bunch of entrepreneurs
00:56:11.559 who T have beards and like Fitness or
00:56:14.400 whatever else right but like my audience
00:56:16.440 is like 89% male and sure for for my 11%
00:56:20.119 females keep rocking I appreciate you um
00:56:22.760 but by and large I have a male driven
00:56:24.480 audience now maybe it's because I talk
00:56:25.799 about money but there's tons of female
00:56:27.559 entrepreneurs who talk about money and
00:56:29.280 don't have predominant male audiences
00:56:30.960 and so it's just that my way of saying
00:56:32.559 things and or the algorithm just tends
00:56:34.520 to display it to dudes and so one of the
00:56:37.000 easiest ways to make sure that you're
00:56:38.760 displaying your ads to the right Avatar
00:56:41.079 is make sure that the person in the ad
00:56:42.839 looks like the Avatar and I'll tell you
00:56:44.720 a funny story so when I was running the
00:56:48.039 gym launch 1.0 version which is where we
00:56:49.760 used to fly out to gyms and do the
00:56:51.359 turnarounds I found out that when I put
00:56:53.640 the thank you page this is before
00:56:55.200 automated schedulers even existed so
00:56:56.760 it's kind of wild all right um I
00:56:58.599 remember when I my first automated
00:57:00.039 schedule to put on the thank you page I
00:57:01.280 thought I had like i' i' cured cancer I
00:57:03.400 was like this is the coolest thing
00:57:04.839 people can automatically book like I
00:57:06.599 don't have to call them and work the
00:57:07.559 lead um and so anyways the thank you
00:57:10.280 page that I set up uh was just like hey
00:57:13.000 text this number and then the second
00:57:14.880 version of the thank you page was hey my
00:57:16.920 name's Alex I'm going to be calling you
00:57:18.319 so I put a picture of me and I said I'm
00:57:19.920 going be calling you from this number so
00:57:21.400 I tried to put some visual to it then
00:57:23.960 when I put Lela picture on the thank you
00:57:25.760 page and said Leila is going to be the
00:57:27.760 one contacting you what do you know our
00:57:30.400 response rates went through the roof
00:57:32.119 people were immediately responsive they
00:57:33.559 were showing up to appointments they
00:57:34.799 were oh yeah sure I can make five o' for
00:57:37.000 me they're like oh no I don't give a
00:57:38.799 right and so if you want to attract a
00:57:40.839 certain Avatar try to make sure that uh
00:57:43.880 what is in your content how you talk uh
00:57:46.319 matches the way they talk because
00:57:47.799 fundamentally all marketing works as
00:57:51.039 long as you get the targeting right it's
00:57:53.280 like think about this way if you walked
00:57:55.880 into room this is how I like to
00:57:57.400 visualize marketing because people
00:57:58.599 people over complicate it if I walked
00:58:00.520 into a room and I got on stage and there
00:58:02.119 was a thousand people in the room if
00:58:04.039 those thousand people were my deal
00:58:05.559 customers then even if I had just like a
00:58:08.640 really mediocre offer and uh a something
00:58:12.400 that they like kind of wanted I would
00:58:14.480 get some response now it might not be
00:58:16.720 efficient it might not get me the return
00:58:18.520 I want so I might lose money but I might
00:58:20.839 I would probably make something right I
00:58:22.680 would get some clicks I would get some
00:58:24.039 leads right and so it would allow me to
00:58:26.160 start the feedback loop so I could
00:58:27.440 improve but if nothing is coming through
00:58:30.200 it's typically because the wrong people
00:58:31.280 are seeing it and so one of the highest
00:58:33.119 leverage ways of getting more from
00:58:34.400 advertising is just making sure that the
00:58:36.839 right people are seeing it which is a
00:58:39.160 perfect transition into the next one
00:58:40.720 which is how do you know that you've
00:58:42.480 mastered something which is that Masters
00:58:45.599 have more ways to win now what does that
00:58:48.200 actually
00:58:49.240 mean they understand the many different
00:58:52.400 ways that you can measure progress so if
00:58:55.480 you were to talk to an HR professional
00:58:58.359 okay and you ask them what do you do a
00:59:01.359 lot of times they're going to give you a
00:59:02.319 couple vague answers they're like you
00:59:03.520 know I'll payroll and I'll uh I'll make
00:59:06.160 sure that people get in their benefits
00:59:07.440 and whatever but when you talk to
00:59:09.680 someone who's a master at this and I
00:59:10.799 remember the first time I had somebody
00:59:12.200 who who completely improved my
00:59:14.400 understanding of talent and acquisition
00:59:15.760 and recruiting um in the interview the
00:59:19.440 candidate said oh um well what's your
00:59:22.359 time to fill and I was like what do you
00:59:23.680 mean she's like well the average time to
00:59:25.440 fill a role I was like I don't know
00:59:27.799 she's like oh well what's your what's
00:59:29.119 your two-sided fit I was like I don't
00:59:31.520 know what you mean and so she was like
00:59:34.079 okay uh what's your cost uh to acquire
00:59:36.640 talent I was like I don't know and so
00:59:40.920 she had all of these different metrics
00:59:43.000 that she was using to measure which
00:59:44.359 completely made sense to me like I have
00:59:45.680 cost to acquire a customer I should have
00:59:47.200 cost to acquire talent I should have you
00:59:49.599 know what's my cash conversion cycle how
00:59:51.280 quickly do I get my first sale how
00:59:52.799 quickly do I fill a role and then in
00:59:54.760 terms of like customer satisfaction
00:59:56.119 action is basically employee
00:59:57.160 satisfaction of How likely is it that
00:59:59.760 the manager and the employee both say at
01:00:03.119 day 90 that this is a 10 out of 10 fit
01:00:05.680 and so when I started looking at that I
01:00:06.799 was like oh wow there's a total there's
01:00:08.440 a whole another level of understanding
01:00:10.760 this that I I had no idea about because
01:00:13.119 Masters have a higher quality and
01:00:15.839 quantity of metrics that they use to
01:00:17.839 measure progress and so if I am trying
01:00:21.160 to fix this function I have nothing to
01:00:23.200 know how well I'm doing and so a
01:00:25.359 beginner will try to advertise or will
01:00:27.640 try to sell and they will have binary
01:00:29.559 outcomes they'll just say I didn't sell
01:00:31.079 or I did sell or I got leads or I didn't
01:00:32.760 get leads but there are so many Nuance
01:00:35.359 steps between that and when you have the
01:00:38.920 Milestones the progress markers it
01:00:41.079 allows you to fix things so you can keep
01:00:42.880 moving the buck along until you get the
01:00:44.520 outcome and so I'll tell you a story
01:00:46.039 about this so when I was starting
01:00:49.039 outbound way back in the day I it was a
01:00:52.039 new channel for us and I'd never done it
01:00:54.440 and about 90 days or or or 4 months in
01:00:58.720 my executive team kind of did like an
01:01:00.599 intervention so they came together I was
01:01:02.520 like I was getting like a drug rehab
01:01:03.960 right they were like we think this is a
01:01:05.760 problem we think this is a shiny object
01:01:07.480 we think you're you're distracted and we
01:01:09.280 should double down on what works I was
01:01:10.599 like how dare you use my words against
01:01:12.039 me right and the thing is is that
01:01:14.319 strategically I knew we needed to have a
01:01:15.880 second acquisition channel for us to
01:01:17.079 sell the business and so I was like no
01:01:20.559 it's because they could only see that
01:01:22.520 we'd only done one sale in four months
01:01:24.160 and 100% of my time was going to towards
01:01:26.280 this but what they didn't see was all
01:01:28.079 the progress that we were making and so
01:01:29.920 I had hirer degrees of Mastery in this
01:01:31.880 now to be fair it was just because I had
01:01:33.200 learned it along the way but when it
01:01:34.760 started it was like okay well we have to
01:01:36.640 get a list so where do we get the list
01:01:37.839 so we looked at you know we bought a
01:01:38.799 bunch of different list a lot of lists
01:01:40.039 didn't work one of them did we're like
01:01:41.160 okay this is a good provider and then we
01:01:42.599 start you know like oh we got to enrich
01:01:43.960 the DAT so we start learning how to
01:01:44.920 enrich the day then we we started
01:01:46.240 calling them but then no one was picking
01:01:47.319 up and then we had to learn how call
01:01:48.839 wrapping works we get local numbers and
01:01:50.520 then all of a sudden people start
01:01:51.279 picking up and then started hanging up
01:01:52.279 on us and then we had to fix the the
01:01:53.520 hook in the script and then we fix the
01:01:55.000 hook in the script people would a minute
01:01:56.319 but then they'd hang up on us so then we
01:01:57.520 got we fix the hook and then we fix the
01:01:58.799 offer and then people would then go to
01:02:00.000 the second call but then they weren't
01:02:01.160 showing up for the second call and so
01:02:02.440 it's like we have to just keep moving
01:02:04.799 the buck along the way but if you looked
01:02:06.799 at it two months in it's like you know a
01:02:08.839 heart surgery looks like murder to
01:02:10.559 somebody from the outside who doesn't
01:02:12.079 understand the milestones and so as you
01:02:14.359 master something if you don't know why
01:02:15.880 something's not working look closer look
01:02:18.000 for the smaller attributes that you can
01:02:20.000 actually zoom in on and say okay well I
01:02:22.119 we'll get a sale eventually if we just
01:02:23.760 keep moving in this direction and so
01:02:25.480 look for directional correctness rather
01:02:27.240 than binary and so this is a perfect
01:02:29.520 example of Masters have more leading
01:02:31.799 indicators to success than beginners too
01:02:34.480 beginners typically look at purely the
01:02:36.279 lagging indicat they just say churn is
01:02:37.760 up they sales are down revenue is down
01:02:39.640 cash collection down those are all
01:02:40.880 lagging indicators you can't if I looked
01:02:42.400 at you and said increase Revenue you
01:02:43.880 can't do anything if I said decrease
01:02:45.279 turn you can't do anything with that you
01:02:47.039 would then have to do something else and
01:02:48.359 then the result would be a decrease in
01:02:49.760 turn the result would be more Revenue
01:02:51.240 the result would be more sales and so we
01:02:53.279 have to do we have to identify what all
01:02:55.240 those steps are are that are high
01:02:57.079 correlates or increase the likelihood
01:02:58.599 that ultimate outcome occurs and if you
01:03:01.039 like these growth principles you're
01:03:02.640 absolutely going to love the 13 years of
01:03:05.119 marketing lessons that I've learned it's
01:03:06.359 one of my top videos enjoy it
