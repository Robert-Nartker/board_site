00:00:00.080 two out of three businesses fail and so
00:00:03.040 that means within 10 years if we were to
00:00:04.920 look back at these business owners two
00:00:06.919 out of three are out of the game every
00:00:09.599 business that I've started since 2016
00:00:11.519 still continues to make money to this
00:00:13.000 day so here's how to make your business
00:00:14.360 Unstoppable there's three steps it
00:00:16.440 starts with stop selling small customers
00:00:19.279 your business May Fail not because you
00:00:22.240 are a failure but maybe because the
00:00:24.080 customers you serve are failures let me
00:00:26.119 tell you a story to explain this so
00:00:28.439 there was a small M CRM back in the day
00:00:31.439 that approached me about investing I
00:00:33.399 asked them what their turn was so what
00:00:34.879 percentage of customers were leaving
00:00:36.160 between last month and this month and
00:00:38.280 their answer surprised me it was a much
00:00:40.280 higher percentage than I expected
00:00:41.680 because I thought a CRM they're
00:00:42.960 processing their payments through here
00:00:43.920 they have all their memberships in there
00:00:45.000 like this should be a very sticky
00:00:46.160 product and I said so where is the churn
00:00:47.760 coming from and they said oh well about
00:00:50.120 a third of the gyms go out of business
00:00:51.840 every year and I was like Wow wait a
00:00:54.160 second so this has nothing to do with
00:00:56.760 how good your product or service was
00:00:58.559 these businesses in and of themselves
00:01:00.600 just stopped being in business the
00:01:02.760 formal language for that is called
00:01:04.559 structural turn it means it's like it's
00:01:06.720 based it's baked into the structure of
00:01:08.400 the market that you serve now the
00:01:10.280 question is is that your choice to
00:01:12.000 pursue that market and the answer is yes
00:01:14.560 a lot of business owners struggle in the
00:01:16.240 business and they look at everything
00:01:17.960 except for the most important thing
00:01:19.280 which is they they messed up the pick
00:01:21.119 Chick-fil-A's head of people gives a
00:01:22.360 great example of this when they talk
00:01:24.000 about actually Talent selection but I
00:01:25.360 think the parallel holds they said most
00:01:29.280 people lose in the NBA in the
00:01:31.840 Championships and wonder what they did
00:01:33.280 wrong in the game when in reality they
00:01:35.040 lost in the draft as and they didn't
00:01:36.720 have the right people on the team and so
00:01:38.439 if you think about your business as an
00:01:39.680 ecosystem the right people in the team
00:01:41.520 has to be all the stakeholders including
00:01:43.600 the customers and so if you're thinking
00:01:45.640 about your own business there are many
00:01:48.200 business models that simply aren't fit
00:01:50.799 for smaller customers and so I'll give
00:01:52.600 you a different example in the agency
00:01:54.200 world where you do some sort of
00:01:55.799 advertising for any type of business if
00:01:57.560 you look at some of the biggest ad
00:01:58.920 agencies in the world you'll notice a
00:02:00.439 common theme they all serve the biggest
00:02:02.560 customers in the world whereas if it
00:02:04.479 were true that agencies would be best
00:02:07.159 served serving small customers then some
00:02:09.399 of the biggest agencies would serve some
00:02:11.200 of the smallest customers but that's not
00:02:13.440 reality in looking at this it means that
00:02:16.160 just like the CRM business and that's
00:02:18.280 arguably one of the stickiest businesses
00:02:20.120 you could possibly imagine the
00:02:23.160 agencies could not keep churn down with
00:02:27.319 small business owners because small
00:02:29.080 business owners in of themselves are
00:02:31.560 volatile let me give you a visual so
00:02:33.160 let's imagine this is kind of
00:02:34.640 representing the the es and flows of the
00:02:37.160 revenue of a small business now let's
00:02:39.280 say they decide to work with you here
00:02:41.640 they say you know what we're going to
00:02:42.959 sign up with you and you get paid now
00:02:45.280 maybe you start advertising the business
00:02:47.080 and then the next month they make a
00:02:48.159 little bit more money hooray everyone's
00:02:49.959 happy now the next month the normal
00:02:52.280 volatility occurs or maybe because you
00:02:54.280 sent them more customers than they could
00:02:55.599 handle they say hey maybe we need to
00:02:56.840 ease off a little bit and all of a
00:02:58.360 sudden they think to themselves wait a
00:02:59.640 second
00:03:00.440 I'm back in the same position I was
00:03:02.000 before but now I've got still more
00:03:04.239 customers than I had before that and now
00:03:06.560 you know what I'm actually making less
00:03:08.519 money the next month and so what happens
00:03:10.599 here
00:03:12.640 they they become one of these for you
00:03:16.120 they cancel right this is the point of
00:03:18.280 cancellation and so what happens is that
00:03:20.280 there's many businesses like small
00:03:22.159 agencies that do lead generation for
00:03:24.120 small customers and continue to wonder
00:03:26.440 what do I need to do in order to make my
00:03:29.280 business sticky and they kill themselves
00:03:31.319 trying to figure it out when the problem
00:03:33.040 is inherent to who they serve is that
00:03:35.519 they are volatile and as a result your
00:03:37.760 business will be volatile too it
00:03:39.720 reflects on to you now to give you an
00:03:42.400 absolute hypothetical extreme here to
00:03:43.879 give you an example Shopify is what most
00:03:47.599 would consider world class or
00:03:49.400 best-in-class for customer retention but
00:03:52.239 they serve by and large prosumers
00:03:55.079 meaning consumers who want to start a
00:03:56.680 business and let me give you a stat that
00:03:59.079 might blow you away
00:04:01.040 60% of their customer stay year but 40%
00:04:05.079 leave and that's the best in the world
00:04:09.159 and so in thinking about this you'll
00:04:11.680 typically need to have a business that
00:04:13.920 has almost a zero cost of servicing the
00:04:17.120 smallest business owners if that's the
00:04:19.478 game you want to play if you want to be
00:04:21.519 Walmart then you have to orient your
00:04:23.880 entire strategy on basically a zeroc
00:04:26.680 cost basis for providing value which
00:04:28.840 works in softare Ware companies or like
00:04:31.240 Walmart where the entire model is
00:04:33.240 structured such that it creates the
00:04:35.160 smallest cost to them so their
00:04:37.759 alternative is really not having it at
00:04:39.680 all right now there was one agency that
00:04:42.840 did really well with this Mutual
00:04:44.759 acquaintance of mine what he did was
00:04:47.080 that he basically provided marketing
00:04:49.840 services but for about
00:04:51.880 $299 per month now what he realized was
00:04:56.080 this vola and this was a guy who used to
00:04:57.600 charge a lot more than that what he
00:04:59.160 realized is that with this volatility he
00:05:01.199 had to price
00:05:02.520 to their worst month and so it's like
00:05:05.639 okay what's the lowest part of this this
00:05:07.880 volatile range this wave of Revenue that
00:05:10.400 these small businesses are going to
00:05:11.560 encounter okay well then I'll just put
00:05:13.400 my price here and that way I'm so cheap
00:05:16.960 that they'll never cancel and the cost
00:05:19.600 of them doing the services that he
00:05:21.000 rendered which was actually far less
00:05:23.120 than the guys who were charging call it
00:05:24.639 $1,500 a month which is probably like
00:05:26.720 the industry standard for a small
00:05:28.560 business or local local business lead
00:05:30.440 genen all of a sudden he's one fifth the
00:05:32.560 price but he just provided still more
00:05:35.880 value than the $300 and so it still felt
00:05:38.639 like a good deal here because all you
00:05:40.319 would do is you would optimize their
00:05:41.560 Google stuff get them a few leads a few
00:05:43.759 phone calls a month and for them they're
00:05:45.319 like okay if I get a couple customers
00:05:46.840 it's worth it this it's so expensive
00:05:49.479 relative to what they made that if you
00:05:51.240 weren't saving the day every single
00:05:52.840 month the question they'll always ask is
00:05:54.560 what have you done for me lately this is
00:05:56.039 one of the big misconceptions that
00:05:57.440 business owners have and I've made this
00:05:58.880 myself we which is you see this right
00:06:01.039 you see this Delta that you created
00:06:02.840 you're like look you went from $1 sign
00:06:04.280 to $2 signs all of this extra money was
00:06:06.599 because of me right but the thing is is
00:06:09.080 that if you make someone $10,000 right
00:06:11.919 in the first month you work with them
00:06:13.400 and let's say you charge them a th000 in
00:06:15.039 your mind you say oh well this 9k is
00:06:18.240 because of me which means I just bought
00:06:20.440 another nine months of service with you
00:06:23.000 right because I made you $9,000 I charge
00:06:24.759 1,000 bucks a month so I could basically
00:06:26.319 just break even for the next N9 months
00:06:27.759 but try actually having that
00:06:29.039 conversation in reality it doesn't work
00:06:31.199 that way what happens in reality is this
00:06:33.599 they pay $11,000 they make 10 they make
00:06:37.280 the extra nine and they say oh that
00:06:39.120 $11,000 was worth it this month and
00:06:41.240 guess what happens next
00:06:42.680 month you start at zero actually you
00:06:45.319 start at negative 1,000 because they've
00:06:47.680 already paid you a th000 and they
00:06:48.919 haven't made any money yet and so again
00:06:51.199 it's always going to be relative to when
00:06:53.000 they pay and what they get relative to
00:06:55.160 that and so this is where this
00:06:57.440 volatility ends up becoming a trap for
00:06:59.319 most business owners and when you're
00:07:01.080 starting a business or even when you're
00:07:02.400 a few years into the business you'll
00:07:03.919 often sell the people that you relate to
00:07:06.360 and so you'll sell out of your own
00:07:07.639 wallet to solve your own problems but
00:07:09.919 the problem there is that those people
00:07:12.919 will never become reliable it's like
00:07:14.759 building your business on a foundation
00:07:17.280 of sand it doesn't matter how beautiful
00:07:19.680 of a castle you can imagine in your mind
00:07:21.639 one bad storm on on a foundation of sand
00:07:24.039 and it's going to topple over and so you
00:07:25.639 end up just getting in this endless
00:07:26.919 cycle of trying to iterate your products
00:07:28.599 create different offers and all this
00:07:30.400 stuff but the fundamental issue is
00:07:31.680 you're serving somebody who's never
00:07:33.160 going to who's never going to stay in
00:07:34.759 pay because of them not you so for
00:07:37.120 example if you have a supplement
00:07:38.479 business it's unlikely that you're going
00:07:40.400 to get very high stick if you're super
00:07:42.879 expensive and your product Suite is only
00:07:46.360 geared towards beginners and beginners
00:07:48.680 turn out as in they go to the gym they
00:07:50.840 stop going to the gym they go to the gym
00:07:51.960 they stop going to the gym now if you
00:07:53.240 had a business that was geared around
00:07:54.720 the regular user or somebody who already
00:07:56.840 let's say takes protein every day and
00:07:58.560 you truly have a Superior product and
00:08:00.759 then that entire base of people who
00:08:02.080 takes protein shakes every day is
00:08:03.120 willing to take yours instead of someone
00:08:04.319 else's then you have a customer that is
00:08:06.720 already a qualified customer who's going
00:08:07.919 to continue to take the product over and
00:08:09.120 over again but when you target beginners
00:08:11.199 whether it's b2c or B2B obviously the
00:08:13.560 price differences are significant
00:08:15.159 between businesses and consumers but
00:08:16.879 they are still beginners within that
00:08:19.120 Continuum and so you will have the churn
00:08:21.759 in relation to how much of a beginner
00:08:23.919 they are and so my preferred way to
00:08:25.639 think about this is if you think about
00:08:27.360 this pyramid as representation of the
00:08:29.000 marketplace based on their spending
00:08:30.560 power right if you know at the base
00:08:32.360 you're always going to have the most
00:08:33.320 people that have the least amount of
00:08:34.399 money to spend and so whether it's B2B
00:08:36.519 or B Toc like b2c it's going to be base
00:08:38.640 beginners for whatever it is that you
00:08:39.958 sell if it's B2B it's going to be the
00:08:41.599 smallest business owners so it could be
00:08:43.240 you know consumers becoming prosumers or
00:08:45.560 prosumers becoming vnbs which is a very
00:08:47.519 small business and then vmbs becoming
00:08:49.080 smbs which is small business owners and
00:08:50.880 then and then you have low midm market
00:08:52.080 midmarket and then you all you go all
00:08:53.279 the way up to uh you know Fortune 100
00:08:54.680 companies right my preferred way to
00:08:56.320 structure a business model is to
00:08:57.880 actually start at the top and the reason
00:09:00.160 for this is that because there's little
00:09:01.680 operational drag because you have fewer
00:09:03.079 customers you need to take care of
00:09:04.360 they're able to spend significantly more
00:09:06.560 they are going to be around a while and
00:09:08.399 they know their numbers and they can
00:09:09.560 stick with their commitment so if you
00:09:10.680 have a contract for example and they say
00:09:12.480 they'll pay you a million dollars a year
00:09:13.480 the likely they pay you is significantly
00:09:15.000 higher then a beginner saying he's going
00:09:16.440 to pay you $10,000 over 10 months very
00:09:18.640 unlikely I would make that bet so much
00:09:20.959 so that corporate debt is an entire
00:09:23.000 investable asset class based on the
00:09:24.480 promises that business make to repay
00:09:25.920 things the cool part about this from a
00:09:27.240 branding perspective is that you learn
00:09:28.880 how to service SE much higher end
00:09:30.079 customers and with that reputation then
00:09:32.959 there are customers who are going to be
00:09:34.120 underneath who are then going to say you
00:09:36.160 know what I would love to be able to
00:09:37.519 work with somebody who works with the
00:09:38.920 400 I can't afford that you say you know
00:09:41.200 what I can make it a little bit more
00:09:42.240 affordable for you but you're going to
00:09:44.079 get a little bit less service for that
00:09:45.560 and you can work your way down now
00:09:46.920 here's where it gets really clever is
00:09:48.959 that as you work your way down you're
00:09:50.519 consistently making more money and at
00:09:52.200 this point when you go further and
00:09:53.880 further down this this Rabbit Hole
00:09:56.040 you're going to be able to spend the
00:09:58.279 money it takes to create the automated
00:10:01.000 solution or the software based or
00:10:03.279 technological based Solution that's
00:10:05.560 going to have a a near zero cost basis
00:10:08.320 for you as a business owner so that you
00:10:10.279 can profitably serve this itty bitty
00:10:13.000 these itty bitty dollar signs here
00:10:15.399 without the headache associated with
00:10:17.279 beginners fundamentally if you sell to
00:10:19.160 beginners you're going to have to either
00:10:20.519 sell a really big ticket one time that's
00:10:22.120 based on an emot emotional purchase and
00:10:24.320 you're doing what I would consider a
00:10:25.519 smash and grab business solar for
00:10:27.480 example is kind of what I would consider
00:10:28.800 a smash and and grab business people go
00:10:30.680 in they sell the they sell solar and
00:10:33.279 then it's on the roof and then that's
00:10:34.839 kind of it and so it's really just
00:10:36.560 massively just trying to sell every
00:10:37.760 single person that exists and that's all
00:10:39.760 there is to it or you have to create
00:10:41.680 something that's the price to Value
00:10:43.320 discrepancy is so absurd because what's
00:10:45.720 crazy about this is that the price to
00:10:47.040 value for poor people actually has to be
00:10:48.720 higher than it is for the people at the
00:10:51.000 top because here's the part here's the
00:10:53.480 part that people Miss think about this
00:10:55.200 there are people who cancel the $12 per
00:10:57.800 month Netflix charge like what else
00:11:00.600 could Netflix offer they give you like
00:11:02.360 every movie you could imagine every new
00:11:04.519 shows they do everything and still some
00:11:06.399 people are like you know I'm not really
00:11:07.519 sure if it's worth it for me right and
00:11:09.560 so if you take that as hypothetical
00:11:10.880 cream you can take the same thing for
00:11:12.160 for Spotify how how about I give you
00:11:14.200 every song that is possible in in the
00:11:16.440 universe you have access to it whenever
00:11:18.160 you want on your phone in your
00:11:20.639 pocket eight bucks is a lot eight bucks
00:11:23.320 is a lot for that right I don't know Mr
00:11:25.639 Spotify right and so this the thing is
00:11:28.079 is like I know many of you have these
00:11:29.880 businesses and are wondering looking at
00:11:31.240 yourself and like what more can I offer
00:11:32.920 it's not about you you have the wrong
00:11:34.480 model serving the wrong customer and so
00:11:36.320 you have to have a cost basis as low as
00:11:38.200 possible with a crazy high price to
00:11:40.560 Value discrepancy so so you know values
00:11:42.880 up here prices down here this huge Delta
00:11:45.920 so that even on their bad months they're
00:11:48.120 like you know what even though I lost my
00:11:50.480 job structural turn I'm still willing to
00:11:53.279 pay the 12 bucks for Netflix and so I
00:11:55.320 talk about this at length in the $100
00:11:57.560 million offers book and and I have this
00:12:00.040 really good visual that I want to show
00:12:01.360 you this is how crazy it is the thing
00:12:03.240 you sell doesn't even need to materially
00:12:05.519 change in order to make it ready and
00:12:07.560 available for the highest end customers
00:12:09.680 all right so let's say that you sell
00:12:11.760 time management all right and you sell
00:12:13.680 to all these people well you're going to
00:12:15.639 have to have a probably a $19 price
00:12:18.279 point see very Mass Market 19 bucks
00:12:21.320 maybe the next level is like okay well I
00:12:23.639 want to do time management for sales
00:12:25.320 professionals well for sales people
00:12:26.720 maybe You' be able to charge $99 okay
00:12:28.880 more because sales people were like all
00:12:30.079 right well you know one sale might pay
00:12:31.519 for this now what if you then go up to
00:12:34.920 time management for outbound B2B sales
00:12:37.199 so this isn't just people selling
00:12:38.440 memberships or car washes or cleaning
00:12:40.120 services this is now people selling
00:12:41.760 let's say enterprise software where
00:12:43.560 they're making $2,000 a sale in
00:12:45.920 commissions or whatever so for them to
00:12:47.720 pay $500 basically it's a quarter of one
00:12:50.160 sale so they're willing to do that now
00:12:52.800 let's go all the way up now we've got
00:12:54.600 time management for outbound B2B Power
00:12:56.360 Tools and Gardening sales reps so super
00:12:58.199 specific and high ticket you get super
00:13:00.399 niched down and you could sell it for
00:13:02.120 $2,000 but fundamentally time management
00:13:04.839 is time management and so the likelihood
00:13:06.800 that the product that you're selling is
00:13:08.040 really materially different between
00:13:09.839 these these these different avatars is
00:13:12.040 is is unlikely but we're choosing to
00:13:15.639 purposefully narrow down who we sell to
00:13:18.240 so that we can make more money and have
00:13:21.160 less operational drag and have less
00:13:24.160 structural churn as in people canceling
00:13:25.959 for reasons outside of what we've
00:13:27.639 delivered and as a result have a much
00:13:31.000 more stable business that can compound
00:13:33.040 year-over-year by the way I do have an
00:13:34.720 entire extra chapter on this that I
00:13:36.199 wrote between my offers book in my leads
00:13:37.920 book called uh your first Avatar and it
00:13:40.800 was kind of like a single that I
00:13:41.839 produced between the books uh I think
00:13:43.440 you get it for free at acquisition.
00:13:44.880 comom Avatar I think that's what it is
00:13:47.560 um and if not you probably Google it and
00:13:48.639 you'll probably find it but it's free
00:13:49.720 just pop in your email we'll tell you
00:13:51.040 and we'll send it over to you so step
00:13:53.199 two is to ask not tell your customers
00:13:56.959 now what do I mean by ask so I'll tell
00:13:59.440 you a quick story so Paul Graham said
00:14:01.160 this and I remember hearing it and it
00:14:02.680 just like got singed into my brain he
00:14:05.079 said you can solve every business
00:14:08.639 Problem by simply talking to your
00:14:11.160 customers and I thought that was such an
00:14:13.320 elegant answer and also true it's easy
00:14:16.199 to make a py response it's hard to make
00:14:18.399 it useful and valuable all the time and
00:14:20.720 this is one of those rare instances
00:14:22.040 where it's both and so I'll tell you a
00:14:23.720 story so when I had Allen which was our
00:14:26.399 software company which is the third
00:14:27.959 company that I started after 2016 I
00:14:29.880 originally made in my mind to serve gym
00:14:32.839 owners once we spent a million plus
00:14:35.519 dollars on developing this thing and
00:14:37.759 actually rolled it out to gym owners we
00:14:40.000 had this big obvious problem that came
00:14:42.440 up which is they said oh this is so
00:14:44.160 great this will work all my leads by the
00:14:46.240 way can you help me get more leads and I
00:14:48.480 was like oh no we completely missed the
00:14:50.720 mark and so what ended up happening is
00:14:52.519 that in my mind I could see that they
00:14:54.000 had this problem that they weren't
00:14:54.959 working their leads but what I didn't
00:14:56.720 realize is that there was only a very
00:14:58.240 specific amount of Custer customers that
00:14:59.480 had that problem and so then I had to
00:15:01.199 think oh gosh okay so I have two
00:15:02.839 possible scenarios I can either only go
00:15:05.199 after gym owners who already know how to
00:15:06.800 generate leads consistently which we're
00:15:08.600 talking like a tiny tiny tiny
00:15:11.199 Marketplace and and here's the caveat
00:15:13.560 that Marketplace still can't pay that
00:15:15.120 much so bad Market to go after small and
00:15:17.959 has not a lot of money and shrinking ye
00:15:20.720 right not a good market so I thought to
00:15:22.480 myself okay well what businesses always
00:15:25.880 have lead G well the solution came to me
00:15:29.560 when an agency owner actually reached
00:15:31.519 out to me and said hey could I use this
00:15:34.600 for my business to work the leads that
00:15:36.519 I'm generating for my small business
00:15:38.000 owner customers and I was like oh wait a
00:15:39.560 second small business owners will turn
00:15:41.319 in and out of the agency services but
00:15:43.360 the agency will stay because they will
00:15:45.920 bring new customers in use our software
00:15:49.000 and even if they turn out with them the
00:15:50.839 agency will stay with me and so the
00:15:52.480 agencies had much more reliable Revenue
00:15:54.920 than their base customers did because
00:15:57.079 they could reliably sell you know 10 new
00:15:59.319 customers a month to to offset the 10
00:16:01.199 customers they lose or whatever and so
00:16:02.839 many of them were still stable
00:16:03.920 businesses even though they had lots of
00:16:05.279 churn which the fact that they couldn't
00:16:07.279 necessarily have the skill set to grow
00:16:09.040 their business wasn't necessarily a
00:16:11.279 problem for me so to the same degree
00:16:12.959 with the CRM there are some crms that
00:16:15.120 are very successful even that serve
00:16:16.839 small business owners but they have to
00:16:18.560 match the pricing to the spending power
00:16:21.040 of that small business and Shopify for
00:16:23.920 example probably makes more than almost
00:16:25.920 any e-commerce company on the platform
00:16:27.880 we'd have to fact check it but is
00:16:29.079 probably pretty close and so the
00:16:30.800 platform itself actually makes more than
00:16:32.720 the opportunity Secrets it enables so
00:16:35.120 this is definitely one of those
00:16:36.040 situations of selling the shovels rather
00:16:37.959 than panning for gold and so once I
00:16:40.639 realized that gym owners were not the
00:16:42.880 customer and agencies were the customer
00:16:45.319 I was able to start asking agencies for
00:16:47.360 the correct feedback and that is when we
00:16:49.480 were able to continue to iterate the
00:16:51.240 product in a way that actually served
00:16:52.759 the right customer so fundamentally when
00:16:55.079 it comes to product or service based
00:16:58.040 businesses there's I would say two
00:17:01.160 schools of thought around product
00:17:03.240 iteration one is kind of
00:17:06.079 the rank and build model which is
00:17:11.679 basically you ask your customers to just
00:17:13.520 vote up vote and downvote the potential
00:17:16.439 things that all of them have asked for
00:17:18.079 and then the one that gets to the top
00:17:19.959 that month you then say this is the one
00:17:21.400 that we're going to build and then you
00:17:23.079 do the build cycle and then you ask it
00:17:24.720 again and this is not a bad way to do it
00:17:27.400 it's a different way to do it and what
00:17:28.919 ends up happening when you have a
00:17:30.039 business like this is that you keep
00:17:31.120 building more and more things and so
00:17:32.640 this can result in kind of these
00:17:34.640 Frankenstein type businesses but some
00:17:38.039 customers are okay and want to have all
00:17:40.640 the features and so this is kind of like
00:17:42.960 a PC versus MAC kind of product strategy
00:17:47.559 difference so the PCS is like you have
00:17:49.760 all the customization all the different
00:17:51.480 add-ons all the features that has all
00:17:53.320 these different ways you can use it but
00:17:55.799 can sometimes be more arduous in terms
00:17:57.880 of uxx or user experience user design
00:18:00.600 than a Mac now if you're like how does
00:18:02.240 this apply for a service business it's
00:18:03.640 literally the same it's just that the
00:18:05.400 features that you're building are going
00:18:06.520 to be around the services that you
00:18:07.919 provide rather than the actual physical
00:18:09.400 product or software that you're building
00:18:10.960 but it works the same way the Mac style
00:18:12.799 of this is trying to take every single
00:18:15.400 thing that people want right up and down
00:18:17.679 up and down and then trying to go from
00:18:20.120 the
00:18:21.480 ultimate experience at the end and then
00:18:23.880 reverse engineer it into a elegant
00:18:27.600 solution that purposely removes some
00:18:30.480 things because it interferes with the
00:18:33.280 other experiences and so when you do the
00:18:34.919 kind of rank and build model there's
00:18:36.760 lots of kind of conflicting
00:18:38.120 contingencies like different customers
00:18:40.120 want different things and some of the
00:18:41.360 things that you build for One customer
00:18:42.440 might actually impact negatively another
00:18:44.080 customer and so when you do that all of
00:18:46.240 a sudden you can lose now here the
00:18:49.320 downside is you're not going to be able
00:18:50.559 to serve all the needs of every customer
00:18:53.360 because some of those specific if you're
00:18:55.080 really specific about stuff then you
00:18:56.400 might want to have one of these
00:18:57.320 Solutions and so basically the customer
00:18:59.400 base that buys Mac stuff is
00:19:01.840 unsurprisingly different than the
00:19:03.320 customer base that buys PC stuff and so
00:19:05.360 for example at school our product
00:19:07.960 strategy is much more based on this
00:19:09.679 which is how do we create the most
00:19:11.200 elegant simplest solution so that we can
00:19:14.159 help people who are starting out build a
00:19:16.760 business online and so if we have all of
00:19:19.000 this customization and things like that
00:19:20.679 you might serve somebody who's like I
00:19:22.280 want a white label I want to whatever
00:19:24.520 right now to be clear these businesses
00:19:26.640 can obviously still get wildly big and
00:19:28.960 successful apple is a $3.8 trillion
00:19:32.240 company Amazon which also kind of
00:19:34.360 follows this model is a you know also
00:19:36.360 trillion doll plus business and so there
00:19:39.120 are different strategies that you need
00:19:40.760 to decide which one you want to pursue
00:19:43.080 but both of them work you just can't do
00:19:45.600 both so there's two questions that I
00:19:47.400 fundamentally like to ask when I'm
00:19:49.039 trying to go through this product
00:19:50.360 iteration cycle so the first one is if
00:19:52.840 there was only one thing that was left
00:19:55.760 after I deleted every other component of
00:19:57.840 my service product what one thing would
00:20:00.440 you want me to keep the second version
00:20:02.000 of that question is the equal opposite
00:20:04.240 if I kept everything except for one
00:20:06.360 thing what thing would you not care at
00:20:08.720 all about and then you delete that thing
00:20:12.480 and you see who complains and to be
00:20:14.760 clear you don't announce that you delete
00:20:16.000 it you just delete it and then see what
00:20:17.360 happens and then if you get complaints
00:20:19.000 you ask yourself the question are these
00:20:20.760 the types of customers that I want to
00:20:21.960 keep because sometimes the people who
00:20:23.320 complain are the ones that you don't
00:20:24.200 want in which case win-win for more info
00:20:27.120 on this I cover this at length in the
00:20:28.960 referral section of $100 million leads
00:20:31.080 and so in the referral section I talk
00:20:32.880 about how do you get more people better
00:20:34.440 results so this is fundamentally product
00:20:35.880 iteration and so the idea here is how do
00:20:37.760 we increase the perceived likelihood of
00:20:39.159 achievement the process that I like to
00:20:40.799 follow here so I have our action steps
00:20:42.640 right so you survey customers to find
00:20:44.720 the ones who get the best results step
00:20:46.360 one step two is you interview them to
00:20:48.520 find out what they did differently all
00:20:50.720 right so this is a behavior thing so on
00:20:52.720 one level you want to look at
00:20:53.480 demographics do they look different the
00:20:55.480 second is do they have a different user
00:20:56.840 path do they come in a different way do
00:20:58.240 they have a different promise number
00:20:59.720 three and this is the one that we're
00:21:00.720 referencing here is did they take
00:21:02.159 actions that not everyone necessarily
00:21:03.600 took we look at those actions that only
00:21:05.640 those people had in common and then what
00:21:07.720 we do is we take those actions and we
00:21:09.360 force new customers to repeat those
00:21:11.120 actions on purpose that the best
00:21:13.159 customers did by accident and then we
00:21:15.360 measure the Improvement of the average
00:21:16.679 customer based on those new behaviors
00:21:18.960 that we're incentivizing them towards or
00:21:20.520 at least pushing them towards and then
00:21:23.080 what we do if you want to get really
00:21:24.440 fancy with it is you can match the
00:21:26.159 conditions of your guarantee to the
00:21:27.360 actions that get the best results to get
00:21:28.840 more people to do them said differently
00:21:31.200 if you realize that the best customers
00:21:33.720 for example import all of their contacts
00:21:35.559 into your CRM when you're starting the
00:21:37.120 CRM you would then try and create the
00:21:39.000 onboarding experience and a guarantee
00:21:40.960 says hey we will guarantee that you'll
00:21:43.039 have some improvement using our software
00:21:45.080 service product as long as you export
00:21:48.679 and import all of your contacts into our
00:21:50.600 CRM within the first 30 days and so now
00:21:53.320 we have shown our hand to say this is
00:21:55.440 very valuable to us and it will be
00:21:57.320 valuable to you this app
00:21:59.440 process can fix any Department that's
00:22:02.760 customer facing obviously it can't fix
00:22:04.360 it but it can fix marketing so if all of
00:22:07.159 a sudden your ads aren't doing well show
00:22:09.080 your ads to customers and ask them
00:22:11.000 what's missing or what's what's not
00:22:13.320 working why would they not respond to
00:22:14.799 this what ads did you find that
00:22:16.919 resonated the most with you because I
00:22:18.159 want more people like you product you're
00:22:20.240 say okay what's wrong with this picture
00:22:22.320 what show me what's difficult watch
00:22:24.360 users actually interface with your
00:22:26.400 product or services so that you can
00:22:28.279 understand the friction points before
00:22:29.840 during and after and so I like to use
00:22:31.360 the three term contingency of before
00:22:32.720 during after to think through any kind
00:22:34.840 of change that I have for a customer
00:22:37.039 what's going to happen immediately
00:22:38.000 before they buy my product what's going
00:22:39.159 to happen immediately before they use my
00:22:40.559 product what's going to happen during
00:22:42.400 the time that they use the product like
00:22:43.679 what are the interactions they have and
00:22:44.679 then what happens immediately after
00:22:45.919 right and those are the places that we
00:22:47.039 are have the closest and strongest
00:22:48.480 leverage over the ultimate customer
00:22:50.360 results and the value that we provide
00:22:52.200 and same thing with sales like if people
00:22:53.640 are getting on the sales calls and
00:22:54.799 they're not buying then you ask
00:22:56.200 customers what about my offer what about
00:22:57.720 the way that we're presenting it is not
00:22:59.360 compelling to you and just as valuable
00:23:01.240 sometimes more if you can get them is
00:23:02.760 interviewing the people who said no and
00:23:04.279 say why not one of the best things you
00:23:05.760 can do is just pay them like I'll pay
00:23:06.960 $100 to hop on a phone call with me and
00:23:08.440 just tell me what we could have done
00:23:10.039 better and you know what's crazy is that
00:23:11.279 a lot of times you just even doing that
00:23:12.960 does give you a second shot at the sale
00:23:14.240 which is by no means the uh objective
00:23:17.279 you just want to get the information
00:23:18.360 because that information is so much more
00:23:20.120 valuable than the $100 and maybe the
00:23:21.600 hour that you'd give so number one once
00:23:24.039 we've picked the right customers who
00:23:26.640 aren't going to have structural turn
00:23:28.120 based the business model that we have
00:23:29.799 two we have the the thing that that type
00:23:32.480 of customer wants well we need to keep
00:23:34.000 improving that product so we don't get
00:23:35.640 outcompeted in the marketplace by new
00:23:37.559 entrance or new businesses who are
00:23:39.120 trying to take our slice of the pie the
00:23:41.080 third thing that we have to do to make
00:23:42.600 your business Unstoppable is don't
00:23:44.640 pretend to be something you're not and
00:23:46.320 you're like what does that even mean so
00:23:48.159 let me tell you this quote that I love
00:23:49.279 and then I'll get in the story this is
00:23:50.320 by Shane Parish success comes down to
00:23:52.799 doing the obvious thing for an
00:23:54.240 extraordinary period of time without
00:23:55.720 convincing yourself that you're smarter
00:23:57.080 than you actually are and I love this
00:23:58.919 quote for a number of reasons first off
00:24:00.279 because it's so true here's my easiest
00:24:02.320 visual for you actually I'm going see if
00:24:04.039 I can get the right right colors for the
00:24:05.400 markers so this is going to be a tough
00:24:07.679 one let's see if I can do draw this I've
00:24:09.360 never drawn this before so forgive me if
00:24:13.240 this
00:24:23.120 sucks oops that
00:24:26.399 up looks like a dog with a cly Q so this
00:24:29.559 is a
00:24:31.559 pig not a dog and
00:24:35.120 so and so here's the saying that I love
00:24:38.399 about this oh it's cuz I put a dog nose
00:24:40.000 on it I should have put I should have
00:24:41.120 put little little little front snout
00:24:43.880 okay well whatever you get the idea so
00:24:45.799 if you put lipstick on a
00:24:50.640 pig it's still a pig and so if you put a
00:24:53.640 little bit you sprinkle a little bit of
00:24:54.960 software into your service business it's
00:24:57.200 still a service business right and so if
00:24:58.960 like 90% of your Revenue comes from
00:25:00.480 service and here's the here's the tricky
00:25:01.880 part if 90% of the value comes from the
00:25:04.039 service they will still determine that
00:25:06.120 it's a service-based business and
00:25:08.279 arguably the likelihood that you will
00:25:10.840 get the economics that a software
00:25:13.640 company has with the service business is
00:25:16.039 low let me tell you a story to
00:25:17.320 illustrate the point so there was a
00:25:19.200 Solar Company that I was talking to that
00:25:20.559 had 400 sales guys so a big Solar
00:25:22.640 Company that did very well and the
00:25:24.520 founders uh were young enterprising guys
00:25:27.039 super ambitious they came to me and said
00:25:29.399 hey we want to have a monstrous
00:25:31.240 valuation for my for our company and I
00:25:32.880 said I think you already do have a
00:25:34.039 monstrous valuation for your company
00:25:35.320 they said well we know that software
00:25:37.200 companies get valued significantly
00:25:38.640 higher than kind of the transactional
00:25:40.720 sales nature of solar and I said you're
00:25:43.000 right and so what and so they were like
00:25:45.799 well we have this software that we have
00:25:48.080 that we use to recruit salespeople and
00:25:50.960 make them more productive and that's why
00:25:52.279 we have such a big and productive sales
00:25:53.760 team and so we were thinking about was
00:25:56.039 taking that software and then licensing
00:25:57.600 it to other solar companies and I told
00:26:01.039 them that I thought that was a terrible
00:26:02.360 idea now why would I say something like
00:26:04.240 that well in theory if you had a
00:26:06.679 software company that had the same
00:26:08.600 Revenue metrics as your solar sales
00:26:11.440 company then you would have a
00:26:12.840 significantly more valuable company but
00:26:14.480 number one is for you to get those same
00:26:16.880 economics you're not selling $30,000
00:26:19.159 things the likelihood that you'd be able
00:26:20.440 to get even close to the amount of
00:26:21.399 Revenue per customer would be
00:26:22.399 significantly lower number two is the
00:26:24.200 amount of people that can buy solar
00:26:25.520 roofs versus the amount of solar
00:26:26.880 companies is way smaller third neither
00:26:30.159 of these Founders were software people
00:26:32.039 and so what they wanted to do was kind
00:26:33.440 of like pretend to be software and just
00:26:35.799 say like oh we'll just sell some people
00:26:37.120 into this thing and then we're going to
00:26:38.279 get a software multiple on the entirety
00:26:39.760 of our Revenue that's not how it works
00:26:41.799 you have to remember that the person
00:26:43.799 who's writing a 100 200 500 billion
00:26:46.159 dollar check is smart enough to have a
00:26:48.760 1002 200 or a billion dollars to spend
00:26:51.399 they know the difference between a Solar
00:26:52.880 Company and a software company software
00:26:55.360 companies and companies that get
00:26:57.080 extraordinarily High multiples
00:26:59.000 don't get high multiples because of the
00:27:01.159 name or the label that's associated with
00:27:03.120 them they get those extraordinarily High
00:27:05.120 multiples because of the nature of the
00:27:07.799 revenue and the quality of the revenue
00:27:09.760 that they have and the potential for
00:27:11.080 gross profit in the future and so if you
00:27:13.320 have a service based business that has
00:27:15.480 the exact same economics as a software
00:27:17.559 company you will get software like
00:27:20.840 multiples and Enterprise Value you want
00:27:22.640 to solve for the things that matter
00:27:24.679 which is you want to solve for Revenue
00:27:26.159 retention you want to solve for
00:27:27.240 incremental margin you want to solve for
00:27:29.200 logo retention over meaning number of
00:27:30.880 businesses that are staying on on your
00:27:32.320 platform or on your inside of your
00:27:33.840 business you want to solve for being
00:27:35.720 able to onboard low value people to be
00:27:38.960 able to provide high value Services
00:27:41.159 right so this is where like a tech
00:27:42.279 enabled service can be more valuable
00:27:45.240 than a traditional service because a
00:27:46.840 tech enabled service might be able to
00:27:48.399 take one person and have them serve 50
00:27:50.200 customers rather than one person and
00:27:51.480 have them serve five but it's not
00:27:52.840 because it's Tech enabled it's because
00:27:54.919 you have now 10x the value that any
00:27:58.320 individual employee can provide and
00:28:01.399 lower the skill barrier for somebody to
00:28:03.799 provide that value and so that
00:28:05.640 translates into higher gross margins
00:28:08.320 lower cost of acquiring talent and
00:28:10.360 higher percentage of customers that stay
00:28:11.840 every year which means that the business
00:28:12.960 will compound year over year every year
00:28:14.600 and so you can wash away all of the
00:28:17.559 labels that people ascribe to business
00:28:19.760 and simply boil it down to the metrics
00:28:21.720 and the unit economics of the business
00:28:23.919 to then ascertain fancy word figure out
00:28:27.399 what the Enterprise value multiple of
00:28:28.799 the businesses because it's only going
00:28:30.640 to be a discount off of how big and How
00:28:33.760 likely that bigness is to occur in the
00:28:35.840 future for an investor a lot of small
00:28:38.240 business owners entrepreneurs want to
00:28:39.720 get the maximum amount of money for
00:28:41.360 their business in the future and that
00:28:42.600 makes sense you should do that but the
00:28:43.880 way you do that is not by trying to
00:28:45.559 pretend to be a different type of
00:28:46.760 business it's not by taking your you
00:28:48.919 know lawn care business and trying to
00:28:50.200 say actually we're a s we're a software
00:28:51.960 business is not trying to take your
00:28:53.360 e-commerce business and saying actually
00:28:54.840 we're a platform it doesn't work that
00:28:56.880 way it all boils down to the actual math
00:28:59.760 and so the easiest analogy is if you
00:29:01.279 think about your business as a pig and
00:29:03.399 this is the world's ugliest pig if you
00:29:05.080 put lipstick on the pig it's still a pig
00:29:07.519 and so if you put lipstick or you
00:29:09.240 sprinkle some software on your lawn care
00:29:11.000 business or your local service business
00:29:12.559 it's still a local service business and
00:29:14.519 one of the mistakes that I honestly see
00:29:16.519 all the time is where people will take
00:29:18.679 their service say I'll give you the
00:29:20.480 service for free if you use the software
00:29:22.840 but here's the problem the revenue will
00:29:25.720 look just like service Revenue
00:29:28.600 and so just because you Bill through a
00:29:30.679 software system if you still have the
00:29:32.600 same churn as a service business and the
00:29:35.039 same margins as a service business then
00:29:37.159 they will still value you like a service
00:29:38.840 business you'll get valued based on a
00:29:40.960 multiple of bottom line which is fine
00:29:42.919 it's just not going to be a Top Line
00:29:44.320 multiple or some big number on top of
00:29:46.159 that because that's not the nature of
00:29:47.880 the business you're in and that's okay
00:29:50.159 so I think just leaning into who you are
00:29:53.120 and what your business really is rather
00:29:55.320 than wasting a tremendous amount of time
00:29:57.000 trying to be something you're not not
00:29:58.399 would serve a huge percentage of
00:29:59.960 business owners they think because the
00:30:01.600 grass is greener on the software side
00:30:03.279 man they're getting 10x value multiples
00:30:05.799 well do you know how hard it is to get
00:30:07.760 80% of people to stick on a software and
00:30:11.600 do it in a way where you're making that
00:30:13.600 kind of money but it's but it's at $50 a
00:30:15.919 month instead of $5,000 a month well
00:30:18.360 they kind in some ways it's like they
00:30:19.960 kind of deserve it right like all of a
00:30:22.440 sudden it's like it's really hard to get
00:30:24.559 5,000 customers to pay $1,000 a month
00:30:27.320 for B2B software really tough but is it
00:30:30.799 is it is it nearly as hard to do some
00:30:32.720 sort of service at that level probably
00:30:35.080 not and so when we think about it from
00:30:37.039 that perspective the differences between
00:30:39.360 valuations actually equalize I'll tell
00:30:41.080 you one more story on this so I recently
00:30:42.760 invested in a treatment center and we
00:30:44.519 were talking about uh the business model
00:30:47.080 and so basically there's two there's
00:30:49.679 more permutations but this said simply
00:30:51.720 there's two kind of models in the
00:30:52.799 treatment world so model one is you
00:30:55.159 stick with primarily insurance and you
00:30:57.720 get people to you know the insurance
00:31:00.080 companies send you people who need to
00:31:01.399 you know come off addictions detox Etc
00:31:03.480 and you get paid a fix kind of rate per
00:31:05.000 day based on the insurance that the
00:31:06.559 person comes in with the second type of
00:31:07.880 company is more you know private
00:31:09.960 insurance and cash pay where people are
00:31:11.919 just paying out of pocket or they're
00:31:13.279 paying with you know I would say premium
00:31:14.960 insurances where they could pay
00:31:16.200 somewhere in the neighborhood of like
00:31:17.200 $3,000 a day so way more money per day
00:31:20.799 than maybe the uh insurance-based uh
00:31:23.360 detox business for example now which
00:31:26.360 business do you think gets higher
00:31:27.480 multiples the insurance-based one
00:31:29.399 because the likel that the insurance
00:31:30.639 pays is high and the likel that you're
00:31:32.039 going to keep getting customers from
00:31:33.000 those insurance or Medicare companies
00:31:34.279 things like that is high and so it
00:31:36.600 becomes a reliable business but the
00:31:38.440 margins are lower and you have to deal
00:31:40.279 with more volume now on the alternative
00:31:42.000 side on the cash Bas side you might have
00:31:43.679 call it half the Enterprise multiple
00:31:45.240 value so instead of getting a 10x maybe
00:31:46.639 get a five or 6X on the value of the
00:31:48.559 business in terms of bottom line but if
00:31:50.080 you can charge two or three times more
00:31:52.000 return on effort might actually be the
00:31:53.519 same or even better in the cash pay I
00:31:55.360 make this point to say you don't want to
00:31:56.919 try and build for some label that you
00:31:59.320 think someone's going to ascribe to you
00:32:01.399 you just want to build for the ultimate
00:32:03.159 Enterprise Value which may just be doing
00:32:06.399 better with the thing you have which is
00:32:08.600 mo more times than not the right move
00:32:11.559 which is why I'll resay this quote that
00:32:13.120 I said at the beginning which is Success
00:32:15.200 comes down to doing the obvious thing
00:32:17.240 continuing to build your business for an
00:32:19.000 extraordinary period of time much longer
00:32:20.639 than you think without convincing
00:32:22.240 yourself that you're smarter than you
00:32:23.240 are without actually changing the label
00:32:24.679 of your business trying to pretend to be
00:32:25.760 a software company trying to pretend to
00:32:26.960 be a platform trying to pretend tend to
00:32:28.080 be Tech enabled just do what you do and
00:32:30.320 do it well and do it for a long time and
00:32:32.799 it always takes longer costs more and
00:32:35.200 it's harder than you expected to be but
00:32:37.159 it's the expectation that was the
00:32:38.480 problem not your plan so now that we
00:32:40.159 have the base we have the right
00:32:42.000 customers for the model that we're in we
00:32:43.880 have a way to iterate our products that
00:32:45.399 we stay ahead of the market and we have
00:32:47.399 the discipline to continue to double
00:32:49.240 down on the model we have rather than
00:32:50.600 try and ascribe some crazy label make
00:32:52.519 some reinvestments into things that
00:32:54.039 aren't going to actually serve us once
00:32:55.919 we have that base then you can watch
00:32:58.399 this next video how to make so much
00:32:59.440 money it should feel legal
