# 13 Years of No BS Business Advice for 2025
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/cnbHgYYHzyE

00:00:00.080 I've been in business for 13 years and
00:00:01.760 since 2020 three of the companies I
00:00:03.240 started have reached $100 million plus
00:00:04.839 valuation here's nobas advice to help
00:00:06.919 you crush 2025 my first piece of advice
00:00:10.080 is set fewer goals and do less long-term
00:00:14.240 planning hear me out and so this may
00:00:15.879 sound contradictory to some of my
00:00:17.760 content about being patient and I think
00:00:19.320 long-term goals are very important but
00:00:21.640 the obsession over the minutia of how
00:00:24.119 you're going to get there is I believe
00:00:26.560 an act of mental masturbation you try
00:00:29.080 and create these massive projections
00:00:30.920 that are based on hundreds of variables
00:00:32.960 that in reality you just don't know
00:00:34.760 what's going to happen and so over time
00:00:37.399 I've consistantly trimmed and trimmed
00:00:39.719 and trimmed our planning processes such
00:00:41.879 that at this point I pretty much only
00:00:43.879 care what we're going to do in the next
00:00:45.039 12 weeks and beyond that we might have
00:00:47.600 one target or two Targets by the end of
00:00:49.360 the year but we're not going to dedicate
00:00:50.920 a lot of resources to this and this is
00:00:52.359 somebody who's coming who who's a big
00:00:54.160 fan of preparation but I've just found
00:00:56.000 that it ended up being a huge waste of
00:00:57.879 time mostly because whenever I looked at
00:01:00.120 the plans that I made the year before
00:01:01.920 one year later I was like man half this
00:01:03.719 stuff isn't even relevant anymore
00:01:05.319 because of new changes and conditions
00:01:07.479 and so I will probably continue to lean
00:01:10.200 more in this direction and I think this
00:01:11.520 has become a little bit more popularized
00:01:13.560 by some of the CEOs like Jensen hang who
00:01:15.680 despite having Nvidia over 30 plus years
00:01:18.080 has recently talked about how he
00:01:19.520 basically doesn't do a lot of long-term
00:01:21.159 planning because fundamentally you have
00:01:23.280 things that you can do today and those
00:01:25.560 are the things you begin to allocate now
00:01:27.960 sometimes do what you need to do today
00:01:29.400 is work for something that's going to
00:01:30.759 happen in the future but you can only
00:01:31.920 control what you do today and so I have
00:01:33.640 shifted more and more in terms of what
00:01:35.720 will this change about our Behavior and
00:01:37.399 the rest of it I more or less toss out
00:01:39.520 so let me give you a couple visuals to
00:01:41.159 make this real and so the first thing is
00:01:44.200 that we think that you're going to have
00:01:46.119 this really neat line of how the growth
00:01:49.159 is going to happen right but reality is
00:01:51.680 very messy and so what's likely going to
00:01:54.840 happen is that you will Flatline and
00:01:56.799 then figure something out and then
00:01:58.000 you'll Flatline and then figure
00:01:59.280 something out and Flatline to figure
00:02:00.799 something out this is what it looks like
00:02:02.479 if you were to zoom in on this little
00:02:05.119 area here right if you were to zoom in
00:02:06.799 here it actually looks closer to what
00:02:08.360 this is which is you have the stagnation
00:02:10.399 and then you have these improvements
00:02:11.640 that occur and then increase Revenue now
00:02:14.200 one of the things that's also shifted my
00:02:16.599 perspective on how to plan is let's say
00:02:19.959 that we've got thing a thing B thing C
00:02:22.840 thing D thing e that we need to do well
00:02:26.400 before this I would try and you know
00:02:28.640 divers you know delegate each of these
00:02:31.160 things to person one person two person
00:02:32.959 three person four person five and so on
00:02:36.000 but I would say that that appears to me
00:02:39.319 like I have not done my job because I
00:02:41.560 need to do a better job prioritizing one
00:02:44.239 of these things is the most important
00:02:46.800 and if you can't decide what that is
00:02:48.680 then you are not doing your job and you
00:02:50.680 certainly can't expect your team to make
00:02:52.640 that decision for you and so I've had to
00:02:54.480 look at this and say if I could only
00:02:56.239 pick one of these things and we only
00:02:58.879 accomplish that thing
00:03:00.400 which of these would get us closer to
00:03:02.360 our vision for what the company should
00:03:04.000 be which ones would move us the furthest
00:03:06.040 forward which of these is the biggest
00:03:08.000 domino and so what I've redone is I say
00:03:11.400 Okay a is actually the priority I don't
00:03:14.760 need to order B through C here I don't
00:03:17.400 need to worry about what order these are
00:03:19.080 in and then I will take 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
00:03:24.040 plus 5 and get all of these resources
00:03:27.280 concentrated on solving a and then what
00:03:30.280 I found is that once you solve a with
00:03:32.439 all those resources because everyone's
00:03:34.360 aligned then all of a sudden B happens
00:03:36.840 faster C happens faster D happens faster
00:03:39.159 than trying to do them all at once so
00:03:41.480 let's say that you ran an agency right
00:03:43.760 so you do meta ads for small businesses
00:03:46.760 like a very typical business so if that
00:03:49.439 was your business you might say okay we
00:03:51.680 need to you know get more
00:03:53.720 leads so that means we're going to
00:03:55.680 increase ads okay that's one of the
00:03:57.720 things we're going to you know increase
00:03:59.280 show rate because our show up rate sucks
00:04:01.439 so we're going to we're going to try and
00:04:02.799 fix that we've got a hire you know a
00:04:04.959 sales manager and whatever else right
00:04:07.360 like you've got you've got you've got
00:04:08.519 your tasks I'll just put dot dot dot dot
00:04:10.079 dot dot now if this was your objective a
00:04:13.400 good strategist says given the resources
00:04:15.640 I currently have what one thing could I
00:04:18.358 do that would make all of these problems
00:04:21.600 disappear the good strategist would
00:04:23.400 would then say well if I had a brand and
00:04:26.600 I invested in my brand well would that
00:04:29.280 would that accomplish my leads thing yep
00:04:31.600 now I wouldn't have ads but it would
00:04:32.840 accomplish my problem with getting leads
00:04:34.520 now would show up rates be higher if I
00:04:36.479 have a warm audience yes would my close
00:04:39.600 rate be okay because everyone is being
00:04:41.479 warmer probably now you might have to
00:04:43.440 still hire the sales manager you can see
00:04:45.479 how the entire Dynamic would change if
00:04:48.120 only this were true and so then it
00:04:50.639 follows okay well what are the resources
00:04:53.120 required to make this happen and if I
00:04:56.039 know what those resources are and I have
00:04:57.960 those resources available then it would
00:05:00.080 follow that I should do this one thing
00:05:02.320 and then in so doing accomplish all of
00:05:04.759 these other things as a consequence and
00:05:08.080 this is why to be clear if you're like
00:05:10.080 wait well they're just going to say
00:05:11.800 build a better product because if you
00:05:13.680 have a good product you're not going to
00:05:14.880 lose people you're going to get word of
00:05:16.120 mouth you're going to have higher LTV or
00:05:18.400 they're just going to say you know Alex
00:05:19.880 is just going to say build a good brand
00:05:21.120 because if you build a good brand then
00:05:22.080 all these other problems go away no
00:05:25.800 that's called Leverage and so you're
00:05:27.919 like no no no I don't want to do the one
00:05:29.840 thing that would solve all my problems I
00:05:32.800 want to try and solve each of my
00:05:34.319 problems individually well that's
00:05:36.479 amazing for you and you should probably
00:05:37.840 get that looked at but the point is is
00:05:40.600 that a good strategist has to look at
00:05:43.520 all available options given the
00:05:45.160 resources they have and say which one of
00:05:47.240 these gets me the most and fundamentally
00:05:49.479 that is leverage next up is the
00:05:52.600 strongest force in all of business and
00:05:55.120 so I believe in this so thoroughly that
00:05:57.960 there are only two concepts that are
00:06:00.440 embedded within the acquisition. comom
00:06:02.440 logo the first is this cross here which
00:06:06.199 is the supply and demand curve that
00:06:08.599 exists in any Market the second part is
00:06:11.280 why is this a triangle the triangle is
00:06:13.199 there to exist as a full crumb for
00:06:14.960 leverage and so fundamentally if you can
00:06:18.599 have a supply demand curve that is
00:06:20.800 dramatically in your favor that alone
00:06:24.000 will dictate this if you are the only
00:06:25.680 person who sells this one thing and the
00:06:27.280 entire world wants it you going to make
00:06:29.080 a lot of money money pretty much no
00:06:31.080 matter what doesn't matter how good you
00:06:32.360 are at Market doesn't matter how good
00:06:33.440 you are at sales doesn't matter how good
00:06:34.759 you are at pricing you're going to make
00:06:36.319 a ton of money and so I try to think
00:06:38.400 what are the fewest things that have to
00:06:40.080 be true in order for me to win and I
00:06:42.319 would rather just get those things right
00:06:44.520 and then everything else can fall away
00:06:46.680 and so think about this in sequence
00:06:48.479 Supply demand is the first and most
00:06:50.400 important thing as long as we have those
00:06:52.360 things then if you had that hypothetical
00:06:54.880 example of the entire world wants
00:06:56.080 something and you're the only one who
00:06:57.000 does it what's the next thing you would
00:06:58.560 need which is Leever
00:07:00.039 you would want to be able to get as much
00:07:01.840 for the effort that you put in because
00:07:03.400 you would get bottlenecked based on
00:07:05.960 maybe your supply chain you'd have other
00:07:07.759 dependencies that would prevent you from
00:07:09.479 capitalizing on the opportunity that the
00:07:11.639 supply and demand curve has put in front
00:07:13.840 of you and so in a perfect world you
00:07:16.000 have all of that and unlimited leverage
00:07:18.479 and that allows you to maximally
00:07:20.680 capitalize on opportunities and that is
00:07:22.840 why I designed the acquisition. comom
00:07:24.599 logo to exhibit those things now the
00:07:28.240 first piece here is understanding
00:07:29.879 whether your business is Supply or
00:07:31.280 demand constrained and so a supply
00:07:33.800 constrained business for example is one
00:07:36.440 that's like cleaning like cleaners often
00:07:38.720 don't have a hard time finding other
00:07:41.319 businesses or other homes to do cleaning
00:07:44.199 for a lot of people just don't want to
00:07:45.479 do it the issue they have is finding
00:07:48.400 staff who can do the cleaning with them
00:07:50.680 or for them so that means that your
00:07:52.639 supply side of how you can deliver to
00:07:55.479 the demand is usually the issue and this
00:07:58.039 happens a lot of times with I would
00:07:59.800 consider nuisance services so services
00:08:02.840 that people might know how to do but
00:08:04.440 just don't want to do a different
00:08:05.960 example of this in the professional
00:08:07.479 setting would be like accounting firms
00:08:09.599 accounting firms a lot of people don't
00:08:11.440 want to hire accountants and for a big
00:08:14.000 period of time in a lot of companies
00:08:15.479 growth in the beginning you don't have
00:08:17.039 in-house accounting and so having an out
00:08:19.240 ofh housee accountant there's plenty of
00:08:20.879 demand for them the issue they have is
00:08:22.960 recruiting really good accountants and
00:08:25.199 so yet again they are a supply
00:08:27.639 constrained business now this works
00:08:30.960 again with legal it works with high-end
00:08:33.159 Consulting like if you're a very good
00:08:34.640 consultant in a niche it's very like
00:08:36.640 easy to get people to want to buy from
00:08:38.039 you very hard to get other people to do
00:08:40.000 what you can do because you're really
00:08:41.320 good at this thing right and so this is
00:08:43.200 very typical in a lot of businesses
00:08:45.040 especially service and so that would be
00:08:48.200 Supply constrainted businesses and if
00:08:50.120 that is the constraint then what do we
00:08:52.240 do to gain leverage over the constraint
00:08:55.560 and so this is where okay is there a way
00:08:58.000 that we can build a community of
00:09:00.480 accountants that we can then recruit
00:09:02.320 from is there a way that we can create
00:09:04.399 some sort of environment that attracts
00:09:06.480 more cleaners can our compensation
00:09:08.240 structure can we have a referral system
00:09:10.560 internally for our team or our employees
00:09:12.920 because I know what a cleaner I know
00:09:14.640 what a legal person I know what another
00:09:16.560 consultant is worth to me to my business
00:09:18.920 in total gross profit per year and why
00:09:21.279 would I not be willing to pay 20% of
00:09:24.040 that to somebody now you might do that
00:09:26.160 math and be like holy cow I make 250,000
00:09:28.079 a year per new lawyer who joins my firm
00:09:30.880 it' probably be a lot more than that
00:09:31.800 honestly in that case then why would I
00:09:33.880 be unwilling to spend $50,000 to go and
00:09:37.920 not not only that give that $50,000 to
00:09:41.120 someone on my team for bringing another
00:09:43.040 great lawyer in and so this scales all
00:09:45.720 the way up and all the way down based on
00:09:47.279 the revenue that each of these high-end
00:09:49.440 or Supply constrained employees provides
00:09:52.000 the business now those are Supply
00:09:53.839 constraint businesses and if you're in
00:09:55.560 one of those you need to recognize it
00:09:57.079 because the real businesses you're in is
00:09:59.720 attracting hiring training managing and
00:10:03.480 incentivizing these people to perform
00:10:05.560 that's the real business because the
00:10:06.800 demand kind of takes care of itself of
00:10:08.720 course you have to do the basics but the
00:10:10.600 real issue is going to be on the back
00:10:11.880 end not the front end now let's flip the
00:10:14.160 tables there are some businesses that
00:10:16.240 are demand constrainted now demand
00:10:18.880 constrainted businesses will be
00:10:20.440 typically like e-commerce businesses
00:10:22.920 often times software businesses
00:10:25.120 specifically B2B software businesses can
00:10:27.720 be demand constrained typically iCal
00:10:29.560 consumer products weight loss for
00:10:31.680 example is a very demand constrain
00:10:33.640 business now this m sounds wild to you
00:10:35.320 like wait I think so many people want to
00:10:36.680 lose weight yeah there's just even more
00:10:39.040 people who Supply it and so many
00:10:41.720 different methods for doing it now again
00:10:43.920 all of these things can shift right
00:10:45.839 supply and demand is a curve like it can
00:10:47.600 move right this is dynamic and this
00:10:49.399 video exists in time and unfortunately
00:10:51.160 the environments change but anybody
00:10:53.120 who's been in Fitness would understand
00:10:55.440 that getting customers is actually
00:10:57.040 typically the hardest part finding train
00:10:59.279 ERS not that hard there's lots of people
00:11:02.040 that like training and they'll even do
00:11:03.680 it for free same thing with musicians
00:11:05.839 like if you teach music classes right
00:11:07.800 one of the difficulties there is
00:11:09.000 attracting people who want to buy music
00:11:10.959 lessons but there's tons of people who
00:11:12.360 play music and do it for free right and
00:11:14.440 so the idea is which side of this curve
00:11:16.839 are you on and then whatever that side
00:11:19.320 is is asking yourself how can I gain
00:11:21.399 more leverage over this problem so that
00:11:23.480 I can solve it at scale once and for all
00:11:25.959 rather than having to solve it
00:11:27.200 continuously over and over and over
00:11:29.360 again so I'll give you an example I had
00:11:30.839 a a company who came out that we were
00:11:32.320 looking at and they were a little bit on
00:11:35.079 the smaller side but they were a home
00:11:36.800 services company and so the issue they
00:11:39.120 had is they were struggling to attract
00:11:41.000 plumbers and so one of the things that
00:11:44.320 we put in place for the business was
00:11:46.560 well what does a plumber bring in every
00:11:47.959 year and let's call it $400,000 in gross
00:11:50.360 profit okay so if you have a nut of
00:11:53.680 $400,000 that you know you've got the
00:11:55.639 demand for they're turning away business
00:11:57.160 cuz their phones ringing too much and
00:11:58.399 they can't even take it what are you
00:11:59.839 willing to pay one time to unlock
00:12:03.480 $400,000 every year in gross profit well
00:12:06.760 if you were to think about that like an
00:12:08.079 investment right which would be like
00:12:09.880 okay I've got this stock that yields
00:12:12.360 $400,000 in gross profit per year to me
00:12:15.079 what would I be willing to pay for it
00:12:16.399 and that's every year well shoot I'd be
00:12:18.279 at least willing to pay $400,000 if it
00:12:20.320 was a stock right that's 100% return
00:12:22.320 because next year I'm going to make
00:12:23.040 $400,000 too now there is an element of
00:12:25.959 risk that comes into the equation what
00:12:27.560 if the person leaves what if they get
00:12:28.760 fired they're not good all of those
00:12:30.240 things so those are for sure there which
00:12:31.680 means that we would then apply some sort
00:12:33.040 of discount to account for that risk but
00:12:35.000 I think that one of the big
00:12:36.320 misconceptions that business owners have
00:12:38.040 is they're not willing to pay enough for
00:12:40.320 talent that is the constraint of their
00:12:41.920 business like right now if you could get
00:12:44.240 10 more like if you were in a supply
00:12:45.959 coning business if you could get 10 more
00:12:48.320 of not not star just appropriately
00:12:51.720 competent employees who could service
00:12:53.440 the demand that you have would that
00:12:56.040 double or triple your business if so yes
00:12:59.279 what would you pay in order to double
00:13:00.880 Tri your business probably a lot more
00:13:03.440 than it costs you to attract those
00:13:05.680 people cool then what do we do well the
00:13:08.440 easiest thing is incentivize all the
00:13:10.000 people in your existing Workforce to go
00:13:11.480 do that recruiting for you too many
00:13:13.079 business owners will give like a $1,000
00:13:15.199 referral bonus on something that makes
00:13:16.560 $400,000 a year in gross profit well
00:13:18.760 that's dumb if if I can give $25,000
00:13:21.720 away or $50,000 away and I can get it
00:13:24.360 solved in a month then every month
00:13:26.440 because that $400,000 doesn't happen at
00:13:27.880 once it happens over this period of time
00:13:30.040 and so if I can actually solve the
00:13:31.560 problem two months earlier then that
00:13:33.320 means I get get to collect $35,000 for
00:13:36.079 two more months of gross profit okay so
00:13:38.279 there is a Time component of this so
00:13:39.839 maybe you can get the referral and maybe
00:13:41.720 it does take you 6 months instead of
00:13:43.480 three but you missed out on whatever
00:13:45.560 that is $105,000 in gross profit that
00:13:48.120 you could have had had you just been
00:13:49.920 willing to pay a little bit more but
00:13:51.639 still less overall and you still get to
00:13:53.880 keep that person for life so you'll
00:13:55.480 notice that I'm talking a lot about who
00:13:57.240 in these examples and you know it's one
00:14:00.480 of those big obvious TR responses that
00:14:04.480 everyone who is a senior entrepreneur or
00:14:07.440 senior investor or Warren Buffett or
00:14:09.519 Steve Jobs they all say the same thing
00:14:12.000 it's just about the people right bet on
00:14:13.959 the jockey not the horse there's tons of
00:14:15.399 isms in this world and everyone nods
00:14:17.000 along but the problem is that people
00:14:18.639 don't have the context to understand the
00:14:20.720 levels of talent that exist and this is
00:14:22.560 why these mistakes are so hard to Bear
00:14:25.000 because you have to have some sort of
00:14:26.360 pattern recognition of having worked
00:14:28.240 with one terrible people to know how to
00:14:30.440 avoid them and then secondarily what
00:14:32.880 star Talent looks like and sometimes it
00:14:35.240 takes luck in the beginning and then
00:14:36.600 over time you start recognizing what
00:14:38.639 that looks like so that you can do it on
00:14:40.120 purpose rather than on accident and if
00:14:41.639 you think about people as one of the
00:14:42.920 highest leverage things you can do so
00:14:44.880 think about this as hypothetical if your
00:14:46.720 business had people who could do
00:14:48.519 everything that currently exists and you
00:14:50.199 could simply own it that would mean that
00:14:51.639 you could work zero and make almost the
00:14:53.320 same amount that you do now you'd only
00:14:55.000 have to find someone who could do what
00:14:56.160 you do like literally just think about
00:14:57.480 what you currently make think about what
00:15:00.040 you currently do if you could pay
00:15:02.120 someone less than what you currently
00:15:03.560 make in distributions to do 100% of what
00:15:05.480 you currently do you could feasibly
00:15:07.240 retire at your current income level just
00:15:09.600 with that one Higher the idea of getting
00:15:12.199 really good people is still undervalued
00:15:14.440 in the marketplace which is why there's
00:15:15.920 always an opportunity for people who
00:15:17.880 know how to attract and retain the best
00:15:20.680 talent there's a reason that the most
00:15:22.560 expensive companies in the world in the
00:15:23.920 stock market are at War for talent I
00:15:26.519 want to say like 18 months ago one of
00:15:27.800 the headlines of I think like the New
00:15:29.079 York Times or something was the talent
00:15:30.480 War and the whole idea was just that
00:15:33.360 it's an onslaught of signing bonuses and
00:15:35.720 Kumbaya and free lunch and all this
00:15:37.440 stuff to try and attract the top talent
00:15:40.120 because they know that the leverage of
00:15:43.160 having somebody who's a 10x engineer or
00:15:45.839 a 100x marketer for their business is
00:15:48.360 always worth more than what they're
00:15:50.120 going to pay the individual and so
00:15:51.720 they're just doing everything they can
00:15:53.319 to get them and this is me trying to
00:15:54.759 translate that to you in terms of my
00:15:56.319 emphasis over the last year or years
00:15:58.399 that has yielded this outcome if we're
00:16:00.399 thinking about more or less in terms of
00:16:01.800 my focus this is one that I'm doing more
00:16:03.880 of I'm more focused on Talent I'm more
00:16:06.319 focused on better people fewer better
00:16:08.279 people and incentivizing them and
00:16:10.279 incentivizing other people to bring them
00:16:11.759 in there's some semiconductor companies
00:16:13.880 that are offering 3x salaries their
00:16:16.160 current salary to poach people from one
00:16:17.800 company to another because the cost of
00:16:19.240 switching is obviously high and so if
00:16:21.399 they're making more money than you you
00:16:23.040 should look at what they're doing so
00:16:24.720 next point up for me is of the first 100
00:16:26.639 days this year I took zero days off
00:16:29.440 and I bring this up because this is a
00:16:31.120 very taboo topic and I want to be clear
00:16:33.040 do whatever you want I'm just saying
00:16:34.680 that when I see the entrepreneurs who
00:16:36.880 were obsessed with their work they do
00:16:39.920 better than people who aren't and it's
00:16:42.079 basically that their discretionary time
00:16:43.759 that would go to hobbies that would go
00:16:45.720 to other things basically all flows into
00:16:49.079 this one thing and so I'm going to paint
00:16:51.000 a different picture for you if I played
00:16:54.880 video games all day and someone came up
00:16:57.880 to me and said hey why don't you go
00:16:59.880 outside and I say I don't want to go
00:17:01.839 outside I want to keep playing video
00:17:03.040 games the thing is is that that person's
00:17:05.039 making some moral judgment that I should
00:17:07.559 do something that they have projected
00:17:08.959 onto my life now I'm a big believer in
00:17:12.000 personal freedom which is if you want to
00:17:13.760 play video games every hour every day
00:17:15.280 until the day you die that's your
00:17:16.520 prerogative It's not how I would want to
00:17:18.079 live my life but more power to you if
00:17:20.280 you have an outcome that you're
00:17:21.679 optimizing towards which would be
00:17:23.760 Financial wealth which is kind of the
00:17:25.839 point of my channel the people who work
00:17:27.559 the most tend to make the most money and
00:17:29.320 there's a number of reasons for that so
00:17:31.679 number one is you make more money when
00:17:33.799 you work more because you have less time
00:17:35.520 to spend it that sounds obvious but I
00:17:37.440 think it's like kind of silly like if
00:17:39.480 you work you make more if you stop
00:17:42.039 working you not only don't make you also
00:17:44.080 spend so it's a it's a it's a negative
00:17:46.280 to positive swing it's actually
00:17:47.640 disproportionate the next thing is that
00:17:49.919 um a friend of mine messaged Elon about
00:17:52.000 vacations he's like hey you should you
00:17:53.559 should go on vacation or we should go
00:17:55.120 here for vacation and elon's response
00:17:57.440 was I don't do vacation
00:17:59.799 and I was like man I love this guy I
00:18:02.120 bring this up yet again because I feel
00:18:04.360 like the more you get in the game the
00:18:05.840 more addicted to the game you get and I
00:18:07.679 think that addiction is just a term that
00:18:09.600 Society uses for activities that people
00:18:11.720 do that have negative consequences
00:18:13.480 rather than simply things that you do on
00:18:15.640 a regular basis well I'm addicted to
00:18:17.960 food because I do it every day I'm
00:18:19.200 addicted to sleep because I do it every
00:18:20.440 day I'm addicted to talking to Lila
00:18:21.640 because I do it every day and so it's
00:18:23.120 just that addictions is when they decide
00:18:25.360 that the outcome of that thing is
00:18:26.640 somehow negative but if the outcome of
00:18:28.400 what I do helps more businesses grow and
00:18:30.520 is something that I enjoy why is this
00:18:32.240 wrong and so we did two very bad
00:18:35.120 vacations this year one was in July 4th
00:18:37.720 which I ended up basically just
00:18:38.679 traveling and then working the whole
00:18:39.840 time so I don't know if I would consider
00:18:41.080 that a vacation and then the other one
00:18:42.760 we went to truly do a vacation and so
00:18:46.520 this one was going to be 2 days and we
00:18:49.720 got there and it was this beautiful
00:18:51.480 luxury resort and there's only 22 Villas
00:18:53.679 it's like three or four people per Villa
00:18:55.480 like very you know ritzy whatever and I
00:18:57.720 look out on the patio of the Villa that
00:18:59.840 we have over the mountains and I'm like
00:19:02.559 man this is beautiful and I don't care
00:19:06.480 and I think it was this realization that
00:19:08.320 even vacations were something that had
00:19:10.520 been passed on to me from someone
00:19:12.320 earlier in my life that I was something
00:19:14.960 that I should do that I must do this or
00:19:18.039 else I will not gain their approval and
00:19:20.240 I will get judgment from people that I
00:19:23.039 care about but when I think about who do
00:19:25.120 I care about who would care about
00:19:26.720 whether or not I go on vacation there
00:19:28.760 very very few and they certainly don't
00:19:30.440 have the things that I want or have
00:19:32.159 accomplished what I would like to
00:19:33.320 accomplish and so why would I listen to
00:19:35.000 them the big conclusion that I've had
00:19:36.480 from this whole thing was maybe
00:19:38.520 vacations aren't for me or maybe they're
00:19:40.120 not for me right now and that's totally
00:19:43.480 okay who made the rule that vacations
00:19:45.240 must exist humans existed for a very
00:19:47.360 long time before vacations were a thing
00:19:49.240 and so the idea that this is a
00:19:50.559 requirement for humans is very foreign
00:19:53.159 and feels societally programmed also
00:19:55.919 takes into the assumption that you have
00:19:58.120 the money for the vacations it's
00:20:00.120 basically a privileged thing that you
00:20:02.120 then cast a projection onto somebody
00:20:03.720 else saying they should exercise this
00:20:05.720 privilege because that's what you would
00:20:07.440 do in their position but maybe the
00:20:09.440 reason you would do it in their position
00:20:11.120 is why you're not in their position and
00:20:13.280 so one of the other things that we did
00:20:14.559 this year is that we traveled
00:20:15.679 significantly less and so this year in
00:20:18.000 total I think we took somewhere in the
00:20:19.360 neighborhood 12 you know 10 to 12 days
00:20:21.919 off in total and I would Define a day
00:20:24.280 off as not working at all that would be
00:20:27.280 a day off and so I would say workday I
00:20:29.159 would Define as more than C four hours
00:20:32.159 of work as a work day so maybe on the
00:20:33.440 days off I would still consider I worked
00:20:34.880 for a few hours but I'll count that as a
00:20:36.480 day off so big picture The increased
00:20:38.840 focus and decrease in change in
00:20:40.880 variables in my environment allowed me
00:20:43.200 to work more because I had fewer
00:20:45.840 changing variables that I had to
00:20:47.400 accommodate on a regular basis and so
00:20:49.840 Lela and I were looking over our
00:20:51.039 calendars yesterday we did a joint
00:20:52.440 podcast going over each month of the
00:20:53.919 year like what we focused on in that
00:20:55.400 month and what was interesting is that
00:20:57.280 we kept swiping through it it was just
00:20:58.640 just like work work work just like an
00:21:01.919 onslaught of things that we did over and
00:21:03.760 over and over again and I can tell you
00:21:05.760 this is that the periods where I've had
00:21:07.360 tremendous Financial growth across
00:21:10.240 different companies that I founded have
00:21:12.240 almost always had these very long
00:21:15.640 periods where I just have to do reps and
00:21:19.200 this is like I'm in a rocky cut scene of
00:21:21.000 my own right now and I know that it's
00:21:22.760 likely going to take three-ish years and
00:21:25.440 I'm probably about a year in and I
00:21:27.159 probably have two more years to get to
00:21:29.159 the other side and it's just that I've
00:21:31.200 been on this roller coaster before and I
00:21:33.400 know how the song goes it's less like
00:21:36.559 weird for me and also I don't have the
00:21:38.520 anxiety of will this be forever I know
00:21:40.640 it's not going to be forever and I know
00:21:42.200 that it's a season and even if it is
00:21:43.760 forever I have found that it's far more
00:21:46.880 productive for me to work seven days a
00:21:49.240 week 8 to 10 hours a day than it is for
00:21:52.039 me to work five and take two people have
00:21:54.559 different preferences but for me it's
00:21:57.080 kind of like the summer Gap in learning
00:21:59.480 so when kids take 3 months off for the
00:22:01.360 summer they have this whole summer
00:22:03.120 catchup that they have to do which takes
00:22:04.559 like another quarter for them to just
00:22:06.080 get back to where they were and so if
00:22:07.600 you think about the 3 months plus the
00:22:09.200 katchup it's like kids are only like net
00:22:11.799 positive for like 6 months of the year
00:22:13.679 and the other 6 months they're not so
00:22:14.880 they're basically learning at half speed
00:22:16.799 from an entrepreneur perspective we're
00:22:18.440 incentivized to get as much quality work
00:22:20.679 done as possible and so for me I work
00:22:23.200 very well on realistically a 10 to 12
00:22:26.039 hour a day schedule obviously there's
00:22:28.039 probably two or 3 days a week that I'll
00:22:29.600 work 16 to 18 but I would say my my true
00:22:32.679 average is probably 7 days a week of 12
00:22:35.480 and i' would say weekends are shorter
00:22:37.200 and I probably have two or three days
00:22:38.360 like I said during the week that are
00:22:39.440 probably 18s and so that gets me
00:22:41.080 somewhere in the 90 hours a week range
00:22:42.799 but for me that's actually fairly doable
00:22:44.960 because my wife's here with me I have a
00:22:46.919 gym downstairs I have all the people
00:22:48.840 that I care about and I I care about
00:22:50.880 them because they support me they take
00:22:52.200 interest in my goals and they want to
00:22:54.159 help me accomplish them they increase
00:22:55.440 the likelihood that those goals occur
00:22:56.799 and so what else could I ask from
00:22:58.039 someone for my life like what I'm I'm
00:23:00.480 very happy with my life and I think that
00:23:02.080 a lot of people take offense to me being
00:23:04.120 happy about my life because they think
00:23:05.360 that I cast judgment on them living
00:23:07.000 differently you can do whatever you want
00:23:08.360 I make this channel because I've been
00:23:09.440 trying to document this since I had
00:23:10.760 nothing all the way to a billion dollars
00:23:12.279 plus and just say what's worked for me
00:23:14.720 my team asked me to clarify this because
00:23:16.240 they're with me a 100 days straight
00:23:17.960 means no weekends so I just worked the
00:23:20.159 first 100 days of the year so that took
00:23:21.760 me into whatever that is April so a lot
00:23:23.520 of you hear 100 days and think oh my God
00:23:25.840 my friends would throw a fit if I worked
00:23:27.600 100 days straight
00:23:28.960 well if you want better friends then
00:23:32.159 expect to see them less because better
00:23:34.559 friends are busy friends better friends
00:23:36.840 are doing things with their lives and I
00:23:39.760 don't know about you but I would rather
00:23:41.200 see someone less frequently who's
00:23:42.960 actually pursuing great things than
00:23:45.559 someone who's always available to see me
00:23:47.559 all the time and has zero material
00:23:49.799 updates because they are in no way
00:23:51.279 growing or getting better because my
00:23:52.760 biggest fear would that they rub off on
00:23:54.360 me and the friends that I have now I can
00:23:56.520 count on one hand and almost all of them
00:23:58.520 are entrepreneur I say almost they're
00:23:59.840 all entrepreneurs and they're all very
00:24:01.559 high level entrepreneurs and we
00:24:03.559 basically stay in touch via text and
00:24:05.720 none of them live in the same state as
00:24:07.200 me all of my friends treat text like
00:24:09.919 email which is like we text and none of
00:24:13.200 us have an expectation of response it's
00:24:15.120 like oh I can't believe you didn't
00:24:16.159 respond to my text for three days it is
00:24:18.000 super normal for each of my friends to
00:24:20.760 have not responded to me and for me not
00:24:22.240 to respond to them for days at a time
00:24:25.000 and none of us blow up and have a
00:24:28.000 tantrum
00:24:29.039 because we know the other person's busy
00:24:30.760 and they'll get to it when they get to
00:24:31.919 it so with on on the on the on the back
00:24:34.399 end of that uh serious note fun things
00:24:37.320 did happen this year and so I ended up
00:24:39.440 buying aq.com three-letter domain from
00:24:42.640 Yahoo and so they had owned that since
00:24:44.840 1998 or9 I can't remember it was 90 it
00:24:47.279 was 96 through 98 so they had owned it
00:24:49.600 for like 26 years something like that
00:24:52.279 and I finally was able to wrestle it
00:24:54.600 from there from their grip and so that
00:24:56.520 was really cool for those of you curious
00:24:58.000 it was $480,000 to buy the domain I
00:25:00.559 don't buy a lot of crazy and um I'm
00:25:03.279 allowed to spend my money however I want
00:25:04.760 to spend it and I think aq.com is dope
00:25:08.240 and so on the back end of that part of
00:25:09.720 the reason I did that was because we
00:25:11.000 just uh stood up acq Ventures so really
00:25:13.320 proud of that it's primarily focused on
00:25:16.039 uh SAS and Tech enabled Services the
00:25:18.399 reason that we're doing it is basically
00:25:20.159 because our family office which
00:25:22.039 functions like a private Equity but it's
00:25:23.399 a family office in that we don't have uh
00:25:25.600 outside LPS or limited partners people
00:25:27.320 who give us money so we don't have any
00:25:28.600 people give us money it's all our money
00:25:29.880 which is why it's a family office but in
00:25:31.399 terms of the day-to-day most family
00:25:32.640 offices tend to be passive we are very
00:25:34.200 active in our investments and we take
00:25:35.760 significantly larger positions and so we
00:25:38.360 stood this up because we have a
00:25:40.240 tremendous amount of people who who uh
00:25:42.520 who are entrepreneurs we meet uh through
00:25:44.440 the various things that we do that would
00:25:46.440 like uh investment they would like help
00:25:48.760 but they don't want to necessarily hand
00:25:50.000 over control or hand over have that
00:25:51.919 level of Engagement and so we we stood
00:25:54.279 up acq Ventures because there's just
00:25:55.480 honestly a ton of demand for a different
00:25:58.360 capital structure uh for our investments
00:26:00.919 we just did our first three Deals in acq
00:26:02.880 Ventures I think should finalize in the
00:26:04.159 next week or two so before the end of
00:26:05.279 the year kind of cool and so that will
00:26:07.120 be a much higher volume deal side for
00:26:10.679 acquisition. comom and that Branch will
00:26:12.279 just be on the Venture side well
00:26:13.600 speaking of big things that I did this
00:26:15.279 year I worked a crazy amount on the $100
00:26:18.200 million scaling road map and it's yours
00:26:19.960 for free and I'll tell you how to get it
00:26:21.600 right now I did it across all eight
00:26:23.080 departments so the departments were
00:26:25.000 sales marketing customer service product
00:26:28.440 it HR recruiting and finance and so what
00:26:32.039 problem exists at every level and I
00:26:33.600 broke it into 10 stages and what you
00:26:35.320 need to do to graduate from that level
00:26:37.440 so you can literally just look at your
00:26:38.600 own business and see what things you're
00:26:40.520 missing what things you're lagging on
00:26:41.760 maybe sometimes what things you're ahead
00:26:43.159 on because it's very neat to put these
00:26:45.279 things into 10 stages but reality is
00:26:47.159 messy and so it's more that you'll be at
00:26:49.240 stage five you'll have some things that
00:26:51.120 you're at stage seven on and some things
00:26:52.679 that you're at stage three on but those
00:26:54.279 stage three things will likely be things
00:26:56.039 that you will need to fix sooner than
00:26:57.799 the things that you're at stage seven on
00:26:59.360 right and so it's very much the
00:27:00.240 constraints concept where you have a
00:27:01.679 weak link and this helps you see where
00:27:03.399 you're the furthest behind so you can
00:27:04.960 kind of uplevel those things faster and
00:27:07.200 so I just dropped the training it's at
00:27:09.679 acquisition. comom trining and so if you
00:27:12.840 want to write down the link this is it
00:27:14.799 it's acquisition. comom trining and just
00:27:19.399 click the $100 million scaling roadmap
00:27:22.440 and you can go there we also have a
00:27:24.080 little button there that you can get a
00:27:25.159 personalized plan made for you so you
00:27:26.679 just answer some questions and we'll
00:27:28.240 tell you what stage uh you are at and
00:27:30.919 we'll give you the one before and the
00:27:31.919 one after so you know what you should be
00:27:33.080 finished and what you have a line of
00:27:34.120 sight to uh it's absolutely free uh you
00:27:36.399 can just go there and uh enjoy it's 14
00:27:38.399 hours you don't need to watch the whole
00:27:39.600 thing just watch the section that's
00:27:40.760 that's specific to your business right
00:27:41.919 now so big thing right now is growth
00:27:45.360 Trends so I think this might be one of
00:27:47.399 the most valuable sections uh of this
00:27:49.080 video for you guys and historically when
00:27:51.480 I would do my podcast recap of the year
00:27:54.039 was always my most popular episode and
00:27:55.600 so now I'm just doing it on YouTube but
00:27:57.240 these were the things that I would say
00:27:58.519 we learned or that we doubled down on in
00:28:00.279 the portfolio that yielded really good
00:28:01.720 results so number one is we focused a
00:28:05.120 lot on leadership Talent recruiting all
00:28:08.200 right so you call this key player
00:28:09.919 recruiting um and the big thing here is
00:28:12.519 that I kind of switched my perspective
00:28:14.679 on this which is fundamentally if you
00:28:16.679 listen to Steve Jobs you listen to Bezos
00:28:18.760 you listen to Zuckerberg a lot of them
00:28:20.440 take a a hugely active role in bringing
00:28:23.880 in top talent and so my understanding of
00:28:26.559 talent has been probably the single
00:28:27.720 largest shift that I've had this year in
00:28:29.159 terms of my understanding of business
00:28:30.440 and why I think that we're
00:28:31.640 disproportionately growing across the
00:28:32.799 portfolio the companies that are doing
00:28:33.919 the best are the ones that we've been
00:28:35.360 able to to place key players and part of
00:28:38.440 that is being willing as the CEO as the
00:28:41.240 founder to actively show interest in
00:28:44.559 these types of people and they are the
00:28:45.880 type of people that would not respond to
00:28:48.480 traditional recruiter because they are
00:28:50.760 either so good at what they do and they
00:28:52.640 want to know that their investment in
00:28:54.399 the compan is going to be valuable these
00:28:55.840 are not the type of people who feel
00:28:58.240 you're giving them an opportunity to
00:28:59.840 work for you these are the types of
00:29:01.320 people that they are giving you the
00:29:03.200 opportunity of helping build your
00:29:05.320 business bringing their entire Rolodex
00:29:07.960 of people they already know teams that
00:29:09.960 sometimes they can they can bring with
00:29:11.200 them and just a huge stack of skills
00:29:13.519 that ideally should disproportionately
00:29:15.960 benefit the business and fundamentally
00:29:17.559 this is one of the highest leverage
00:29:19.960 things that you can do because at the
00:29:21.600 most basic level what you need to do as
00:29:24.000 a CEO is attract the absolute best
00:29:26.799 people and align incentives ruthlessly
00:29:29.440 for them to work and then get out of
00:29:31.200 their way and so that was probably the
00:29:34.159 the one of the biggest ones number two
00:29:36.919 was was Focus all right now I talk about
00:29:39.120 focus a lot so I'm I'm going to try and
00:29:40.679 say this in a different way than I
00:29:41.679 normally do it's really top down focus
00:29:44.399 and prioritization which is just another
00:29:46.080 word for strategy but just how much more
00:29:48.679 important strategy is for businesses
00:29:51.519 because what happens is when they pursue
00:29:53.559 too many paths they get they look up a
00:29:55.600 year later and they haven't grown much
00:29:57.080 at all and if if you're a small business
00:29:59.000 like you absolutely can double triple
00:30:00.720 quadruple 5x every year for a few years
00:30:03.519 before sometimes that'll slow down now
00:30:04.919 if you have a compounding mechanism it
00:30:06.200 could even keep going and getting faster
00:30:08.080 at the very least like growing at 10% a
00:30:10.080 year again there's nothing wrong with
00:30:11.480 that but if you're at a million bucks a
00:30:13.159 year or five million bucks a year even
00:30:14.159 $10 million a year like you should be
00:30:15.840 able to grow a lot faster than that and
00:30:17.720 typically it's because you lack people
00:30:19.919 and because you lack focus and when I
00:30:21.760 say people it means you lack good enough
00:30:23.799 people the people you have you might
00:30:25.799 have a a high headcount but a low Talent
00:30:28.039 account and focus you might have lots of
00:30:29.760 priorities but they're the wrong ones
00:30:31.880 and so fundamentally if you can't focus
00:30:34.679 on one thing one objective that is most
00:30:38.080 important that makes the rest of your
00:30:39.799 objectives less important then you are
00:30:42.000 not doing your job as the CEO to tell
00:30:44.880 the team how they should be allocating
00:30:47.200 their attention and that and here's the
00:30:49.039 important part is
00:30:51.399 deleting everything that is not this and
00:30:55.320 so a lot of people are like these are
00:30:56.440 our objectives also keep doing
00:30:58.200 everything else it's like you can't do
00:30:59.519 that you can't just add more because now
00:31:01.519 you you've even further diluted what's
00:31:03.760 important now for sure people need to
00:31:05.559 continue transact sales guys still need
00:31:06.960 to sell customer service still needs to
00:31:08.200 service but the discretionary effort
00:31:09.960 that exists in the top talent the
00:31:11.639 leaders of the company who aren't as
00:31:13.320 involved in the day-to-day and are
00:31:15.000 basically all times they have between
00:31:17.240 aligning teams should be dedicated to a
00:31:20.200 single priority that if accomplished
00:31:22.240 would be an order of magnitude
00:31:23.960 Improvement in the business and so this
00:31:26.159 level of focus is what I continue to
00:31:28.000 drill with the founders and the CEOs of
00:31:30.760 the portfolio companies and it has
00:31:32.120 yielded outsize returns and there's a
00:31:34.399 great razor for this which is when I
00:31:36.600 want to fix a system or when I go into a
00:31:38.519 department the first thing I do is
00:31:40.360 eliminate as much as humanly possible
00:31:42.720 and here's the thing is people are
00:31:43.960 afraid of eliminating meetings
00:31:45.159 eliminating communication lines
00:31:46.480 eliminating processes but if you
00:31:48.200 eliminate just about everything you'll
00:31:50.279 find out that the vast majority of that
00:31:51.760 stuff was complete waste and complete
00:31:53.440 distraction and here's the cool thing
00:31:55.279 you can always add it back so there's
00:31:57.159 this sphere of loss people literally
00:31:58.960 have fear of loss around processes and
00:32:01.480 meetings which is ridiculous but that's
00:32:03.200 just how we're wired psychologically
00:32:04.840 which is why companies in general as
00:32:06.919 they grow create bloat there's too many
00:32:09.240 people doing too many things that don't
00:32:11.480 matter or not enough stuff to begin with
00:32:14.120 and all of them together don't know how
00:32:16.639 what they do makes the company money and
00:32:18.919 so one of the easiest tasks that you can
00:32:21.480 do is zoom all the way out and think
00:32:23.799 what is the output of this department
00:32:26.240 what is the output of Finance have you
00:32:28.000 ever thought about like what is the
00:32:28.919 output of Finance the output of Finance
00:32:30.679 is information to make decisions that's
00:32:32.880 it and so if you're getting too much
00:32:35.399 information or you're getting the wrong
00:32:36.880 information or the information that
00:32:38.440 you're getting doesn't change your
00:32:39.519 decisions then the function of Finance
00:32:41.440 is inadequate you're not getting enough
00:32:43.880 of what you need of output from that
00:32:45.600 department if the function of it is to
00:32:48.120 gather store display and analyze
00:32:49.760 information then are you getting the
00:32:52.080 correct data are you able to analyze it
00:32:54.360 are you able to display it and see in
00:32:55.880 real time um and be able to make
00:32:57.840 decisions off it also another
00:32:59.399 information output Department kind of
00:33:00.960 interesting right so many of these
00:33:02.480 departments really exist just to have
00:33:04.840 information to make decisions and so I
00:33:07.039 bring this up because you have to delete
00:33:09.360 until you have the fewest things that
00:33:10.760 matter it's like you want to cut to the
00:33:11.960 Bone you don't want to cut to fat or cup
00:33:14.000 muscle you want to go all the way to the
00:33:15.120 Bone and then add the few things that
00:33:17.159 matter most back in and I think that I'm
00:33:19.320 doing this better now because honestly I
00:33:21.120 think I'm just more ruthless and I think
00:33:22.519 I care less about judgments of other
00:33:26.200 people I think I'm honestly I think it's
00:33:27.639 just like I'm more confident what I'm
00:33:28.919 doing now and so it's like I think I
00:33:30.679 conceptually felt the same way I just
00:33:33.600 was like this feels crazy even though it
00:33:36.159 makes sense to me and so fundamentally
00:33:37.919 first principles thinking operates from
00:33:39.880 this perspective of like okay physics
00:33:41.919 are laws that we have to obey what else
00:33:44.159 do we have to obey the law of the land
00:33:46.360 so we've got government laws that we
00:33:47.720 have to obey besides that tell me a
00:33:49.840 physical law or government law that
00:33:51.799 prevents us from doing this thing in one
00:33:53.720 tenth of the time tell me the law if not
00:33:55.559 then there is a way and here's the thing
00:33:57.799 is that there will simply be resources
00:33:59.639 that are required and so one of the
00:34:01.000 things that I'm trying to get my team to
00:34:02.559 understand is if I ask to do something
00:34:04.919 and they say we can't do it that's
00:34:06.519 saying it's impossible and it's
00:34:07.760 ridiculous and of course they're wrong
00:34:09.320 so it's a terrible position to take it's
00:34:10.800 also very frustrating instead tell me
00:34:13.800 what it would take tell me the resources
00:34:16.199 that would be required that we'd have to
00:34:17.560 take from something else and then we
00:34:19.839 together can decide whether it's worth
00:34:21.960 the trade so for example if my whole
00:34:25.159 media team I said hey I want to make AEM
00:34:27.320 motion picture for example right I'm not
00:34:29.000 saying I want to do that let's say that
00:34:30.440 we decided that was a big a big
00:34:32.119 strategic party if we were to get one
00:34:34.040 big motion picture that was as big as
00:34:35.599 Avatar uh then it would be you know
00:34:37.480 maybe it would do things for the
00:34:38.520 business okay then they might say well
00:34:40.480 we can't do that now implicit in that
00:34:42.599 statement is we can't do that and keep
00:34:44.879 making content at the at the level that
00:34:46.440 we're at so then we'd say okay well if
00:34:49.280 we allocated all the resources and stop
00:34:51.280 making content and we actually were able
00:34:52.719 to get a featurelength film with the
00:34:54.320 existing media team would the benefit of
00:34:56.760 that be worth the the cost and if it is
00:34:59.560 then great we'll do it but a lot of
00:35:01.800 times we get a we get a soft no
00:35:03.880 immediately out the gate rather than a
00:35:05.760 what it would take and this has been one
00:35:07.079 of the biggest shifts that I think has
00:35:08.839 empowered me is asking better questions
00:35:11.640 and so one of the most frequently asked
00:35:13.520 questions that I will probably my
00:35:14.800 question of the year is what would it
00:35:16.920 take and by doing this the reason I
00:35:18.640 think it's such a powerful question it
00:35:19.800 also works for deals it works for sales
00:35:21.520 it works for anything is that it assumes
00:35:24.440 the result occurs it assumes success and
00:35:27.760 so because it assumes success you work
00:35:29.480 backwards from the reality that you want
00:35:31.160 to create rather than forwards trying to
00:35:34.359 figure it out as you go I'll tell you
00:35:35.800 something funny so we had a company that
00:35:37.800 we were looking at and um in the
00:35:39.839 diligence process I said hey you've got
00:35:42.079 this downsell basically no one takes it
00:35:44.440 have you considered just giving it away
00:35:45.680 for free to get more leads and they
00:35:48.160 ended up doing it and they tripled their
00:35:50.240 lead flow the next
00:35:51.920 week and so that downsell was worth
00:35:55.160 maybe 5% of Revenue but what's the value
00:35:57.440 of tripling lead flow tripling revenue
00:35:59.560 and probably disproportionately dropping
00:36:00.960 to the bottom line so tripling really
00:36:02.640 would triple lead flow so it would cut
00:36:04.160 CAC by 2/3 but fundamentally it would it
00:36:06.599 would triple the business and so there
00:36:09.000 are so many of these little things that
00:36:10.839 exist inside of companies and just being
00:36:13.200 focused enough to say no this is our
00:36:14.880 core product this is where we make all
00:36:16.560 of our money anything that's not that
00:36:18.319 distracts us from making this thing
00:36:19.560 better so theme number three was cro and
00:36:23.800 so I'd say this year the companies that
00:36:25.680 made the biggest gains uh had a
00:36:28.920 discipline around conversion rate
00:36:30.880 optimization and so that means that at
00:36:33.319 any given point they're running three to
00:36:35.760 10 different split tests on the key
00:36:39.560 parts of the pipeline for Revenue
00:36:41.560 generation meaning if you have a landing
00:36:43.960 page where you get a lot of traffic or
00:36:45.280 you have a homepage that you get a lot
00:36:46.560 of traffic or you have a follow-up
00:36:47.760 sequence that a huge percentage of your
00:36:49.240 customers are in actually testing things
00:36:51.240 out there so one of the companies we had
00:36:53.839 had three cro improvements and this was
00:36:57.000 the largest company we have in the
00:36:58.400 portfolio so we got A plus 20% cro test
00:37:01.480 Improvement which is a mass a monster
00:37:03.319 win especially at the level of
00:37:04.640 optimization that this company's in so
00:37:06.200 we're talking eight figures plus a month
00:37:07.520 in Revenue like it's a big company and
00:37:09.640 So 20% lift is huge but on top of that
00:37:12.400 we got a 50% lift and then we got a 28%
00:37:16.560 lift so we had three Mega wins now the
00:37:19.000 question is how many split tests did we
00:37:20.880 have to do for that I mean probably 100
00:37:23.440 but the thing is is that that was
00:37:25.000 basically one guy and a couple devs
00:37:28.440 split basically running these sprints on
00:37:30.480 a regular basis but how valuable is that
00:37:32.640 to the company tremendously valuable
00:37:35.160 because things that are efficiency uh
00:37:37.119 improvements typically are long lasting
00:37:39.440 what's cool about that is that when you
00:37:40.640 have an efficiency Improvement it means
00:37:42.079 your LTV to CAC ratio expands which
00:37:44.160 allows you to spend more money in
00:37:46.280 advertising more money in Talent
00:37:48.640 acquisition all the way around the
00:37:50.040 business it literally just makes the
00:37:51.119 business stronger and is a competitive
00:37:53.040 mode and so I'll give you a little hack
00:37:55.160 that is worth looking at which is many
00:37:57.800 businesses integrate thirdparty tools
00:37:59.920 into your processes right you've got a
00:38:01.640 100 different softwares that you
00:38:03.000 probably pay for what none of those
00:38:04.800 softwares typically advertise is what
00:38:07.560 their conversion rate is and so if
00:38:09.480 anything is customer facing that a
00:38:12.200 prospect might interact with I would
00:38:14.359 look at three or four other tools within
00:38:16.319 the exact same use case and see which
00:38:18.839 one has a higher conversion rate on the
00:38:21.000 ux so the user experience I think you
00:38:23.119 will get
00:38:24.160 disproportionate Returns on that it's
00:38:26.599 typically a heavier lift because
00:38:28.000 splitting between multiple tools is a
00:38:29.400 pain in the ass but I've seen monster
00:38:31.839 lifts there so those are the three
00:38:33.800 probably biggest themes which was people
00:38:37.040 focus and then optimization around the
00:38:39.240 things that worked really well across
00:38:40.960 the portfolio uh in 2025 now the next
00:38:44.280 part is okay well what are the
00:38:45.359 detractors right these are the things
00:38:46.680 that grew those businesses but what are
00:38:49.200 some of the things that hurt those
00:38:50.520 businesses and so I actually see this as
00:38:53.280 the personal stuff all right so we had a
00:38:55.400 few entrepreneurs that I think took
00:38:57.760 their foot off the gas they started
00:38:58.960 making more money than they'v been
00:38:59.960 accustomed to and we like this is good
00:39:01.760 enough and so this is where having you
00:39:03.680 know some people call it a big reason
00:39:04.920 why you can have whatever you want as
00:39:07.000 long as you change your behavior I don't
00:39:08.319 really care what it's a big reason why
00:39:09.520 or you just change but either way you
00:39:11.640 have to find something that's going to
00:39:13.640 keep driving you so for me it's the Love
00:39:15.680 of the Game I just enjoy business and so
00:39:17.440 I spend all my time doing business some
00:39:18.800 people don't enjoy business as much and
00:39:20.280 so it either has to be some mission that
00:39:22.079 you have around the problem that you
00:39:23.640 solve like it actually has to light you
00:39:25.240 up otherwise you will make enough money
00:39:27.920 and you'll stop pushing then now again
00:39:29.800 if you accomplish your goals that's
00:39:30.800 amazing that's great again I make my
00:39:32.280 channel for people who just want to
00:39:33.240 consistently grow consistently grow in
00:39:35.359 personal development and using money is
00:39:37.400 just a stick for seeing how how far how
00:39:39.560 far You' you've stacked your skills
00:39:41.200 right also not saying that money is a a
00:39:43.520 is a virtue or having money is a virtue
00:39:45.599 just saying that in general you step you
00:39:47.280 become more skilled and you can measure
00:39:48.680 how skilled you are in the game of
00:39:49.800 Business by the amount of money you make
00:39:51.560 now here's one that's going to be
00:39:52.960 uncomfortable for a lot of people is
00:39:55.640 spouses indoor partners and so one of
00:39:58.480 the big detractors believe it or not and
00:40:00.839 I've seen this and this is a big Focus
00:40:02.400 that Laya and I have across the team is
00:40:05.359 how much support do the key players on
00:40:09.880 your team and or the entrepreneurs have
00:40:12.760 from their spouses and so you basically
00:40:15.720 have the worst type of spouse which is a
00:40:18.440 spouse who actively decreases the likel
00:40:20.079 to your goals so they are constantly
00:40:21.880 reminding you of the negatives that
00:40:23.520 exist they're trying to constantly
00:40:25.240 distract you say hey stop working stop
00:40:26.960 talking about that let's do this instead
00:40:28.560 so not only do they try to get you to
00:40:29.760 stop working they try incentivize You by
00:40:31.839 doing something else and so it's
00:40:33.240 reversing a negative and a positive it's
00:40:34.839 like a double whimmy and the thing is is
00:40:36.880 that I want to be clear I don't think
00:40:38.160 there's malicious intention here but the
00:40:39.839 result of what they do still massively
00:40:41.960 damages the business like if you were to
00:40:43.680 think of an enemy what would an enemy do
00:40:45.440 they would try and get you to not think
00:40:46.839 about the business and then do something
00:40:48.720 else that you get addicted to instead
00:40:50.440 it's almost like going to the to your
00:40:52.280 competitor and be like try some heroin I
00:40:53.839 think you might like it what occurs is
00:40:56.200 more or less the same and again I'm not
00:40:57.800 talking about intention here I'm just
00:40:58.839 talking about what happens and so when
00:41:00.680 we looked back so we did like a
00:41:02.079 retroactive analysis of this of like who
00:41:04.040 were the stars who just crushed and kept
00:41:06.640 growing they were the ones who had
00:41:08.640 absolute spouse support who were like if
00:41:10.720 they need to work late they need to work
00:41:11.920 the weekends I'll pack them with a lunch
00:41:13.920 I'm you know I'm here at home and this
00:41:15.119 happened for husbands and wives both
00:41:16.640 sides the ones who where you had
00:41:18.800 somebody who came in who presented like
00:41:21.000 a star but then eventually fizzled was
00:41:23.560 typically because and this is where it's
00:41:24.839 so nefarious is that they would get into
00:41:26.720 a relationship ship at some point or
00:41:28.680 they they would upgrade the relationship
00:41:30.119 like they'd move in together right
00:41:31.240 something like that and that person
00:41:33.480 would have a disproportionate effect on
00:41:36.280 the entrepreneur and so what's really
00:41:37.960 interesting is that entrepreneurs are
00:41:39.400 typically we're so concerned with our
00:41:40.800 surroundings who we want in our space
00:41:42.520 who's who's good who's helping us out
00:41:44.760 and then for some reason the person who
00:41:46.880 has a 71 correlation with your
00:41:48.480 subjective well-being the person who
00:41:50.119 will probably have the largest influence
00:41:51.599 on your behavior in your life you don't
00:41:53.319 hold to the same standard and I find
00:41:54.839 that crazy but it happens all the time
00:41:56.960 and just just because everyone else does
00:41:58.119 it doesn't mean that it makes sense it's
00:41:59.800 also why most people are mediocre I
00:42:01.480 think that one is that if you're looking
00:42:03.720 to bring a highle person onto the team I
00:42:05.760 would consider talking to their spouse
00:42:07.119 just make just gauge their interest
00:42:08.800 level see if they're supportive like in
00:42:10.440 the middle they're neutral but I think
00:42:11.680 neutral becomes negative over time so
00:42:13.680 you need someone who's active who's
00:42:15.480 who's who when when the employee
00:42:17.920 inevitably has a bad day because
00:42:19.440 everyone does they say hey this is a
00:42:22.160 great job this is great for us as a
00:42:23.880 family like you got this I trust you I
00:42:27.200 believe in you I support you what can I
00:42:28.760 do to help tell me how I can make this
00:42:30.760 easier for you that is the type of
00:42:32.760 support you want whereas if you have
00:42:34.359 somebody who says let's leave work
00:42:36.000 outside it's home now and I I don't want
00:42:38.720 to hear about that let's do all this
00:42:39.880 other stuff instead that sounds innocent
00:42:42.920 the problem is that it decreases the
00:42:44.440 likelihood they win and again I know
00:42:45.800 this will be controversial so you know
00:42:47.960 take it or leave it again my two cense
00:42:50.240 you can tell me to shove it it's up to
00:42:51.520 you let's talk about the next big one so
00:42:53.720 uh in creating that scaling road map
00:42:55.400 that I was talking about earlier I
00:42:56.520 wanted to create like a micro cycle that
00:42:59.640 I felt had to exist within every process
00:43:02.559 right and so I'm going to break down two
00:43:04.200 different processes that are different
00:43:05.680 one is scaling the other is optimization
00:43:07.760 all right so I'm going to walk through
00:43:08.880 both so whenever you have a system
00:43:11.000 you'll typically start as the first step
00:43:14.359 so whatever you're doing you want to
00:43:15.480 start out you have to start Number One S
00:43:17.800 then you have C which is compound all
00:43:20.680 right so you have to do more okay great
00:43:23.920 we're doing more the next is augment so
00:43:27.119 so how do we do
00:43:29.000 better then we have leverage which is
00:43:32.280 how do we make it consistent right how
00:43:34.319 do we automate it and so I'll just I'll
00:43:36.359 I'll make this a little infinite thing
00:43:38.800 and then finally how do we expand again
00:43:41.480 and so this is actually a
00:43:44.800 loop between each of these steps so you
00:43:47.880 start and then you do more and then once
00:43:50.079 you do more you try to get better once
00:43:52.119 you get better and you know what works
00:43:53.680 you try and automate it and make it
00:43:55.119 consistent and have low volatility and
00:43:57.760 then you expand to the next territory
00:43:59.800 you expand to the next Channel you
00:44:01.520 expand to the next type of content you
00:44:03.400 expand to the next product the same
00:44:06.359 process and it's nice because it has
00:44:08.240 this little uh it's got this nice
00:44:09.680 acronym s c a l e and so it actually fit
00:44:13.480 in there um I was super pumped about
00:44:15.160 that and so now when I think about what
00:44:16.920 someone has to do next within an
00:44:18.200 apartment I have think okay where are
00:44:19.720 they at okay they just started this
00:44:21.240 thing so they just need to do more oh
00:44:22.720 they've done a lot okay so maybe there's
00:44:24.079 probably a lot of wayte so now we
00:44:25.240 probably should do better how can we
00:44:26.720 augment how can we streamline how can we
00:44:28.079 optimize once they're doing better it's
00:44:29.280 like okay they're doing really well but
00:44:30.880 there's more demand that's coming in how
00:44:32.359 can we make this consistent how can we
00:44:33.880 automate this or portions of this work
00:44:36.079 and then finally once we have this thing
00:44:37.520 airtight we're like cool how can we do
00:44:38.960 this again and we expand if we're
00:44:40.720 thinking about this within the context
00:44:42.359 of content it's like we start posting on
00:44:43.880 a channel then we say okay well one post
00:44:45.839 a day works can we do three posts a day
00:44:47.359 so we do more then we're like hey some
00:44:48.920 of these posts do better than others how
00:44:50.359 can we make our post better and then we
00:44:51.800 say cool what percentage of these
00:44:53.440 processes can we use AI for what things
00:44:55.800 can we pre-prep we can B basically make
00:44:57.520 better happen more easily and more
00:44:59.200 consistently how can we make it instead
00:45:00.400 of having you know one do 10K views and
00:45:02.839 one have a million views how can we get
00:45:04.599 all of them over 100k how can we get all
00:45:06.280 of them over 250k and then finally we're
00:45:08.680 like okay I think we've maxed out this
00:45:10.319 specific Channel how do we now go to Tik
00:45:12.800 Tok how do we take this process and go
00:45:14.119 to Snapchat or whatever so it works for
00:45:16.200 anything now the second process so
00:45:18.200 that's about scaling this is about
00:45:20.119 optimization and so this is typically
00:45:22.040 when you come in and fix something that
00:45:23.400 already exists and so I got to have a
00:45:25.520 lot of experience with this this year
00:45:27.200 because I took over media and conversion
00:45:29.960 within acquisition. comom and I haven't
00:45:31.720 operated day-to-day probably in like 5
00:45:33.319 years and so it was actually a ton of
00:45:34.839 fun for me because honestly it's just
00:45:36.160 like I've I've developed a lot of skills
00:45:37.599 since the last time I operated and uh
00:45:39.480 it's been great so anyways the first
00:45:40.880 thing is you question the requirements
00:45:42.760 and I got this framework from Elon and
00:45:45.000 it's freaking awesome so question the
00:45:46.920 requirements why are we doing everything
00:45:48.319 that we're doing please explain to me
00:45:49.880 how does this thing relate to this
00:45:51.400 output and this is why defining what
00:45:53.440 each Department is supposed to create is
00:45:55.680 so valuable you're the content team the
00:45:57.559 goal here is to make as much good
00:45:58.760 content as humanely possible anything
00:45:59.960 that does not facilitate content
00:46:01.520 Creation in terms of volume and quality
00:46:02.960 is waste if you're an engineering team
00:46:04.800 it's like you have code that you must
00:46:06.720 type which then creates software that
00:46:08.520 people can use and we want the quality
00:46:09.760 of that software to be really high and
00:46:11.319 so anything that does not relate to
00:46:12.800 those things are things that are waste
00:46:14.240 so we question why we do everything the
00:46:15.960 second once you kind of get lay of the
00:46:17.240 land after questioning is you delete and
00:46:19.599 you delete because the next few steps
00:46:21.920 are going to be adding resources to the
00:46:23.800 system and so you delete everything that
00:46:25.760 doesn't matter so the first step that I
00:46:27.119 did when I took over the media team was
00:46:29.160 I deleted all meetings now to be clear
00:46:31.480 it doesn't mean that we're never going
00:46:32.319 to have meetings again it just means
00:46:33.640 that I will find out which meetings
00:46:34.680 matter and then we will add those in
00:46:36.119 proportionally and so I said you can
00:46:37.760 have ad hoc discussions about clear
00:46:39.240 things but otherwise I'm canceling the
00:46:40.720 recurring meetings and I replaced all
00:46:42.160 team meetings all one-on ones with just
00:46:43.960 a daily huddle that way basically the
00:46:46.280 entire day and these were also deep
00:46:48.680 workers so everyone who's creating
00:46:50.240 content really just wants to get into
00:46:52.040 flow and anything that prevents flow
00:46:54.319 massively impacts their performance and
00:46:56.280 so it's like the solution of just adding
00:46:57.640 more people and adding more meetings
00:46:59.200 just gets more people to not work it's
00:47:00.880 terrible and most people also hate it
00:47:02.680 most people want to work and so once you
00:47:04.720 delete then you optimize which is saying
00:47:07.960 okay what of the things that we're doing
00:47:09.960 right now get us the most results what
00:47:11.800 is what are these things that get us the
00:47:13.520 least results what are the resourcers
00:47:15.240 required to do them as in like time
00:47:16.880 spent or money spent in order to get it
00:47:18.640 and then we optimize it so we say the
00:47:20.559 things that give us the most for the
00:47:22.160 least we put as the first priority the
00:47:23.880 next thing that gets us you know the
00:47:25.160 most for the most we put as the second
00:47:26.400 priority the things that get us a very
00:47:27.720 little amount that cost a lot we put at
00:47:29.559 the end and we're just basically going
00:47:30.599 to not do those things and so you
00:47:32.079 reoptimize the actual processes once
00:47:34.160 you've deleted everything else then you
00:47:37.000 pull up timelines you say how can we
00:47:39.040 make this happen faster how can we do
00:47:40.599 this in one/ tenth a time and what's
00:47:42.880 crazy is that you honestly can increase
00:47:45.319 the speed of things by 5x 10x it happens
00:47:47.839 it really it's it's mindblowing when you
00:47:50.440 do it CU you're like I can't believe how
00:47:52.079 much waste we've had this whole time all
00:47:53.480 you do is when you ask questions you say
00:47:55.880 how many hours do does that take and so
00:47:57.839 then someone's going to respond with how
00:47:59.280 many hours it take so rather than this
00:48:00.839 is the classic instead of doing end of
00:48:02.760 week deadlines you just make it end of
00:48:05.240 day and so if a team is used to
00:48:06.920 delivering something to a team meeting
00:48:08.720 every Monday and you say cool how many
00:48:10.400 hours does that take great let's have it
00:48:12.400 done by the end of the day you 7x the
00:48:14.960 speed of that team 7x and so some people
00:48:18.119 can't comprehend how one company can
00:48:19.559 grow at so much faster rate than others
00:48:21.200 and it's because of this resource
00:48:22.480 allocation they pull up time good
00:48:24.520 drivers make things happen faster
00:48:26.520 because companies's like if you
00:48:28.400 accomplish a goal in 100 years who cares
00:48:30.119 time is a huge function in business if
00:48:31.640 you don't have a process around pulling
00:48:33.319 up timelines consistently and here's why
00:48:35.359 it's so important because if you have
00:48:37.000 time today like let's say there's more
00:48:38.920 utilization on the team like you can
00:48:40.160 they have bandwidth and you pull stuff
00:48:41.480 up and they're like hey we don't need
00:48:42.520 that for another week like why are you
00:48:44.079 why are you making me do it by the end
00:48:45.520 of today because we don't know what's
00:48:46.920 going to happen next week and we might
00:48:48.599 have a priority next week that we do
00:48:50.119 need to get end of day and then when
00:48:51.640 that happens we still won't have done
00:48:53.200 this other thing and now we have to do
00:48:54.599 the other one so this other thing's now
00:48:56.200 two weeks
00:48:57.359 and so basically you want to use up all
00:49:00.359 available resources that are renewable
00:49:03.200 on a consistent basis to get the highest
00:49:05.359 return so I want to make sure like you
00:49:06.760 understand the argument there because
00:49:07.480 you're going to have to tell it to your
00:49:08.319 team the reason I'm going to drive this
00:49:10.160 outcome even though there's no apparent
00:49:12.400 outside urgency is because it assumes
00:49:15.920 that the future is going to be exactly
00:49:17.680 like today and one of the things I can
00:49:19.359 guarantee is that the future won't be
00:49:21.520 and that there will be things that you
00:49:22.880 didn't expect and when that day comes
00:49:25.440 you will want to have all of the things
00:49:27.440 that you've accomplished behind you
00:49:29.119 supporting you and have as many
00:49:30.960 resources as seemly possible available
00:49:33.319 to you to deploy in that moment because
00:49:35.680 the most adaptable player in the system
00:49:38.359 survives that is what survival of the
00:49:40.359 fittest means within the context of
00:49:41.559 business it's the most adaptable player
00:49:43.480 the most flexible and so the final step
00:49:45.720 here is automate same as before and so
00:49:49.720 this is what you look at when you're
00:49:50.680 trying to fix something or turn
00:49:52.160 something around or make it better all
00:49:53.079 right this is when you're trying to
00:49:53.799 scale something I I could probably come
00:49:55.160 up with something cute around optimized
00:49:56.359 but I many letters all right and so
00:49:59.440 hopefully those two Frameworks give you
00:50:01.240 two different ways to look at
00:50:02.640 departments when you come in you're like
00:50:03.760 okay is this a scale thing so we need to
00:50:05.359 do more we need to do better we need to
00:50:06.520 make it reliable or automated portion of
00:50:08.200 it or do we need to expand or is this
00:50:10.200 everything screwed up why are we doing
00:50:11.520 what we're doing okay delete all that
00:50:12.920 stuff optimize the things that get us
00:50:14.520 the most outcome pull up time
00:50:16.040 requirements then automate having these
00:50:17.599 types of Frameworks to solve problems
00:50:19.000 makes life so much easier which is why I
00:50:20.799 share it with you so the next one is
00:50:22.319 about success and failure and knowing
00:50:24.040 why so Professor bergerman from Stanford
00:50:26.319 has this this uh statement where he says
00:50:28.079 it's better to fail and know why you
00:50:29.880 failed than to succeed and not now
00:50:31.920 notwithstanding the outcome itself but
00:50:33.480 he's talking about you as an individual
00:50:34.799 it's better to know why you want why you
00:50:36.240 lost than not know why you won because
00:50:37.760 you can't learn anything from it
00:50:38.720 essentially it means that the success
00:50:39.839 was purely chance right which means you
00:50:41.200 can't repeat it and so Edison you know
00:50:43.119 had 10,000 ways not to know how to make
00:50:45.040 a light bulb right it's same kind of
00:50:46.400 idea and like if as long as you learn
00:50:47.920 from your failures on a long enough time
00:50:49.160 Horizon and you don't give up you will
00:50:50.400 win period And so an expert you can
00:50:52.200 Define as somebody who's made all the
00:50:53.280 mistakes that you can possibly make in a
00:50:54.480 very narrow field and so fundamentally
00:50:56.240 that's what we want want to be within
00:50:57.599 our businesses and So within that
00:50:59.760 context I have now spoken to a lot of
00:51:02.400 business owners because we started this
00:51:03.599 Workshop division so we could meet more
00:51:04.880 businesses so we could do acq Ventures
00:51:06.680 and obviously within the main portfolio
00:51:08.720 and that you're noticing I'm lining up a
00:51:10.319 lot of sheets here so there are what I
00:51:12.720 call the six Horsemen of of business
00:51:15.839 stagnation and so if you are stuck this
00:51:19.280 is for you so there are six reasons that
00:51:21.200 I've seen that have been continuous rock
00:51:23.160 and hard plac scenars and the reason
00:51:24.599 that business owners get stuck here is
00:51:26.280 because you have to choose between two
00:51:28.040 apparently impossible choices one is
00:51:31.040 pain today the other is pain forever and
00:51:33.319 both of them sting and that's why people
00:51:35.160 just Wade water in pain because hurts a
00:51:37.119 little bit less to keep pain forever
00:51:39.440 than have a lot of short-term pain now
00:51:41.559 so these are the big six so number one
00:51:45.520 is being underpriced this is how it
00:51:47.920 presents a business owner is at close to
00:51:50.119 full capacity so like let's say they
00:51:52.240 they provide some services and they're
00:51:53.599 like I can't I can't work any more than
00:51:55.119 I already have or my team can't work
00:51:56.880 anymore than it already is and and and
00:51:59.480 this is the key point and we're not
00:52:00.680 making money so when that occurs they
00:52:02.960 want to look at all these different
00:52:03.960 things but the problem is you're just
00:52:05.319 mispriced now there's the fear that if I
00:52:08.559 raise my price I will lose my customers
00:52:10.680 and then it will get worse right but the
00:52:13.720 thing is is that I have I have I have
00:52:15.480 shephered so many businesses through
00:52:17.200 price raises that it makes me sick and
00:52:19.839 the process of raising price works like
00:52:21.960 this you get to the price and then you
00:52:23.960 say a higher number and you keep going
00:52:26.720 up until people stop buying that is how
00:52:29.440 you do it in the back of knacken redneck
00:52:32.319 logic way that I prefer most times if
00:52:34.880 you're in that situation you get to pick
00:52:37.160 do you want to have a few people say no
00:52:39.240 and you make more money or do you want
00:52:41.680 to be barely above water and not be able
00:52:43.920 to expand forever because the reason you
00:52:46.240 can't expand the business is because you
00:52:47.240 don't have cash flow you don't have cash
00:52:48.160 flow because your prices are wrong and
00:52:49.720 so we need to fix the price once we fix
00:52:52.480 the price we'll free up cash with the
00:52:54.440 freed up cash we can expand a new
00:52:56.160 location
00:52:57.040 we can hire that key person that you
00:52:58.480 need to bring in number one if you are
00:53:00.599 full capacity and you aren't making
00:53:02.680 money you need to raise your price an
00:53:05.000 easy way to do it is every five plus 20
00:53:08.200 all right so I actually got this from
00:53:10.839 lifting weights it's the reverse of this
00:53:12.920 which is once you increase volume by 20%
00:53:15.720 bump your intensity up by five meaning
00:53:17.400 add five pounds right or 5% right so
00:53:19.839 bump volume by 20 bump intensity by five
00:53:22.880 and then volume will drop again but now
00:53:24.280 you have higher intensity and so it's
00:53:25.720 this kind of B balanced progression
00:53:28.119 process it's just a very simple one but
00:53:29.760 it actually works the same way for price
00:53:31.079 and so it's like you sell five customers
00:53:32.680 if they all say yes to that price or
00:53:34.839 around the same percentage or you net
00:53:36.400 more money overall you bump the price by
00:53:38.119 20% and do it again and you just keep
00:53:40.520 doing the five five and 20 keep doing 5
00:53:42.680 and 20 until eventually not enough
00:53:45.000 people are saying yes that you're
00:53:46.000 netting less money now the problem is if
00:53:47.920 you have small sales numbers it's harder
00:53:50.280 to hear no more often because your brain
00:53:53.319 isn't going to calculate the fact that
00:53:54.760 you made 20% more it's going to be
00:53:56.720 binary in its thinking of like it was a
00:53:58.319 yes or a no and the thing is is that if
00:54:00.480 you sell three people at twice the price
00:54:04.480 it's better than selling five people at
00:54:06.559 half the price but you're going to hear
00:54:08.000 no more often and so it's going to hurt
00:54:09.760 more but it is better for the business
00:54:11.319 for two reasons one you actually make
00:54:13.240 more money secondly and this is the big
00:54:15.000 one people forget you also have fewer
00:54:16.480 people to service so you have less cost
00:54:19.400 and more Revenue which those two things
00:54:21.559 together create a disproportionate
00:54:23.200 increase in profit big thing number one
00:54:25.200 fix your price
00:54:26.960 so the second big problem is
00:54:30.839 overcompensation now what I mean by this
00:54:33.079 is actually paying people not like
00:54:34.680 you're overcompensating for stuff okay
00:54:36.440 this typically happens when you have uh
00:54:38.240 a set of employees especially in service
00:54:39.520 businesses where you accidentally in the
00:54:40.960 beginning give some sort of Revenue
00:54:43.400 share or something like that so it
00:54:45.599 doesn't matter you can't out earn it
00:54:47.160 right like if you grow the business they
00:54:48.440 just grow their revenue like you you you
00:54:50.119 overcompensate them or you mcomp them
00:54:52.480 and maybe you did that in the beginning
00:54:53.559 because the revenue was really low and
00:54:55.200 you never thought you get to where
00:54:56.040 you're at now and then your big fear
00:54:58.040 right each one of these has a rock and
00:54:59.319 hard play scenario the big fear is if I
00:55:01.280 tell them that they're going that I have
00:55:02.520 to change the compensation they're going
00:55:03.880 to leave and the answer is maybe but if
00:55:06.880 you don't you'll never grow so what are
00:55:08.680 you going to do right you have to over
00:55:10.640 you have to go through the short-term
00:55:11.799 pain to get the long-term gain and so
00:55:13.799 the process that I'd recommend doing
00:55:15.599 number one is you Shore up the
00:55:16.680 infrastructure which means that you
00:55:17.640 bring someone else in that can do the
00:55:19.160 same thing as that person and do it at
00:55:20.680 the new price that you want to pay them
00:55:23.880 for then you can have the conversation
00:55:26.039 with them with more leverage and saying
00:55:27.599 hey the market is this I'm paying you
00:55:30.319 this I understand this is what I need to
00:55:32.319 pay you in order for us to accomplish
00:55:33.559 our goals which is what I sold you on is
00:55:34.920 that we want to accomplish this big
00:55:36.039 Vision with the business now I
00:55:37.799 understand that isn't like I'm changing
00:55:39.160 expectations and so go home talk to your
00:55:40.960 wife sleep on it and come back tomorrow
00:55:43.520 if you want to stay here for that
00:55:45.480 compensation I'll give you a delay so
00:55:47.760 this is the key part is you say hey I'll
00:55:49.319 keep paying you this for the next 2
00:55:50.720 months or 3 months whatever and after
00:55:53.359 that then you'll go to this new kind of
00:55:55.960 comp compens ation philosophy now if
00:55:58.359 they come back and say no I feel
00:55:59.799 underappreciated blah blah blah then
00:56:01.119 that's fine and the good news is you
00:56:02.319 already have somebody who's right there
00:56:03.319 ready to go that's the second big issue
00:56:05.319 the third big problem and this is a big
00:56:07.559 one is this is really common when you're
00:56:09.799 smaller so I'd say sub three million
00:56:11.520 this is you guys all right serve too
00:56:13.559 many I'll just say infinite avatars all
00:56:16.280 right meaning you serve too many
00:56:18.559 customers and what happens is all these
00:56:20.920 different people have different demands
00:56:22.720 and so they are telling you all these
00:56:25.079 different things and you can't get your
00:56:26.880 offer right you can't get your
00:56:28.000 advertising right because you're serving
00:56:29.599 too many people now again what's the
00:56:31.720 Rock and hardplay scenario well if I get
00:56:33.599 narrower on my avatar I'm going to sell
00:56:35.480 fewer customers and I'm getting all
00:56:36.880 these other people well to me number one
00:56:39.079 is if you fix your messaging you will
00:56:41.400 attract more of the right people but you
00:56:43.440 haven't been willing to take that bet
00:56:45.119 the alternative is you can try and be
00:56:46.559 every everything to everyone which you
00:56:48.000 know isn't going to work because it's
00:56:49.319 what you're already doing and you know
00:56:50.680 it's not working and so you have the
00:56:52.319 evidence that your your existing path is
00:56:54.119 going to stagnate you and so again Again
00:56:56.480 The Impossible choice is do you want to
00:56:57.960 keep stagnating forever and maybe you
00:56:59.319 make some money now but it's preventing
00:57:00.520 you from growing or are you willing to
00:57:02.559 and the business is about risk like you
00:57:04.720 have to be comfortable with risk like
00:57:06.599 this is going to all of these are risks
00:57:08.280 but the alternative is you never risk
00:57:10.079 and you stay exactly where you are and
00:57:11.280 so for me that is a much greater risk
00:57:12.799 it's like when you get into investing
00:57:14.599 anything you invest money into can go
00:57:16.319 down so you incur that risk but if you
00:57:17.920 never invest you absolutely will never
00:57:19.559 get wealthy so what are you going to do
00:57:21.760 right you have to take the small risk so
00:57:23.720 that you avoid the much larger long-term
00:57:25.839 risk and each of these is small
00:57:28.200 short-term risk to avoid large long-term
00:57:31.200 risk so here you have to Niche down who
00:57:33.640 you're serving which you do by 8020 so
00:57:36.480 that means you look at all of your
00:57:38.079 customers and you say what are the top
00:57:39.760 20% who are these people what do they do
00:57:42.680 where are they from and you say how do I
00:57:44.599 make this my message and how do I make
00:57:48.440 an offer that's only for them that they
00:57:50.520 would go nuts for and here's the part
00:57:52.079 people miss and price it accordingly so
00:57:55.200 if you have customer
00:57:56.920 that you provide five times the value to
00:57:58.960 and I'm sure you do have those people
00:58:01.039 well all of a sudden if you were to turn
00:58:02.720 some of these bad ones away then your
00:58:04.799 price could reflect the value that you
00:58:06.559 serve to only that much narrower Avatar
00:58:09.559 and that's okay and that's great so you
00:58:12.000 may yet again and by the way this is the
00:58:13.839 point make more money all of these are
00:58:15.920 counterintuitive which is why people get
00:58:17.400 stuck the next one the next Rock and
00:58:20.000 hardplay scenarios is overextension all
00:58:23.160 right so this one is you know Alex's
00:58:27.000 Alex's favorite this is Alex's greatest
00:58:28.880 hits of mistakes is me trying to take on
00:58:32.039 too many things I have a plate that's
00:58:33.520 this big and I try and I start putting
00:58:34.839 food on the table because I can't fit it
00:58:36.400 on the plate and typically this is where
00:58:38.359 you get ahead of your skis where you
00:58:40.559 open that second location when the first
00:58:42.319 location isn't really operating as much
00:58:44.319 as well as you think it is and as soon
00:58:45.839 as you go there the revenue from the
00:58:47.319 first one drops and you're like uhoh but
00:58:49.280 a lot of that was my profit and so now
00:58:51.000 you've got these fixed costs the
00:58:52.039 revenue's down and then you've got this
00:58:53.839 one but this one's new so it's not doing
00:58:55.200 as well as the first one was was and
00:58:56.640 your star person's there but you're not
00:58:58.359 there and so now you're splitting
00:58:59.440 between two locations and you're like oh
00:59:01.119 man now I'm actually making the same
00:59:02.240 amount as I was with one but now I have
00:59:03.480 two twice the risk and you're like oh
00:59:04.880 you know what the solution should be
00:59:05.960 I'll open a third and then between the
00:59:08.000 three now your profit goes down even
00:59:09.440 more and now you're not making any money
00:59:10.920 but you have three locations and you
00:59:12.240 have TR three times the risk and you're
00:59:13.520 stressed out of your mind so what do you
00:59:15.160 do honestly you have two solutions you
00:59:17.920 either have to hire incredibly
00:59:19.760 impressive people which means that
00:59:21.160 you're going to probably give up your
00:59:22.880 income in order to bring this person on
00:59:25.359 or you have to your losses you have to
00:59:27.079 prune the tree you have to reconcentrate
00:59:29.440 get it right and then scale back out
00:59:31.640 again the right way and so overextension
00:59:33.799 is typically a who problem which is you
00:59:35.760 don't have enough good people that you
00:59:37.119 left behind who can actually run it
00:59:38.720 without you and so this happens a lot of
00:59:41.799 times in like the1 to3 million range it
00:59:43.920 happens at all ranges but a lot there
00:59:46.799 because when you get there you typically
00:59:49.160 suck yourself out of the day today
00:59:50.359 you're not you're not you're not
00:59:51.440 actually selling people you're not doing
00:59:53.720 customer service and you're not doing
00:59:56.240 delivery but the issue is you think that
00:59:58.839 because you're not involved in the
01:00:01.599 acquisition and delivery that you're not
01:00:03.400 required to run the business but the
01:00:05.400 thing is is that you work every hour of
01:00:06.640 the day right now and so if you work
01:00:07.960 every hour of the day but you're not
01:00:09.119 selling and you're not delivering then
01:00:10.799 it means you're doing other stuff and
01:00:12.079 that other stuff you're doing is very
01:00:13.880 much operating the business and so a lot
01:00:16.119 of owners will mistakenly think that CEO
01:00:18.720 and owner mean the same thing you happen
01:00:20.440 to be both but they are not the same and
01:00:22.720 so right now is you leave so it's like
01:00:24.559 the CEO leaves the business and all of a
01:00:26.599 sudden the business stops running as
01:00:27.880 well because the CEO is gone so you have
01:00:30.720 to have somebody who's going to operate
01:00:32.520 behind you you have to basically
01:00:34.119 backfill yourself and in my opinion I
01:00:36.880 like a six-month test at the very least
01:00:38.480 do a one-month test which is go away for
01:00:40.599 a month and you hand your phone you show
01:00:42.799 your phone to your operator and you say
01:00:44.039 hey here's the deal you're going to get
01:00:45.200 this override on the business so a
01:00:48.000 little profit share whatever or some
01:00:49.280 stock and in doing that I'm doing this
01:00:52.160 in exchange for this not ringing that's
01:00:53.720 the deal and if this rings then that's
01:00:56.160 not the deal and so it's like then you
01:00:58.400 roll play it out so it's like let's say
01:00:59.760 a pipe burst what do you do if it's call
01:01:02.000 you wrong answer CU what do you think
01:01:03.280 I'm going to do I'm going to call a
01:01:04.039 plumber so what are you going to do just
01:01:05.280 call the plumber directly you don't need
01:01:06.359 to call me to call the plumber same idea
01:01:08.720 if it's an emergency call 911 if it's
01:01:11.240 not an emergency don't call me either
01:01:13.760 way don't call me and so this is the
01:01:16.000 trade so if you're overextended you
01:01:17.880 either got to dip into your own paycheck
01:01:19.240 to bring someone in or you got to prune
01:01:21.599 the tree reconcentrate and then build it
01:01:23.920 back right and the six-month test I was
01:01:26.079 alluding to is the business has to
01:01:27.960 either maintain or grow for six straight
01:01:30.640 months without your direct involvement
01:01:32.720 now that last point is the big one
01:01:34.319 without your direct involvement now some
01:01:35.880 of you are going to run that test still
01:01:37.599 continue to work in the day-to-day for
01:01:38.960 six months and then say oh I think I did
01:01:40.400 it but you just didn't change what you
01:01:41.760 did at all and the business continue to
01:01:43.280 operate with you as CEO which is not the
01:01:44.640 case so you just delay six months and
01:01:45.760 then you open the next location well
01:01:47.240 which should still make you a little bit
01:01:48.240 better in terms of your cash position
01:01:49.880 but not my recommendation so what's
01:01:52.279 what's what's number five so number five
01:01:55.039 is more than one business so this is
01:01:57.760 also an Alex special I have a lot of
01:02:00.079 specials here four and five are are my
01:02:02.480 my personal favorites uh that I've made
01:02:04.279 the most often which is you've got two
01:02:06.640 businesses or you've got three
01:02:07.960 businesses because you don't know how to
01:02:09.400 pick and you operate from the fallacy
01:02:11.279 that Zucker bird had a side hustle
01:02:12.799 Zuckerberg was also flipping airbnbs and
01:02:14.880 doing wholesaling on the side right and
01:02:16.359 that's how you build Facebook of course
01:02:17.839 not one of these businesses is the
01:02:19.680 business you should be doing and the
01:02:21.599 thing is is that the opportunity is the
01:02:23.559 problems that you need to solve and
01:02:24.760 aren't it's not in the
01:02:26.400 missed opportunities it's the problems
01:02:28.000 that need to be solved right it's the
01:02:29.400 hairy work that you're not sure what the
01:02:30.880 answer is but you know you need to fix
01:02:32.039 it that is where the opportunity is
01:02:33.880 because fundamentally If the product
01:02:34.799 were exceptional and everybody loved it
01:02:36.160 you wouldn't have an issue you'd be
01:02:37.079 going all in on that business and so if
01:02:38.880 that's the case then just do it now
01:02:41.880 you're going to have this sunk cost valy
01:02:43.200 of like I already put all this money
01:02:44.440 into this and I already already got it
01:02:45.640 going I already have a partner there yes
01:02:48.279 short-term risk you lose relationship
01:02:50.559 you lose maybe short-term income from
01:02:52.119 that from that business long-term risk
01:02:54.039 you never grow any of these things to
01:02:55.680 any material size because you're too
01:02:57.359 distracted pick again do whatever you
01:03:00.000 want but I'm just saying these are these
01:03:01.960 are the most common ones and then
01:03:04.119 finally we've got no data Daddy all
01:03:07.599 right no data Papa so with no data daddy
01:03:10.799 the issue is you don't even know what
01:03:12.880 your problem is because you don't
01:03:14.480 collect any data and so it'd be like hey
01:03:17.520 what you know what do we need to grow
01:03:18.720 what's our lead cost no idea what's our
01:03:20.440 close rate no idea what's our what's our
01:03:22.520 what's our turn no idea well you can't
01:03:24.200 really do much if you have no idea
01:03:25.400 what's going on on and so this then
01:03:27.119 becomes the constraint of the business
01:03:28.760 which is we need to start collecting
01:03:29.960 data now to be clear the first five have
01:03:32.839 what I consider an impossible scenario
01:03:34.520 there's some some cost the cost here is
01:03:36.920 that you give up a business the cost
01:03:38.599 here is that you have to cut you have to
01:03:40.200 prune things or you have to hire someone
01:03:41.400 and hurt your own income here the issu
01:03:43.119 is that you have to say no to customers
01:03:44.839 that you're currently making money from
01:03:46.520 here the issue is that you have to say
01:03:48.680 no to employees you're currently
01:03:49.920 overcompensating here you have to turn
01:03:52.119 down customers at a lower price and have
01:03:54.000 and hear no more often those are the
01:03:55.760 short-term cost but the one big risk of
01:03:57.599 all is that is that your business isn't
01:03:58.839 going to grow and you've been stuck for
01:04:00.119 long enough to know it's already not
01:04:01.160 happening and there's not going to be a
01:04:02.200 silver bullet you got to confront this
01:04:04.119 the no data daty issue is just hey silly
01:04:06.520 pants get your data then you'll actually
01:04:08.960 be able to grow now there's no downside
01:04:10.720 to this one the only downside here is
01:04:12.440 that you've got some shiny object that
01:04:13.559 you think is really really sexy and
01:04:15.039 interesting and you don't get to do that
01:04:17.039 because you need to do this so do this
01:04:19.160 first and I'll give you a really useful
01:04:22.119 razor for how to think about what data
01:04:25.240 to collect to collect all right so the
01:04:27.920 easiest test for is this data valuable
01:04:30.599 is when it changes so that's a Delta so
01:04:32.920 if it goes up or it goes down does it
01:04:36.039 change that's another Delta Behavior so
01:04:39.920 if we track our views on a social media
01:04:43.319 channel if the views go up does it
01:04:44.920 change what we do if the views go down
01:04:46.640 does it change what we do if the answer
01:04:48.319 is no then we don't need to track it
01:04:49.960 because you can track unlimited
01:04:51.960 variables in the world like you can
01:04:53.039 track the temperature of the room when
01:04:54.760 when people are walking in you could
01:04:56.200 track it but will it change your
01:04:57.680 behavior you can also reverse engineer
01:04:59.880 into what are the behaviors we do what
01:05:02.119 data affects it and those are the only
01:05:03.760 pieces of data that you need to track so
01:05:05.640 my biggest personal growth lesson of the
01:05:07.480 year so I give you all the portfolio
01:05:08.839 growth things but my number one
01:05:12.400 was
01:05:13.920 Rush is
01:05:16.520 imaginary now I just gave you that whole
01:05:18.599 speech on urgency but one of the things
01:05:21.640 that is that I've had to learn is my
01:05:24.119 biggest mistakes have been sh object or
01:05:26.440 woman in the red dress and
01:05:28.000 overextension and so I have these
01:05:30.799 arbitrary goals that I set for myself
01:05:32.520 that I never say out loud that I think
01:05:33.880 about every day that mean nothing to no
01:05:35.720 one and then I try and force everything
01:05:38.039 to happen on this arbitrary timeline
01:05:39.720 that I made up and then I'm upset when
01:05:41.599 people who don't know my arbitrary
01:05:43.000 timeline fall short of the speed that I
01:05:46.160 wanted to happen even though I made it
01:05:47.920 up to begin with and so Leila gave me
01:05:51.359 this Frame that I alluded to briefly
01:05:53.319 earlier but it's probably been I would
01:05:55.960 say Talent focus and this is a subset of
01:05:59.200 focus but it's missed
01:06:02.760 opportunities is less than
01:06:05.839 problems so what I mean by that is that
01:06:08.720 the opportunities that you're looking
01:06:10.240 for are in the problems that you need to
01:06:12.319 solve and me understanding this i' I've
01:06:14.720 repeated it because it's it's really
01:06:16.119 been singed into my brain there are for
01:06:19.160 example if you're starting to get low
01:06:20.480 reviews these are things that threaten
01:06:22.000 the livelihood of the business that is a
01:06:23.680 problem if you're not doing email follow
01:06:25.559 follow up that is a missed opportunity
01:06:27.240 and unless your call it payback rate or
01:06:29.599 your LTV or some sort of conversion
01:06:31.720 mechanism is the risk of the business
01:06:34.319 then that would be a missed opportunity
01:06:35.640 if if the if the number one risk in the
01:06:37.000 business right now is that like you
01:06:37.880 can't make money because you aren't
01:06:39.760 converting a higher percentage of leads
01:06:41.240 then that would shift into a problem
01:06:42.799 it's not that like any specific thing is
01:06:44.880 one or the other it's recognizing
01:06:47.079 contextually within your business is
01:06:49.079 this something that would be nice to do
01:06:52.680 or is this something that we must do in
01:06:55.160 order for us to achieve our ultimate
01:06:57.119 goal we might be able to achieve our
01:06:58.480 ultimate goal without doing email
01:06:59.880 followup if our product sucks we will
01:07:02.000 never achieve our ultimate goal and so
01:07:03.960 it's understanding the order of
01:07:05.400 magnitude or the importance of the
01:07:08.000 potential tasks that you have the reason
01:07:09.960 that this stressed me out for so long
01:07:12.359 and this is the big one is that problems
01:07:14.160 in your business are actually finite you
01:07:15.839 can list all the number of problems in
01:07:17.279 your business by and large missed
01:07:19.920 opportunities are infinite I would look
01:07:21.920 at the world of all the things that we
01:07:23.319 could do and here's the thing is the
01:07:24.520 better you get at business the more
01:07:25.720 things you know you should be doing that
01:07:26.880 you aren't and you see this huge
01:07:29.119 unlimited potential options of things
01:07:30.920 and you look at these tiny little
01:07:32.160 resources that you have and then it's
01:07:34.400 like we need to do all of these things
01:07:36.760 and this is where you stress out your
01:07:38.240 team and you stress out yourself for
01:07:39.799 literally no reason it's been difficult
01:07:41.880 for me and it's been a discipline now to
01:07:44.559 ask myself first when I want something
01:07:46.200 to happen is this a missed opportunity
01:07:48.240 or is this a problem and nine times out
01:07:51.160 a 10 it's a missed opportunity and so
01:07:53.400 I've been doubling down on problems and
01:07:55.520 solving those the thing is is that
01:07:56.760 problems are typically not nearly as fun
01:07:58.520 as missed opportunities because missed
01:07:59.880 opportunities have all the new gloss on
01:08:01.799 them they're they're they're still in
01:08:03.079 the wrapping paper you're like oh my God
01:08:04.839 this is going to be amazing but as soon
01:08:06.520 as you get into it you're like ah
01:08:07.599 there's problems here too and then and
01:08:09.880 I've said this before but what ends up
01:08:11.680 happening is when you have this Miss
01:08:13.079 opportunity bug you you start building
01:08:15.319 all of these half-built Bridges right
01:08:17.759 you never actually get all the way
01:08:18.920 across you've got a dollar here but
01:08:20.520 you're standing on this side of the land
01:08:22.520 right and you need to get this dollar
01:08:23.839 across and you start building and then
01:08:25.560 and then you find out that there's
01:08:26.600 problems and then you're like oh no so
01:08:28.679 you know what I'm going to do I'm going
01:08:29.520 to build a second bridge and then you
01:08:30.880 find out that there's problems and
01:08:32.479 you're like oh no I hate problems I'm
01:08:34.399 going to go find another one that
01:08:35.679 doesn't have problems that immediately
01:08:36.799 just makes me more money but there's
01:08:38.198 always problems there's always problems
01:08:40.158 and so it's like I have to just use the
01:08:41.759 problems and I've got to stitch this
01:08:43.479 thing together so that I can get the
01:08:45.158 dollar all the way across and then into
01:08:47.520 my very large pocket and so here's the
01:08:49.960 difficult part of this for an
01:08:50.920 entrepreneur is that when you whatever
01:08:53.000 when you quit your job when you started
01:08:54.198 this business you were very reinforced
01:08:55.960 for pursuing a missed opportunity you
01:08:58.158 weren't doing this thing you start this
01:08:59.920 business and you get rewarded for doing
01:09:01.640 it and the problem is is that you need
01:09:03.520 to unlearn that behavior because it's a
01:09:05.600 behavior that you only want to do once
01:09:07.000 when you start your business and then
01:09:08.158 every time after that you have to
01:09:09.759 confront you have to endure you have to
01:09:12.359 stick through the problem and see it to
01:09:14.279 its natural end you have to get it all
01:09:16.198 the way there so the dollars can make it
01:09:18.479 across the bridge or you'll just have
01:09:21.080 spent all the resources all the
01:09:23.080 distraction to build and reinforce this
01:09:25.040 thing that actually results in nothing
01:09:27.080 and so this has been probably my my
01:09:29.359 single biggest tier of lesson because
01:09:32.759 this is a subset of focus for me
01:09:35.198 specifically but I ask is this a missed
01:09:38.158 opportunity or is this a problem and if
01:09:40.399 it's a problem then I need to solve it
01:09:42.479 and I just need to confront and a lot of
01:09:43.920 the problems are things that you don't
01:09:45.000 know how to solve yet that's why they're
01:09:46.600 still unsolved and so you have to become
01:09:48.399 comfortable in enduring the the failure
01:09:51.279 of working with limited information or
01:09:54.198 incomplete information because the
01:09:56.480 reality of businesses is that you will
01:09:57.960 almost always not have enough
01:09:59.560 information to know perfectly whether
01:10:02.040 this is the right call and so you have
01:10:03.880 to be comfortable in ambiguity you have
01:10:07.040 to be comfortable with incomplete data
01:10:08.840 sets and still making the call because
01:10:10.920 when you have a complete data set
01:10:12.400 there's really no stress the answer is
01:10:14.159 obvious because you have the data it's
01:10:15.520 all the times where you're like oh well
01:10:17.199 I wish I had tracked that one thing that
01:10:18.880 I didn't know is going to be important
01:10:20.080 now and I can't go back 6 months to get
01:10:21.600 it that happens all the time and you
01:10:23.800 just got to be able to make the call
01:10:25.320 because the thing is is that we have
01:10:26.440 this fear that we're leaving money on
01:10:29.159 the table right we feel like this missed
01:10:31.560 opportunity right here we're like man
01:10:33.440 there's so much money on the table but
01:10:35.440 the real money on the
01:10:38.199 table sits in the problems that you know
01:10:40.880 you should be solving but
01:10:43.239 aren't and so once I realize that the
01:10:45.800 problems are the things that I need to
01:10:46.840 be solving then I can deploy all of the
01:10:49.360 resources that I normally would use to
01:10:51.199 distract myself to reinforce this bridge
01:10:53.120 and reinforce this bridge and reinforce
01:10:54.679 this bridge before I've made a dollar go
01:10:56.560 across and then point all of those
01:10:58.400 resources to one this big dollar sign so
01:11:00.600 I can go put it into my pocket and
01:11:02.080 actually solve it and so the compounding
01:11:04.239 that occurs in business happens from
01:11:05.960 Focus it's from doing one or two things
01:11:08.840 exceptionally well not doing many things
01:11:11.600 mediocre and missed opportunities are
01:11:14.120 the gateway drug to mediocrity and how I
01:11:17.280 how I deal with this emotionally is I
01:11:20.280 have a big list of Alex's big money
01:11:22.920 ideas and I've done this at very
01:11:24.520 different times in my life life like
01:11:26.159 when I know what we need to do and we
01:11:27.560 just have to keep doing more of it and
01:11:29.239 the thing is is like you probably know
01:11:30.920 this too and yet you have this this this
01:11:33.760 need for novelty right I get it believe
01:11:36.679 me and so what I do is I add this idea
01:11:40.040 to my big money list and then when we do
01:11:43.000 have bandwidth I say what one big thing
01:11:45.400 on this big money list are we going to
01:11:46.880 attack what's crazy is I I'm like I've
01:11:48.440 got a h 100 ideas on this list and then
01:11:51.120 it's a fun problem for you to be like
01:11:52.520 okay which of these things is the
01:11:54.800 biggest thing that will get us the
01:11:56.360 furthest and what's crazy is and if you
01:11:58.520 actually do this I have found so many
01:12:00.280 times that I'm in love with an idea and
01:12:02.520 then a month later two months later I
01:12:04.120 look at that idea on the list and I'm
01:12:05.400 like I can't even believe I was so into
01:12:06.760 that right and the thing is is that if
01:12:08.560 you don't have that discipline you don't
01:12:09.679 just write on it you don't let it you
01:12:10.840 don't let it let it marinate for a
01:12:12.280 little bit sometimes you end up
01:12:13.639 deploying all these resources into
01:12:14.800 something that you a month or two later
01:12:16.199 would be like I don't even know why I
01:12:17.239 did that and if you're if this is
01:12:18.600 resonating with you right now then do
01:12:21.440 more of this put more of the ideas on a
01:12:23.880 big idea list and then just let it cook
01:12:25.400 and don't tell anybody cuz you have this
01:12:27.120 need to share you have this need to talk
01:12:28.520 the idea out loud I get it I do it just
01:12:31.159 write out as much as you need to there
01:12:33.280 and then it's like you get you get it
01:12:34.320 out of your head so you didn't have to
01:12:35.760 you got all the details and all the
01:12:36.840 craziness out and you're like I can
01:12:38.080 shove it I'll deal with it later it's
01:12:39.880 kind of like Abraham Lincoln he used to
01:12:41.280 write these letters when he's really
01:12:42.360 angry at people he'd write these huge
01:12:43.800 letters just scathing letters to these
01:12:45.440 people and then he would seal them and
01:12:47.159 then he'd put them in his desk and he
01:12:48.639 said he'd sleep on it and the next day
01:12:49.960 if he wanted to send it he could and so
01:12:51.960 his desk after years was just filled
01:12:54.320 with all these letters that he never
01:12:55.679 sent but it allowed him to get through
01:12:57.440 the moment so I want to hit on this Rush
01:13:00.280 piece CU I think this is important all
01:13:01.840 right so I'm I'm going to put these over
01:13:02.920 here to the side for a moment and Rush
01:13:05.639 is imaginary so something that I've been
01:13:07.320 thinking about is like where does this
01:13:09.080 Rush come from so fundamentally if
01:13:12.239 unless you have a network effect
01:13:14.000 business so you have a winner take all
01:13:15.520 market like you're trying to become the
01:13:18.520 Uber of whatever right there's a network
01:13:21.120 effect that one there's one winner who
01:13:22.480 will win and that's it like if you're
01:13:23.920 you're either going to be apple or going
01:13:25.199 to be Android there's no one else in the
01:13:26.480 market like you've got two spots in the
01:13:27.719 market for phone creators and that's it
01:13:29.560 that's the Monopoly right unless you're
01:13:31.440 in one of those settings which 99% of
01:13:33.520 businesses are not in that situation I
01:13:35.560 have realized that for me Rush is
01:13:37.639 actually linked to one thing which is my
01:13:40.760 competition reference point which is
01:13:42.560 fundamentally who I choose to compare
01:13:44.480 myself to and so my Rush is entirely
01:13:46.920 arbitrary because I just pick who I'm
01:13:48.639 comparing myself to now here's what's
01:13:50.600 kind of crazy do you compare yourself to
01:13:52.440 a 5-year-old do you look at a five-year
01:13:53.960 and be like what a loser they don't have
01:13:56.159 a business as big as me no of course not
01:13:58.840 right but the thing is is that why
01:14:00.679 wouldn't you compare yourself to a
01:14:01.800 5-year-old well because they haven't had
01:14:03.679 any time and because they are not
01:14:07.440 developed yet but the thing is is that
01:14:09.400 they're another human just like you and
01:14:11.400 they will eventually now like let's fast
01:14:13.120 forward 20 years now they're 25 and
01:14:15.600 let's say they're crushing it do you now
01:14:17.000 compare yourself to them why do you
01:14:18.560 compare themselves at 25 and not at 5 no
01:14:21.159 real reason because we think it's
01:14:22.880 acceptable to compete uh against that
01:14:24.760 particular ular person and so for me the
01:14:27.520 realization that Rush is entirely linked
01:14:30.000 to who I choose to compare myself to
01:14:32.080 meant that it's entirely made up in my
01:14:33.800 mind so I can just change who I compare
01:14:35.639 myself to or I could try to compare
01:14:37.239 myself less much more difficult and so
01:14:38.920 in thinking about this it's more how
01:14:41.400 does this comparison change what I do
01:14:43.800 every day and if it changes my actions
01:14:46.679 that decreases the likelihood that I
01:14:48.159 achieve my long-term goals then these
01:14:50.040 comparisons hurt me and so the question
01:14:52.719 that follows from the comparisons is how
01:14:54.520 does this serve me and if it doesn't
01:14:56.920 then why do it like do you feel guilty
01:14:59.199 in middle school that you aren't the
01:15:00.320 richest person in the world well then
01:15:01.719 why do you feel guilty at 30 I'm not
01:15:03.679 saying that's my my goal in life it's
01:15:05.440 not but like fundamentally you don't
01:15:08.120 like you don't like flipping roles when
01:15:09.840 you're in Middle School do you feel like
01:15:11.199 a loser because you're not making money
01:15:12.679 maybe a couple people right but y'all
01:15:14.400 are weird right but most people in
01:15:16.120 middle school you're like oh my God I
01:15:17.719 have you know I'm getting chest hair or
01:15:19.239 whatever the hell right you're like I'm
01:15:20.840 navigating life right now like I'm a
01:15:22.480 child look at my limbs they're longer
01:15:24.080 right and so
01:15:25.480 the thing is is that we just choose to
01:15:28.080 enter this comparison game but we're all
01:15:31.000 going to die and all of our stuff's
01:15:33.000 going to go right back into the middle
01:15:34.320 and other people are going to play with
01:15:35.400 our chips so who cares and if this Rush
01:15:38.080 is is impacting your business then you
01:15:40.199 need to find a way to quell it which is
01:15:43.040 either stop comparing change your
01:15:45.159 compare yourself to now a third door is
01:15:47.760 to compare yourself to Your Heroes at
01:15:49.679 that stage in their lives right which is
01:15:51.480 where was Warren Buffett at age 35 okay
01:15:53.800 am I on track with him but again you're
01:15:56.600 not going to be Warren Buffett because
01:15:58.320 Warren Buffett lived through the
01:15:59.400 greatest growth in in American history
01:16:01.040 and was B born at the perfect time right
01:16:03.000 and he also bought his first stock when
01:16:04.159 he was seven did you buy your first
01:16:05.360 stock when you were seven no there goes
01:16:07.280 there goes my 5-year-old analogy so if
01:16:09.159 you didn't buy your first stock when you
01:16:10.199 were seven you're not wor buff it now
01:16:11.679 you can model his behavior to have
01:16:13.320 outcomes that will be probably
01:16:14.440 proportionately smaller than his but
01:16:16.880 that's okay it's only a problem if you
01:16:18.679 think it's a problem so the next big
01:16:20.360 category of kind of growth Trends or
01:16:22.280 Focus for the year of 2025 my big
01:16:24.320 lessons was was branding so I talk about
01:16:26.320 branding a lot and that's because it's
01:16:27.840 really important but I I had a one day
01:16:30.719 where I spent with uh Ben Francis so he
01:16:33.040 came out to Vegas for the Olympia and
01:16:34.360 then we spent the day together came a
01:16:35.480 day early which is great and we just
01:16:36.679 hung out and NL Mack who's his head of
01:16:38.960 uh brand was there with him and we got
01:16:42.280 to spend a wonderful time talking about
01:16:44.159 Brandon General and they told me this
01:16:46.480 story that has really stuck with me I
01:16:49.080 got to actually connect through them
01:16:50.719 with the CMO of New Balance and so this
01:16:52.639 is the story new balance is CMO they're
01:16:54.920 both had plateaued after a number of
01:16:56.639 years and so they were kind of stagnant
01:16:58.800 and they needed to shake things up so he
01:17:00.320 became the CMO of everything and he went
01:17:02.040 to the CEO and said hey can I just swing
01:17:03.560 really big and the CEO said sure and so
01:17:06.719 then he said I want to take our spend
01:17:11.280 which right now is 70% bottom of funnel
01:17:15.000 and 30% top of funnel and I want to flip
01:17:18.239 these two things I want to make 30%
01:17:21.159 bottom and 70% top and you like what
01:17:23.480 does that mean this is is brand
01:17:26.120 awareness storytelling associations that
01:17:29.719 you make with different athletes that is
01:17:33.159 all top of funnel like wow new balance
01:17:36.840 is cool right the bottom of funnel stuff
01:17:39.600 is buy shoes right and so after doing
01:17:44.639 this what was crazy is that for the
01:17:46.360 first 18 months they made less money and
01:17:49.679 so the company's return on their
01:17:52.360 advertising budget went down for 18
01:17:56.080 months but on month 19 it went like this
01:18:01.120 Boop it started going up and then it
01:18:03.280 went up even more and then it went up
01:18:04.840 even more and so they've had this
01:18:06.480 massive rebirth from this shift and
01:18:09.120 strategy and so when I heard that story
01:18:11.880 it was really compelling for a number of
01:18:13.360 reasons for me and it changed my
01:18:14.880 behavior so number one was this is a
01:18:17.560 good ratio to think about in terms of
01:18:20.199 investing in an audience versus kind of
01:18:22.199 withdrawing from the audience and the
01:18:23.560 reason the 7030 I found interesting is
01:18:26.000 that in the $100 million leads book I
01:18:27.840 talk about this at length but there's
01:18:29.560 been a there's been a a 3:1 ratio that's
01:18:33.199 been studied by television it's been
01:18:34.840 studied by radio which is
01:18:37.560 content right to ads so if you're on
01:18:41.679 your Facebook Newsfeed and you scroll
01:18:43.840 every three posts the fourth post will
01:18:46.199 be an ad all right if you're on YouTube
01:18:48.760 it might be number of minutes now they
01:18:50.239 have ai and all this stuff but for the
01:18:51.920 the typical one it's a 3:1 ratio now
01:18:54.159 this ratio is what is required to
01:18:56.840 basically keep a brand keep a Channel
01:18:59.120 people keep coming back now if they
01:19:00.840 change this to two to1 all of a sudden
01:19:02.239 people stop watching that channel they
01:19:03.719 stop watch they switch to something else
01:19:05.480 right and so that ratio being reflected
01:19:08.120 here I see as a human thing and so I
01:19:10.080 think to myself okay I need to make sure
01:19:12.800 that I always keep my ratio at least 3
01:19:15.320 to one in terms of value driven and now
01:19:18.520 you can think about this in terms of
01:19:19.920 views like Impressions per person cuz
01:19:22.719 that's what would really matter or you
01:19:23.800 can think about this in dollar spend if
01:19:25.199 you want to think about it from a
01:19:26.000 budgeting perspective but for me I think
01:19:28.560 about this at the individual level I
01:19:30.400 want to make sure that someone's getting
01:19:31.719 at least three or four positives from
01:19:34.080 any kind before they have any kind of
01:19:36.000 ask for me to do something now the netn
01:19:38.159 net world is that if your product is
01:19:41.159 exceptional the ask is not an ask
01:19:44.040 because they're excited to buy something
01:19:45.880 else from you and so this is why brand
01:19:48.760 and product longterm are interwoven
01:19:51.840 together your reputation with somebody
01:19:54.719 will be reinforced or diminished by the
01:19:57.159 quality of the product because you make
01:19:59.000 a promise with your advertisement and
01:20:00.639 you deliver on that promise or overd
01:20:02.360 deliver on their promise with the
01:20:03.960 product and if it's worse now you got to
01:20:06.080 put more in the bucket here to kind of
01:20:08.000 like get them to be willing to take
01:20:09.600 another shot with you again or if you
01:20:12.480 have a really good product the amount
01:20:13.880 that you have to put back in here is
01:20:15.040 actually less you could sell something
01:20:17.040 else even faster so if Apple came out
01:20:20.159 with the next iPod right people would be
01:20:22.600 really excited about it and if the next
01:20:24.080 day they said hey we also have this
01:20:27.199 other amazing thing that doesn't
01:20:29.159 necessarily compete with the iPod as
01:20:31.120 long as you had the money which is a
01:20:32.679 different question as long as you had
01:20:33.639 the money or financing available you'd
01:20:35.639 be excited to buy the next thing too
01:20:37.199 provided the first thing was awesome and
01:20:38.719 so this is the idea is that products can
01:20:40.960 reinforce brand and should be the thing
01:20:42.719 that reinforc brand over the long term
01:20:44.000 which is why I want everybody to read my
01:20:46.360 books first because the books have been
01:20:48.239 the the pieces of content that I put
01:20:49.920 more single time in than anything else I
01:20:52.320 put 2,000 plus hours in each of those
01:20:54.080 books like no joke 2,000 plus hours and
01:20:57.120 so they are the single best pieces of
01:20:58.520 content that I will likely ever make and
01:21:00.320 they will outlive me these videos will
01:21:02.280 go away like podcasts will disappear but
01:21:05.159 the books will remain that is why I want
01:21:07.040 everyone to read them which is why I've
01:21:08.360 made them free like you can listen to
01:21:10.000 them on my podcast for free and if you
01:21:11.480 like hard versions you go on my site or
01:21:13.440 you go on Amazon you can grab them all
01:21:14.880 right uh they have you know 26,000 five
01:21:17.360 stars there's a million copies that have
01:21:18.840 been sold and it's because they're good
01:21:20.719 right it's and and and it's because I
01:21:22.040 put so much time into them and so this
01:21:24.320 lesson
01:21:25.239 first off was important for me because
01:21:26.639 the ratio and it corroborated what we
01:21:28.400 what I kind of already think about in
01:21:29.600 terms of content in giving to asking the
01:21:31.760 other piece that I thought was really
01:21:32.960 interesting was the time delay which is
01:21:35.199 that he made this shift and then he had
01:21:36.920 to wait a year and a half and that's
01:21:38.239 given the size budget New Balance has
01:21:40.400 which means that if you want to build a
01:21:41.639 brand you've got to expect you got to
01:21:43.080 measure in years you're not going to
01:21:44.440 build a brand in months it's just not
01:21:45.520 going to happen people see my brand now
01:21:47.320 but like my first YouTube videos also
01:21:49.199 started at zero my first Facebook page
01:21:51.280 started at zero like everyone not my
01:21:52.480 first Instagram started like at zero
01:21:53.760 like everybody else and so it just takes
01:21:55.840 time like my first YouTube videos I
01:21:57.400 think was 2019 right and so like don't
01:21:59.639 expect to have a 10-year outcome in 12
01:22:01.360 months one of the questions that I ask
01:22:03.360 myself is like okay for Branding for cpg
01:22:06.920 companies so for companies that sell to
01:22:08.280 Consumers dirting consumer The Branding
01:22:10.280 Playbook is very well tested right you
01:22:13.880 go find uh influencers in that world or
01:22:16.480 brands that are similar you do
01:22:17.840 collaborations with them you basically
01:22:19.960 cross over on values their values become
01:22:22.000 similar to yours you kind of rub off on
01:22:23.320 one another you go find Champions and
01:22:25.080 athletes that are top of their field you
01:22:26.920 make the associations people then want
01:22:28.840 to buy your product because of that
01:22:30.159 associate and the history of positive
01:22:32.080 reinforc they had with that particular
01:22:33.520 athlete okay now I was like how do I do
01:22:36.320 this in a B2B setting right and so I
01:22:39.120 have split this up into basically two
01:22:41.080 major categories if I want to build a
01:22:44.000 brand in a B2B setting right you
01:22:46.719 typically want to educate your audience
01:22:48.360 because you want to be positioned as an
01:22:49.400 authority so if you're an accountant
01:22:50.480 you're a lawyer whatever it is you want
01:22:52.400 to be known as somebody who knows what
01:22:53.560 they're doing right and so category one
01:22:56.480 is you help them accomplish their goals
01:23:00.800 for
01:23:01.639 free very simple so a lot of this is
01:23:04.120 going to be content right like this is
01:23:05.719 why we brand with content is that if you
01:23:08.040 like what's the most positive
01:23:09.120 Association someone can have they have a
01:23:10.360 goal you help them achieve it okay so
01:23:12.280 they will link their goal achievement to
01:23:14.320 your help great the next thing is that
01:23:17.320 you help someone like them so it's an
01:23:19.280 approximation which is okay I am a
01:23:22.040 lawyer and I help someone negotiate some
01:23:24.159 deal
01:23:25.080 and that person and I and I have to
01:23:27.440 advertise it I have to let people know
01:23:28.639 about it but me seeing that as a plumber
01:23:31.600 and this lawyer only helps plumbers
01:23:33.080 negotiate these deals I say oh someone
01:23:34.840 just like me got exactly what I want so
01:23:36.600 this is a degree
01:23:38.280 removed the next one is that you do the
01:23:40.880 aspirational outcome yourself now both
01:23:42.360 of these can be aspirational to be clear
01:23:44.159 and this was actually something that Ben
01:23:46.239 and I talked about a lot Ben Francis
01:23:48.320 which was often times brands are built
01:23:51.040 on the aspirational because it's almost
01:23:53.760 like an extreme version that I translate
01:23:56.280 into decreasing risk of purchase so let
01:23:58.239 me explain so Northface can help people
01:24:02.440 get to Everest and so if it's really
01:24:04.480 cold at the top of Everest if I buy that
01:24:06.719 jacket it will likely keep me warm on
01:24:08.920 the way to work from my car to the door
01:24:11.600 if Range Rover makes an ultimate outdoor
01:24:14.719 vehicle and that they're the off
01:24:16.639 ultimate off-roader then it'll probably
01:24:19.000 help me if I have to get over a curb
01:24:21.239 right it's these extreme versions that
01:24:23.159 get regressed down to well if it can do
01:24:25.080 that then it'll probably help me with my
01:24:26.719 thing right seum is the best fitness
01:24:29.880 influencer right now in this generation
01:24:32.120 and so if he wears this stuff to compete
01:24:35.280 at the Olympia and train for the Olympia
01:24:38.000 then for me to just trying to be the
01:24:39.480 strongest guy at my gym it'll probably
01:24:41.480 work for me and so the question is what
01:24:43.400 is that aspirational outcome like Red
01:24:45.239 Bull if I could iy could drink the Red
01:24:46.920 Bull and jump out of space then it'll
01:24:48.840 probably get me a little bit motivated
01:24:50.560 when I have 5 hours of sleep right like
01:24:52.920 you notice the theme here like all of
01:24:54.639 these brands have these big aspirational
01:24:56.520 outcomes there's a reason that my brand
01:24:58.560 grew when I had a $46 million exit
01:25:01.199 because it was an aspirational outcome
01:25:03.159 now what I'm trying to do now and I've
01:25:04.480 been public about that is cross a
01:25:06.040 billion dollars like that's the goal and
01:25:07.440 when that occurs my brand will be
01:25:09.040 reinforced it'll be strengthened because
01:25:10.800 it'll be an aspirational goal for more
01:25:12.719 people now the good news is a $50
01:25:14.840 million exit or $46 million exit is a
01:25:17.920 good enough occurrence for many people
01:25:20.119 now a different aspirational thing might
01:25:21.800 be our portfolio performance now we're
01:25:23.880 worth significantly more than when we
01:25:25.360 had that exit but it's less validated
01:25:27.840 it's less thirdparty signed off and when
01:25:30.320 we have that sign off it'll become
01:25:31.639 validated I'll give you a fun story on
01:25:33.040 this the amount of people that gave me
01:25:35.760 kudos for selling gym launch was
01:25:38.920 significantly more than the people who
01:25:40.119 gave me kudos for owning gym launch but
01:25:42.600 the owning of gym launch I was richer
01:25:44.920 the day before I sold the company than
01:25:47.000 the day after because the equity in the
01:25:49.360 business compounded taxfree and the
01:25:51.920 moment I sold it I had to pay taxes on
01:25:54.440 what I gained and so by definition I had
01:25:56.560 less money after the transaction than
01:25:59.000 before but everyone perceived it because
01:26:01.040 there was the third party edification
01:26:02.560 that occurred because the third party at
01:26:03.880 arms length made the transaction happen
01:26:05.719 and so it was real but as long as you
01:26:07.280 don't live in the minds of other
01:26:08.560 people's perceptions which to be fair in
01:26:10.320 branding you kind of do you don't want
01:26:11.800 your selfworth to be tied in their
01:26:13.400 perception but your brand ultimately
01:26:14.880 will be and so the idea is the question
01:26:17.560 to answer if you're a B2B business and
01:26:20.040 you're trying which is over half of
01:26:21.560 businesses are B2B fun dead I didn't
01:26:23.199 know I was looking this up for school
01:26:25.000 actually is that these are basically
01:26:26.560 your buckets is how do I help them do
01:26:29.000 what they want how do I help people like
01:26:31.000 them and how can I accomplish something
01:26:33.560 aspirational in their mind or help other
01:26:35.360 people like them accomplish that
01:26:36.520 aspirational thing and this is where
01:26:38.040 like you can help them accomplish their
01:26:39.239 goals or the aspirational goal it's
01:26:40.840 either of those things but the
01:26:42.199 aspirational one I find incredibly
01:26:43.600 interesting because some people saw the
01:26:45.280 book launch last year uh for the $100
01:26:47.560 million leads we had a gazillion people
01:26:49.119 there live it was awesome and they were
01:26:51.159 like I would like to do something like
01:26:52.960 that and so that in of itself was a
01:26:55.040 brand reinforcing event and so big
01:26:57.679 picture this is what I see as the
01:27:00.000 process for building AB Tob brand
01:27:02.920 because it's not like you're going to
01:27:04.800 like think about like this if you're the
01:27:06.119 if you're an attorney you're not going
01:27:07.320 to sign the top attorney you know O.J
01:27:09.360 Simpson's attorney I can't remember it's
01:27:10.560 the Kardashians X I can't remember what
01:27:12.119 Jenner anyways no that's Bruce Jenner
01:27:14.400 forget about it you get the idea is that
01:27:16.239 like if you a business person then it's
01:27:18.719 like elon's not going to endorse you
01:27:20.440 right it's not going to happen and so
01:27:21.679 it's like you have to do the other
01:27:23.159 things that Cano proximate your
01:27:25.199 proficiency with proof and so the final
01:27:28.320 T tldr of this is you have resources
01:27:31.800 this is what your brand must accomplish
01:27:34.000 this is the timeline that it has to go
01:27:36.000 off of this is the ratio you need to
01:27:38.040 follow and this is how you spend your
01:27:39.920 money in time to make these things
01:27:43.280 happen for the
01:27:44.560 audience and that's how you do it and so
01:27:46.719 this has been my focus uh one of the big
01:27:48.840 kind of like crystallizations of
01:27:50.159 knowledge maybe deepened uh my
01:27:52.199 understanding of branding and how it
01:27:53.119 translates back into forth between D Toc
01:27:55.560 and B2B shiron Sasa good friend of Leila
01:27:58.239 n currently the the CEO of real also has
01:28:00.360 sillo Capital which is his his uh
01:28:02.480 investment firm he gave me this little
01:28:04.119 quip that I really like and he said
01:28:06.520 Talent only gets better in the future
01:28:10.400 and that has been I mean you'll notice a
01:28:12.639 common theme around people in this and
01:28:14.280 that's because when I look at the things
01:28:15.600 that we did really well with this year
01:28:17.320 is bring good people in get bad people
01:28:19.239 out and the companies that did the best
01:28:20.560 Mor folio like that that strategy rank
01:28:22.840 fruit like the the the the the highest
01:28:24.320 performing company the portfolio we put
01:28:25.920 in probably like six great leaders and
01:28:28.400 it's just crushing and that that's not
01:28:30.800 an accident right so that's thing number
01:28:33.520 one in terms of talent the second thing
01:28:36.000 is work with the people who move towards
01:28:38.400 you and so I have spent too much time in
01:28:42.119 my life trying to sell people on why
01:28:45.400 they should do things my way or with my
01:28:48.440 values or with my kind of rules which I
01:28:50.920 Define culture as rules of reinforcement
01:28:52.920 in a business so like these are the
01:28:54.800 rules of the game as I would like to
01:28:56.119 play it and I noticed that if I kind of
01:29:00.119 have this like kind of recurring
01:29:01.560 conflict with a handful of people I was
01:29:04.280 like I don't need to do this like
01:29:06.360 there's another person who is stoked to
01:29:08.880 be here will agree with the path and
01:29:12.400 it'll be so much more efficient because
01:29:14.239 they'll want to talk to me I want to
01:29:15.560 talk to them we agree to the rules of
01:29:17.360 the game the way we both want to play it
01:29:19.280 and so we'll just play that much better
01:29:20.679 that much longer and so this is more of
01:29:23.000 like a warning shot because I think what
01:29:24.400 happens is you habituate especially if
01:29:26.760 you're an entrepreneur you have a high
01:29:27.719 pain tolerance like you're used to like
01:29:29.239 you're used to suffering suffering is
01:29:30.639 just the the current state and so
01:29:32.679 sometimes someone comes in things are
01:29:34.480 okay sometimes they change sometimes you
01:29:35.920 change whatever but fundamentally
01:29:38.639 conflict emerges and if you cannot
01:29:40.719 resolve the conflict then over time your
01:29:43.760 communication cycle lessens and lessons
01:29:45.360 you start talking less and less
01:29:46.440 frequently and if this person is close
01:29:48.800 to you or close to your function it
01:29:50.800 becomes very difficult to basically for
01:29:52.880 them to do their job and for you you to
01:29:54.400 get what you need out of the role and so
01:29:57.080 um my my single line of advice is work
01:29:59.760 with the people who move towards you and
01:30:01.560 so a a correlat second point of that
01:30:03.639 that's a different frame to Think
01:30:04.880 Through is if your team doesn't admire
01:30:07.320 some aspects of you you either have to
01:30:09.320 change them or you have to change you
01:30:12.000 like this is a tough one though because
01:30:14.320 you want like this is my opinion if your
01:30:16.520 team doesn't admire certain things about
01:30:18.320 you then the likely that you have strong
01:30:20.320 influence over their behavior outside of
01:30:22.159 basically punishment is low and it's
01:30:24.880 much better in my opinion to have a team
01:30:26.560 who admire different traits of yours now
01:30:28.320 they don't have to say everything you do
01:30:29.800 is amazing but like there are there
01:30:31.960 skills you have there are behaviors you
01:30:33.880 do that they're like man it'd be really
01:30:35.600 cool if I had that or it's really cool
01:30:37.000 that he has that or she has that and
01:30:39.239 that creates this element of respect in
01:30:41.320 the relationship that I think is really
01:30:43.440 required for high performance and you
01:30:46.199 have two choices there like either you
01:30:48.080 change or they change or you get someone
01:30:50.600 else so you change the whole thing right
01:30:52.239 I think making sure that you've
01:30:53.440 established rules of the game and just
01:30:55.320 subtly noticing like is there someone
01:30:57.560 who just like disrespects you on a
01:30:59.360 regular basis or they tried or they're
01:31:00.880 the first one to disagree I want to be
01:31:02.960 clear here I'm not saying that you
01:31:04.639 shouldn't have healthy tension and
01:31:06.239 disagreement at the top it's actually
01:31:07.320 very common like everybody who has like
01:31:09.480 different perspectives to yield the best
01:31:11.239 outcome like that's how you get truth so
01:31:12.960 that's that's good but if you're
01:31:15.000 consistently being blocked on what you
01:31:17.119 consider to be like par for course
01:31:19.199 behaviors that can grade on you and I
01:31:21.560 think that I tolerated that for too long
01:31:24.639 um and I have done that for for in
01:31:26.560 different occasions and I I want to
01:31:28.199 shorten the time that I tolerate those
01:31:30.679 kind of Dynamics so next up is sawdust
01:31:34.679 my favorite businesses in the world are
01:31:36.639 businesses that are started off of waste
01:31:39.119 from someone else so let me explain so I
01:31:42.360 love the Airbnb and I love Uber the way
01:31:45.199 that like people have excess capacity or
01:31:47.679 sawdust they have something that they're
01:31:49.639 not using that would be valuable for
01:31:51.119 someone else an easy example in a brick
01:31:52.920 and mortar scenario is like I don't use
01:31:54.800 my gym my gym was closed after 8:30 and
01:31:57.400 it was no one used it until 4:30 in the
01:31:59.840 morning and so I'm paying for this rent
01:32:02.199 and I have this space and there's
01:32:04.159 probably some people who would like to
01:32:05.960 have that space but can't right and I
01:32:09.119 didn't have you know weekend hours ended
01:32:10.800 afternoon right and so there many of us
01:32:13.480 and Airbnb did this on the residential
01:32:15.239 side obviously like you have a spare
01:32:16.639 bedroom you can let someone crash there
01:32:17.880 and you can make money for it but the
01:32:18.920 thing is is that within businesses you
01:32:21.679 also have excess capacity you have
01:32:24.400 sawdust and so the sawdust analogy comes
01:32:26.679 from Lumber Mills when they would they
01:32:28.639 would strip the Trees of bark they would
01:32:30.320 turn them into planks and then you know
01:32:32.600 they Shi the planks out but a smart
01:32:34.639 Foreman of the factory looked on the
01:32:35.880 ground one day and they had to just keep
01:32:37.040 sweeping up all this dust from the saw
01:32:39.239 and then finally one guy said hey could
01:32:41.360 we just mix this with glue and make
01:32:43.880 Plywood And then of all of a sudden a
01:32:46.119 whole new kind of industry was born from
01:32:48.280 that where you could take the scraps and
01:32:50.119 then turn into something else and in the
01:32:52.239 fur business that I did when I was 16 17
01:32:54.520 18 in there the owner would have to make
01:32:58.560 these jackets and he would cut off these
01:33:00.159 Snippets from the Snippets he was able
01:33:02.199 to make earm muffs and then he was able
01:33:04.600 to sell his ear muffs or give the ear
01:33:05.679 muffs away as bonuses and so he was able
01:33:07.800 to make something from nothing and so
01:33:10.360 there are sawdust things that exist in
01:33:12.880 your business and I'll tell you one of
01:33:13.800 the big ones that came from acquisition.
01:33:15.360 comom so our primary business is
01:33:17.040 obviously the portfolio and that's where
01:33:19.679 the majority of our resources are
01:33:21.000 allocated towards and we tried to figure
01:33:23.600 out a way where we could meet more
01:33:26.080 potential portfolio companies so I tried
01:33:28.159 a few different things to come out well
01:33:30.119 the barrier was too low we got mixy
01:33:32.040 matchy and I was like that's not good so
01:33:33.760 we tried that one and we didn't meet
01:33:34.960 good people and I was like all right
01:33:35.840 that's not good so the next thing I did
01:33:36.920 was like okay what if we raise the
01:33:38.400 qualifications really high and then we
01:33:40.080 like kind of have these dinners so we
01:33:42.239 did we did like four or five dinners
01:33:44.400 where people would fly out we'd meet
01:33:46.000 them the whole idea for me was like I
01:33:47.199 have to eat either way so I might as
01:33:48.480 well eat with people like again like
01:33:50.400 sawdust like what do I have to I also
01:33:51.800 have to make content so if I go to
01:33:53.199 dinner I make content and I meet people
01:33:54.960 this is all good this helps us generate
01:33:56.600 deals and the reason that I was trying
01:33:58.159 to figure this out was because the best
01:33:59.560 port portfolio companies we have are
01:34:00.960 number one number two number four best
01:34:02.199 performing company were companies that
01:34:03.360 we had worked with for 6 to 12 months
01:34:04.800 prior so we had an existing relationship
01:34:06.679 we had helped them grow and then we were
01:34:08.320 like okay I think their portfolio ready
01:34:09.560 now then we made our investment and we
01:34:10.679 and we grew them from there and our best
01:34:12.040 performers were like that so I was like
01:34:13.280 how can I how can I have this happen on
01:34:14.880 purpose rather than by accident so I was
01:34:16.800 I was really struggling with this mind
01:34:18.239 you I was also like running the
01:34:19.239 portfolio too so it it's like I wasn't
01:34:20.520 putting full attention towards it and
01:34:21.840 then in January I was like okay well we
01:34:23.960 have this building and we have there's
01:34:26.320 an open open floor space there were a
01:34:28.119 bunch of desks there but I was like
01:34:29.400 weren't using those desks everybody had
01:34:31.119 offices and because we do a lot of like
01:34:32.560 confidential calls and whatnot we're
01:34:33.960 more of an office closed door setup and
01:34:35.560 so we cleared the desks and we're like
01:34:38.800 okay well let's see if some businesses
01:34:41.040 would want to fly out to our
01:34:42.440 headquarters and have us spend like two
01:34:44.800 days kind of going over how we create
01:34:46.400 value because then that way it's like it
01:34:48.159 will provide value to them and the
01:34:49.320 people who are like oh this is really
01:34:50.560 cool I would love to potentially like
01:34:52.679 follow up with them over the alol they
01:34:54.360 become they kind of enter a longer term
01:34:55.600 nurture process and we can potentially
01:34:57.159 do deals with those people Etc that's
01:34:58.440 also why we spun up acq Ventures Etc and
01:35:01.080 so that whole division of workshops came
01:35:04.600 out of we have extra space and the
01:35:07.280 portfolio team isn't fully allocated
01:35:10.119 like they work on the portfolio
01:35:11.320 obviously but like they can step down
01:35:12.920 for a day or two uh during the month to
01:35:15.159 meet other companies uh network with
01:35:17.520 them share how they are turning around
01:35:19.400 different companies in our portfolio
01:35:21.000 specific divisions or departments and
01:35:22.679 that'll be very additive like we can add
01:35:24.239 value to everyone and adds value to us
01:35:25.639 add to them and I get content from it
01:35:27.800 and so that was a big W and the reason I
01:35:30.880 bring this up is there are some things
01:35:33.000 in your business that check more than
01:35:34.840 one box and so it's like I don't want a
01:35:37.239 single box check I want like four boxes
01:35:39.880 checked and so this generates deal flow
01:35:43.760 this generates cash flow this generates
01:35:47.880 content this generates Talent flow and
01:35:51.560 so all of these things and utiliz as a
01:35:54.400 resource that I already have paid for I
01:35:56.119 already I have to pay I pay this
01:35:57.400 building every month right like this
01:35:58.840 cost exists I pay my team every month no
01:36:01.080 matter what either way and so it used an
01:36:03.119 existing cost basis to create a new
01:36:05.560 opportunity for content and deal flow
01:36:08.280 and so from that it's like if you can
01:36:09.800 just look at the pieces you have on the
01:36:11.440 board and this is actually what I do I I
01:36:13.000 try and write down with as much detail
01:36:14.840 what are all the things we do on a
01:36:16.560 regular basis like what are the calls we
01:36:18.159 take what are the conferences we attend
01:36:19.639 what are the like every single thing we
01:36:21.280 do and I'm like is there a way I can
01:36:22.600 recombine these things things into
01:36:24.199 something that would be valuable at no
01:36:26.119 cost to me and that's where I've had
01:36:28.040 these really disproportionate gains in
01:36:30.560 profitable divisions or products in our
01:36:32.600 company obviously and then within the
01:36:33.760 portfolio so for example you probably
01:36:36.360 have Sops and checklists within your
01:36:38.040 business right of how you do whatever
01:36:39.520 you do well if you can take that and
01:36:42.040 then turn those into lead magnets then
01:36:44.320 not only are they valuable for you they
01:36:46.080 also generate demand and so that's just
01:36:48.320 a very micro example of like take
01:36:50.080 something you're already doing and find
01:36:51.600 another use for it that requires no
01:36:53.080 extra work the next one's really big and
01:36:55.360 so this is a little bit looking forward
01:36:57.400 into 2025 and Beyond and so I believe
01:37:00.960 this so this is a bet so ought be clear
01:37:02.719 this is H this is me making a bet and
01:37:04.239 calling a shot so I
01:37:06.320 believe that IRL and AI exist on polar
01:37:10.400 opposite sze of a Continuum and I think
01:37:14.400 that doubling down on both of these is a
01:37:18.119 good decision and So within our
01:37:20.360 portfolio we are pushing heavily on both
01:37:23.000 sides and so postco I still feel like
01:37:26.159 there's unmet demand for people who want
01:37:28.280 to connect I mean obviously this is why
01:37:29.760 I invested in school like I believe
01:37:31.119 Community is really good and I think
01:37:32.639 it's lacking right now so I think
01:37:33.560 there's huge demand for it and we've
01:37:35.679 never we've we've never been more
01:37:37.239 connected and also feel so apart and so
01:37:40.000 it's it's almost like we have a lot of
01:37:41.880 false Solutions it's like we're eating
01:37:43.440 fake food that keeps you full but
01:37:45.000 doesn't satisfy you it's kind of like
01:37:46.639 porn to sex like it's not the real thing
01:37:49.199 right and so the idea is like this is
01:37:51.960 the real thing this is efficiency and so
01:37:55.320 it's like how can I how can I get as
01:37:57.159 much efficiency as possible so that I
01:37:59.239 can do as many of the unscalable things
01:38:01.320 that are the real thing and this IRL
01:38:04.360 push that I'm doing I'm doing across all
01:38:06.239 the portfolio companies because the
01:38:08.960 interesting thing about IRL is customers
01:38:11.560 who have in-person experiences have
01:38:13.320 tremendously different brand Affinity
01:38:15.239 they're more loyal they refer more they
01:38:17.159 rate higher they buy more often and if
01:38:19.639 you have a strong culture within your
01:38:21.760 marketing or your branding you will
01:38:23.159 attract ACT like-minded people and so
01:38:26.040 that allows you to provide them value at
01:38:29.520 no extra cost so think about like this
01:38:31.760 if I assemble a party I'm the host of
01:38:34.599 the party everybody who meets at the
01:38:36.400 party feels like the the party was
01:38:38.400 awesome if everyone else at the party
01:38:39.719 was great I could not talk to any of the
01:38:41.560 guests and have them think Alex's party
01:38:43.520 was awesome and I will get a
01:38:44.639 disproportionate amount of the reward
01:38:46.719 from the associations and the time they
01:38:48.360 had but that Network allows people who
01:38:51.800 assemble to provide value to each other
01:38:53.599 which is almost like s like you're not
01:38:55.320 you you just organize it and you let
01:38:56.840 them provide the value and so IRL and AI
01:39:01.159 I'm I'm heavily pushing on this this
01:39:02.760 year Sam Alman said that this year is
01:39:04.400 the year AGI will come out 2025 so
01:39:06.520 artificial general intelligence which
01:39:07.760 basically AI is better than everyone at
01:39:10.280 everything which is frightening but
01:39:11.560 we'll figure it out in the meantime
01:39:13.320 though it'd be great if it could take
01:39:14.239 some sales calls and uh set some
01:39:15.880 appointments uh pretty accurately so uh
01:39:18.400 and maybe help with some content and
01:39:19.800 things like that uh but in the meantime
01:39:21.400 we're staying really AB breasted on this
01:39:22.960 and we're actively kind of like I'm not
01:39:25.520 trying to be the AI company I want to be
01:39:29.239 a company that uses AI well just to be
01:39:31.360 clear about my position on this IRL
01:39:33.280 though is something that I feel like AI
01:39:35.239 will not disrupt and I think that the
01:39:37.040 demand for inperson experiences uh will
01:39:39.520 continue to rise and I think that it is
01:39:41.239 a good bet to make and so this is what
01:39:42.920 I'm betting on next year and I will
01:39:45.520 mention this because a lot of people
01:39:46.639 don't like IRL because they say it's
01:39:48.400 unscalable right but I care so much more
01:39:51.760 about is it valuable and if it's
01:39:54.000 valuable enough it's worth scaling and
01:39:57.199 so the thing is is that just because
01:39:59.000 it's harder doesn't mean it's not worth
01:40:00.280 doing and the benefit of scaling
01:40:02.760 something that is harder to scale but
01:40:04.080 also valuable means that once you scale
01:40:05.800 a little bit more you'll have more
01:40:07.199 resources to continue scaling it and so
01:40:10.000 if we can build cities in the middle of
01:40:11.760 the desert or the middle of the ocean we
01:40:13.679 can absolutely scale an in-person
01:40:15.400 experience next fun one is school so
01:40:19.440 what's crazy about this is that this was
01:40:21.119 this year uh which feels like you know
01:40:23.000 an eternity ago but we uh we negotiated
01:40:25.440 the deal in 2023 and then in January we
01:40:28.000 came out publicly with it so this was
01:40:29.760 the first brand deal that I did this
01:40:31.119 year uh or sorry the first brand I've
01:40:33.080 ever done and the main reason behind
01:40:35.239 doing it was that I believed in the
01:40:36.840 product and I believed in the team and I
01:40:39.560 thought it was the best one and I think
01:40:40.960 it's going to win and so that is why I
01:40:42.960 was willing to make that bet and to be
01:40:44.560 very clear opportunity always looks like
01:40:47.480 Risk today and this this bet has proven
01:40:51.159 out very well the platform continues to
01:40:53.000 grow like crazy we have millions and
01:40:54.560 millions of users which is awesome and
01:40:56.119 that was kind of the goal and the reason
01:40:57.800 that I I ended up betting on this versus
01:40:59.679 like any other potential thing I could
01:41:01.040 do was it felt very uniquely fit for me
01:41:06.560 so I'll explain what I mean so there's a
01:41:09.320 make money component to school there's a
01:41:12.520 education component to school there's a
01:41:15.159 community component to school which I
01:41:16.840 just see as like Plus for for social
01:41:19.400 right and then all of these together
01:41:21.760 aren't an opportunity vehicle
01:41:23.840 that is high leverage and so for those
01:41:26.320 reasons I was like I feel like I am
01:41:28.639 uniquely qualified for Education media
01:41:32.119 would be another one here there's
01:41:33.639 definitely a huge media component with
01:41:35.320 the business so it's like education
01:41:37.480 media business societal good operational
01:41:40.280 leverage this was it was like if you
01:41:42.520 could make a business that hit a lot of
01:41:44.599 the things that I'm about and for me it
01:41:47.280 also help people who are going Z to one
01:41:49.760 and I have a huge percentage of the
01:41:51.639 audience that want to start start a
01:41:53.480 business don't have one and didn't know
01:41:56.280 where to go and so I wanted to have
01:41:57.800 something that I could say if you aren't
01:41:59.440 a business owner yet this is a very easy
01:42:02.080 business to get started it's very low
01:42:04.239 risk there's not many moving Parts you
01:42:06.320 can do it without any employees you
01:42:07.760 don't have to have inventory you
01:42:09.920 literally just need to learn the basic
01:42:11.440 skills and so this is a great vehicle
01:42:13.560 for doing it and so I was super pumped
01:42:16.119 uh when we found out that the average
01:42:17.679 Community made
01:42:19.520 $1,360 per month that's paid communities
01:42:22.320 and I think that's really cool because
01:42:23.920 it's like no this isn't you're not going
01:42:25.639 to be a gazillionaire by doing this but
01:42:27.560 it can help get you started and that I
01:42:29.520 see this as a great Gateway for getting
01:42:31.320 a notch ownership as a side note for
01:42:34.000 existing businesses I think every
01:42:35.320 existing business should have like every
01:42:36.760 gym owner should have a school Community
01:42:38.639 every every realtor should have a
01:42:40.599 community for their for their customers
01:42:42.480 every HOA should have a community uh a
01:42:44.639 school Community for for their for the
01:42:46.880 the people in the neighborhood like
01:42:48.320 whatever business you have like if you
01:42:49.719 have an e-commerce business there's a
01:42:50.960 ton of e-commerce businesses joining
01:42:52.239 school right now that realize that the
01:42:54.599 email deliverability like if you can
01:42:56.320 reach 100% of people who bought your
01:42:57.840 product the feedback that you can get on
01:42:59.880 the product the reviews the likely they
01:43:01.920 buy the next thing goes way up and so
01:43:03.960 it's like sure add them to the email
01:43:05.719 list but also add them to a live
01:43:07.280 community and so I see that as again the
01:43:08.840 IRL versus AI like how do we how do we
01:43:11.599 bring people together and so we're also
01:43:13.599 doubling down on that with school
01:43:14.800 because we are not we don't see
01:43:16.239 ourselves I mean obviously it's a
01:43:17.440 technology business but like it's a
01:43:19.080 community business and so we're also
01:43:21.280 doubling down on how can we facilitate
01:43:22.880 in inperson connections between people
01:43:26.040 of similar interests so I'll I'll give
01:43:28.400 you some specific lessons that I've
01:43:30.480 learned from uh growing School
01:43:32.679 tremendously over the last year so
01:43:35.360 number one is uh
01:43:38.080 cro usually decreases hold on usually
01:43:42.040 your split test will fail and so
01:43:44.040 basically the more optimized something
01:43:45.400 is the more likely a change from optimal
01:43:47.719 results in a decrease and so our first
01:43:50.440 launch of the school games page did so
01:43:52.599 well that we've done like 14 sorry 16
01:43:54.760 major split tests and only two of them
01:43:57.040 have won and so like anything from the
01:43:59.280 like so basically the control is really
01:44:00.599 really dialed and it typically like if
01:44:02.360 you have monstrous amounts of traffic
01:44:04.760 when you incur the cost of change like
01:44:06.520 it is it is a real cost the second kind
01:44:08.679 of thing that I that I would say that
01:44:10.199 like I've learned uh or rather been
01:44:11.960 reinforced from school is kind of
01:44:14.520 customers above everything which is just
01:44:16.599 always a great reminder Paul Graham has
01:44:18.080 this statement that I probably feel like
01:44:19.280 I've said a whole bunch of times this
01:44:20.440 year which is you can solve almost every
01:44:22.480 problem in a business business by
01:44:23.480 talking to your customers more like if
01:44:25.000 your marketing isn't working talk to
01:44:26.159 your customers if your sales isn't
01:44:27.199 working talk to your customers if your
01:44:28.280 product isn't working talk to your
01:44:29.239 customers right you you are never too
01:44:31.360 big to not talk to your customers and so
01:44:34.159 that that was a big emphasis the I would
01:44:36.520 say the next one is the the the value of
01:44:39.480 offers it was just you know the school
01:44:40.960 games itself was a really cool offer
01:44:42.880 that we came up with and then we added
01:44:44.599 in um you can win a cybertruck if you if
01:44:48.000 you win which which made it even crazier
01:44:50.560 and so the the uplift that a business
01:44:53.080 can get from having a superior offer we
01:44:54.920 got to see that you know it's just it's
01:44:56.400 nice to see things proven out so that
01:44:57.960 was a really good one the next big
01:44:59.599 lesson I'll put this one this is really
01:45:00.840 big is the value of deletion and
01:45:03.760 simplicity so I'll explain what I mean
01:45:05.320 here so we have tried to make it as easy
01:45:08.080 as humanly possible for people to win on
01:45:10.480 the platform and we get better and
01:45:11.920 better every day but a big part of it is
01:45:13.880 is the number one reason people cancel
01:45:15.239 things is overwhelm and so overwhelm
01:45:17.400 translates into zero value because they
01:45:19.679 stop so what happens is people hear
01:45:21.679 overwhelm and then add more stuff and so
01:45:24.639 it's it's rare that addition improves
01:45:28.119 things rather than simply making things
01:45:30.119 better or taking something out and make
01:45:31.719 and replacing it with something better
01:45:33.360 or eliminating it all together like you
01:45:34.880 want it to be as simple as possible but
01:45:36.599 no simpler right like if you if you take
01:45:38.679 away all the friction that occurs from
01:45:41.639 using a phone what's left is an iPhone
01:45:44.599 right the only next version of that
01:45:46.280 would be you just talk in the air and
01:45:48.159 then like you get connected with people
01:45:49.920 like that would be the next version of
01:45:51.159 that but what Steve Jobs did was inorder
01:45:53.080 of magnitude Improvement off of the
01:45:54.239 existing phones and he just looked at
01:45:56.199 all the things that suck about a phone
01:45:57.400 removed all of them and what was left
01:45:58.560 was the iPhone and so thinking about
01:46:01.119 product and value this way right so the
01:46:03.320 value equation you've got the outcome
01:46:05.360 you've got the risk right you've got
01:46:07.760 speed and then you've got uh you've got
01:46:09.960 you've got uh effort right so the idea
01:46:12.679 is how do we make it faster and easier
01:46:17.400 faster and easier faster and easier over
01:46:19.760 and over and over again on this value
01:46:21.400 equation and a lot of times what makes
01:46:23.560 things faster and easier is removing
01:46:24.920 things and so I have grown more and more
01:46:27.280 Affinity towards looking at what's there
01:46:29.159 and saying okay we need to maximize
01:46:31.199 value per second not seconds of value
01:46:34.520 and so this comes from the media side uh
01:46:36.599 in terms of making content but on the
01:46:38.400 product side like every customer will
01:46:40.440 ask you for different things and they
01:46:42.360 will and if you give them every single
01:46:44.199 thing they ask for they will cause their
01:46:46.599 own demise and then leave and so then
01:46:48.280 you get these Frankenstein products that
01:46:49.880 have a gazillion gizmos that no one
01:46:51.320 knows how to use because to fit it all
01:46:52.639 in it's like there's a 100 specific use
01:46:55.000 cases that don't apply to everyone and
01:46:56.320 so product discipline around keeping
01:46:59.520 Simplicity and speed and and ease as the
01:47:02.639 primary goal is an incredibly difficult
01:47:05.280 thing to focus on and making those
01:47:07.119 strategic bets and so that has been a
01:47:09.719 great Focus uh and kind of uh relearning
01:47:12.480 I would say uh of this year with school
01:47:15.239 and I would say finally having like
01:47:17.280 knowing what your what Your Loop is all
01:47:20.119 right so it's like what's your flywheel
01:47:22.000 so Jim Collins has a short book on this
01:47:23.840 called the flywheel I think or flywheel
01:47:25.560 effect and it's basically like can you
01:47:28.119 draw a circle within your business which
01:47:30.440 is first we do this which then if we do
01:47:33.239 this this is what must occur when this
01:47:35.080 happens this next thing must occur if
01:47:37.040 this occurs this next must occur right
01:47:39.280 and so I I'll show you what what what
01:47:41.360 I'm talking about so if we make a lot of
01:47:44.080 media right for businesses so we make a
01:47:47.639 lot of Business Media if we do that then
01:47:50.239 we will get business owners who Interest
01:47:52.639 Who who interested in our stuff right
01:47:54.599 and if we get business interested
01:47:56.040 business owners who are interested in
01:47:57.159 our stuff right they will then do deals
01:48:01.159 if we do deals with them we'll have
01:48:03.599 stuff to make media about and so this is
01:48:06.520 a basic wheel of acquisition. comom we
01:48:09.000 talk about business stuff that gets
01:48:10.679 businesses interested we do deals with
01:48:12.599 those businesses those businesses get
01:48:14.239 outcomes which then we talk about in the
01:48:15.760 media and so round and around we go we
01:48:17.599 want a wheel that feeds itself and so
01:48:19.960 the only thing that's required is to get
01:48:21.520 the wheel moving and So within school we
01:48:23.760 have multiple different Loops that we
01:48:25.639 have that generate the growth that
01:48:28.360 compounds within the business and these
01:48:29.639 Loops are so important because when you
01:48:31.400 have a linear input output equation in
01:48:33.400 terms of how business grows then it
01:48:35.000 means that you just have to keep adding
01:48:36.560 more on the front end what you want is
01:48:38.800 something that you spark once the engine
01:48:40.960 runs and then all of a sudden it spins
01:48:42.840 spins and goes out of control and it
01:48:44.520 just keeps growing right and so that is
01:48:47.000 the ultimate goal is having multiple of
01:48:48.719 these flywheels so a simple example is
01:48:51.040 like Amazon they create a Marketplace
01:48:52.440 that has the cheap cheapest products
01:48:53.800 that are the that have the highest
01:48:55.560 Fidelity in terms of um the risk that
01:48:57.920 someone has to make when they purchase
01:48:59.840 because they have the reviews so if they
01:49:01.360 do that then they will get more
01:49:02.480 customers if they have more customers
01:49:04.080 then they will be able to get more
01:49:05.599 suppliers if they have more suppliers
01:49:07.320 they able to get more competition in
01:49:09.000 selection for customers which then
01:49:10.239 brings in more customers right and so
01:49:11.760 round and around we go and so it's
01:49:14.320 businesses often have multiple flywheels
01:49:16.599 like this that exists that self-
01:49:17.840 reinforce and the quality of that
01:49:19.560 flywheel what you want to figure out is
01:49:20.760 what are the what are the friction
01:49:21.760 points that prevent this wheel from
01:49:22.960 spinning and then smooth it out so it
01:49:25.040 just runs so this is probably I would
01:49:27.599 say uh number five in terms of the
01:49:30.119 things that I I've gotten away from
01:49:31.239 school this year and school is probably
01:49:33.159 one of the best investments I've ever
01:49:34.480 made so this year and somewhat last year
01:49:37.719 we uh we got this great office right and
01:49:40.040 uh part of the reason we did this is
01:49:41.199 because I wanted to have a massive gym
01:49:42.639 I'm being really honest with you like I
01:49:43.760 wanted to have a really big gym which I
01:49:44.960 have and I wanted to have a place that I
01:49:46.040 could record that wasn't like out of my
01:49:47.520 house or out of a closet as much as it
01:49:49.080 is great to have my team in and out of
01:49:50.599 my personal space um I prefer it in a
01:49:53.119 studio and so uh that was the reason for
01:49:56.040 building this to begin with then we
01:49:57.719 started having a lot of teammates just
01:49:59.199 started like spending more time here and
01:50:00.679 they're like may maybe I'll move here
01:50:01.920 and so then we started to become more
01:50:03.560 and more in person as a business and so
01:50:05.440 I will remind anyone I started in person
01:50:07.840 exclusively with gyms then we went to
01:50:10.159 gym launch which was entirely a remote
01:50:11.719 business and we were entirely remote
01:50:13.239 before it was cool like we were entirely
01:50:15.000 remote when people were like you can't
01:50:16.920 be a remote business it's not legit for
01:50:18.960 real like we like we would struggle to
01:50:20.920 get like some banking relationship cuz
01:50:22.880 they're like we need to I remember there
01:50:24.280 was some software that we needed that
01:50:25.639 were like we need to see a picture of
01:50:27.040 your filing cabinet and I was like what
01:50:28.920 year is it but it's like it was
01:50:30.840 Antiquated until Co and then became the
01:50:32.480 norm and so I want to talk about pros
01:50:34.560 and cons to this because some of you
01:50:35.560 guys are business owners and you're
01:50:36.520 trying to make this decision and so
01:50:38.280 number one I think is understanding
01:50:40.119 which roles are remote and which roles
01:50:41.880 are in person so for us because we know
01:50:44.320 how to manage I think remote teaches you
01:50:45.920 how to manage better than in person does
01:50:47.639 because there's so many ancillary small
01:50:49.480 Communications that occur in person that
01:50:51.400 don't get documented remotely that still
01:50:53.440 have a material impact on the business
01:50:55.320 and so if you're only remote you have to
01:50:56.719 be very structured with communication if
01:50:58.040 you're in person you can get away with a
01:50:59.480 lot less now four roles like
01:51:02.360 fundamentally we say like why does this
01:51:03.880 person need to be here we would only
01:51:05.480 want people to be here who should be
01:51:07.199 here if you know if Finance doesn't
01:51:09.880 really need to be in the office and so
01:51:12.360 that allows us to recruit from a wider
01:51:14.360 net so we can recruit from all over the
01:51:15.719 United States rather than requiring
01:51:16.760 people to move uh or only picking from
01:51:19.040 call it Las Vegas right and so for us
01:51:21.560 the pros have been training is much
01:51:23.560 better in person culture is much
01:51:25.360 stronger uh I think you have an eye to
01:51:27.119 efficiency which to be fair is somewhat
01:51:28.800 offset with the additional cost of the
01:51:30.199 building I think that you're able to see
01:51:32.719 people in deep work and correct meeting
01:51:35.079 cadences things like that like if you're
01:51:36.239 walking around everyone's on meetings
01:51:37.320 all days you're like who's working right
01:51:39.480 uh and so this allows you to you get
01:51:41.000 faster feedback loops which I think is
01:51:42.480 important the cons of in person is that
01:51:45.119 harder attract talent because they have
01:51:46.400 to move that's a big one it's probably
01:51:47.920 the biggest one but it's easier to
01:51:49.880 attract other people though so for us
01:51:51.520 what we did to accommodate this is we
01:51:53.000 for some roles depending on the level of
01:51:54.719 the role we will also uh include signing
01:51:57.000 bonuses and things like that so if
01:51:58.320 you're in that position including more
01:52:00.639 incentive for them to move or move their
01:52:02.599 families to your place of business is a
01:52:04.400 is is a good way to do it I also
01:52:06.040 recommend having them come out for like
01:52:07.320 30 days and stay at a hotel just so that
01:52:09.360 they don't like you know deant their
01:52:11.800 whole family if for some reason it
01:52:13.960 doesn't work out kind of in the first
01:52:15.560 month you'll know and so um that's
01:52:18.040 that's like a little in between that I
01:52:19.719 think is worth doing that has worked
01:52:21.719 well for us to be to be clear for me I
01:52:23.119 think 30% of our portfolio is in person
01:52:25.239 70% of remote so I don't have I I don't
01:52:27.440 care at all about how someone chooses to
01:52:30.520 have you know structure their employee
01:52:32.000 teams I think you should just whatever
01:52:33.599 way it is I just want there to be sound
01:52:34.880 reasoning behind it and so for us
01:52:36.520 obviously we have a lot of media and so
01:52:37.880 having the entire media team here makes
01:52:39.440 sense because I film here I'm here and
01:52:41.679 so they should be here too whereas like
01:52:43.920 I said Finance it doesn't really make
01:52:45.159 sense and so it's just making sure that
01:52:46.639 like you're not being a stickler in
01:52:47.679 either direction for the sake of it and
01:52:50.199 instead just saying like what problem
01:52:51.320 are we solving and which path increases
01:52:53.960 the likelihood that it gets solved so
01:52:55.920 this year I actually made a lot of
01:52:57.920 personal improvements in terms of my
01:53:00.480 environment and I'll share some of those
01:53:02.719 with you right now and so as I was
01:53:04.679 saying earlier you know I worked a lot
01:53:06.159 more days this year a lot more hours per
01:53:07.560 day than I probably worked in recent
01:53:09.079 history and I needed to optimize more
01:53:11.960 things it's kind of like when a car is
01:53:13.079 driving at 60 miles an hour it's like it
01:53:14.520 moves a little bit when you're at 200
01:53:15.599 miles an hour tiny movement makes a huge
01:53:17.000 change was kind of the same thing in
01:53:18.360 terms of me and so with the increase in
01:53:20.440 hours the increase in days I was like I
01:53:22.000 need to get everything else dialed and
01:53:23.760 so one massive one which is going to
01:53:26.119 sound so silly is the big three of sleep
01:53:29.560 so number one is Pitch Black and when I
01:53:32.199 say pitch black I mean pitch black so
01:53:34.719 tape the little lights on all the
01:53:36.599 electronics in the room get blackout
01:53:38.639 curtains I'm telling you just do it I
01:53:41.000 took way too long to do it just do it
01:53:43.679 just do it please do it number one
01:53:45.880 number two is it's got to be cold like
01:53:47.880 it has to be super cold and if you are
01:53:49.920 in a different temperature than the
01:53:51.520 person you sleep with then get one of
01:53:53.480 those mattress pads that has the
01:53:54.880 temperature control thing it will change
01:53:56.440 your life and it will certainly change
01:53:57.560 your sleep which could very much change
01:53:59.040 your life just do it like it's it's I
01:54:00.719 think they're they're like two grand and
01:54:03.040 you spend more time in bed than anywhere
01:54:04.320 else like it's the Wellspring of Youth
01:54:06.800 it's everything like worth doing and the
01:54:08.960 third one and this is the most recent
01:54:10.599 one is that I actually added in earplugs
01:54:13.960 so I now sleep with earplugs which you
01:54:16.719 just the simple foam ones like nothing
01:54:18.599 crazy and sleeping with earplugs had a
01:54:22.400 four beats per minute drop to my resting
01:54:27.239 heart rate at the bottom of my sleep and
01:54:30.639 so I bring this up because like it had a
01:54:33.079 material difference in basically how
01:54:35.920 deeply I rest and my deep sleep is
01:54:40.079 basically very chunky and front loaded
01:54:42.960 rather than like intermittent throughout
01:54:44.480 the evening so it's like basically as
01:54:45.639 soon as I get to bed I have like deep
01:54:47.599 sleep because I hear no it's like I'm in
01:54:49.480 this black float tank essentially this
01:54:51.639 cold dark tank where I can't see
01:54:53.920 anything or hear anything and so you
01:54:56.480 you'll know when it's dark enough if
01:54:57.880 when you open your eyes and when you
01:54:59.199 close your eyes it's the same that's
01:55:01.400 where you want to be and so those are
01:55:03.159 some those are some significant ones the
01:55:05.119 next big one for me was making sure that
01:55:08.480 my work environment was basically just
01:55:10.679 as tailored and so I've usually been
01:55:12.400 better about this but I always black out
01:55:13.760 my windows because I get distracted with
01:55:15.480 good weather I just want to go outside
01:55:16.920 and so I black all that stuff out I had
01:55:19.320 two desks that I set up one for standing
01:55:21.599 one for sitting because I realized that
01:55:22.920 having a desk that moved I ended up just
01:55:24.800 not moving it cuz I didn't want to like
01:55:26.000 mess the wires up and like all the other
01:55:27.400 stuff so I just set up two desks and so
01:55:29.199 that was uh helpful the biggest pain
01:55:32.280 relief thing that I did this year
01:55:33.599 because I spent a lot of time on my desk
01:55:35.880 is I got a kneeling chair all right
01:55:39.119 which sounds ridiculous and they look
01:55:40.920 goofy but if you sit in one position all
01:55:43.599 day like I was getting really bad uh
01:55:45.679 neck pain uh like it was very tough for
01:55:48.119 me um and so by switching the kneeling
01:55:50.880 chair originally I thought I was going
01:55:51.920 to do my day in one chair half my day in
01:55:53.560 the other chair but then I realized that
01:55:55.079 when I was in the kneeling chair I
01:55:56.840 actually have like six different sitting
01:55:58.679 positions that I do in that chair and so
01:56:01.560 by constantly varying my sitting
01:56:03.639 position because as soon as I get a
01:56:04.520 little bit uncomfortable I just I just
01:56:05.599 change it up I was able to basically
01:56:07.599 decrease the resting stress on like my
01:56:09.960 muscles being in this one Frozen
01:56:11.800 position for an extended period and that
01:56:15.000 eliminated my shoulder pain like gone
01:56:18.719 and so I like really really helped me
01:56:21.320 out a lot and so I don't I don't know
01:56:22.920 what you're doing but like it was
01:56:24.520 probably like a 100 bucks and like such
01:56:26.719 high Roi for me and then the last piece
01:56:28.880 is actually around my fitness so because
01:56:30.639 I was in this very heavy season I
01:56:32.520 decrease my workouts to two a week which
01:56:34.599 is pretty light for me but I just made
01:56:36.599 those the absolutes so I basically did
01:56:38.639 Saturday Sunday as my two workout days
01:56:40.440 and I just go really hard on those days
01:56:43.400 and that's actually kind in a weird way
01:56:44.880 it's been more fun for me than trying to
01:56:46.560 do shorter more frequent workouts and so
01:56:48.719 it's actually kind of brought some like
01:56:50.280 more life back into my training even
01:56:52.119 though though I'm doing it less
01:56:52.840 frequently I'm like looking forward to
01:56:54.280 it and I realized that for me I love
01:56:57.560 training on one condition that I'm not
01:56:59.560 in a rush like I hate having to like do
01:57:04.360 a workout in 45 minutes because I have a
01:57:05.960 call like it takes all the fun out of it
01:57:08.280 for me and so I do it on Saturdays and
01:57:10.000 Sundays because I can just wake up I
01:57:12.679 will work out as long as I feel like and
01:57:14.840 then I'll start working and that's been
01:57:16.520 like really really good for me but part
01:57:18.840 of this has also been my transition U at
01:57:21.119 35 I told myself you know when I was 15
01:57:23.679 I get 35 I will I will transition to
01:57:26.400 longevity and so I have made that
01:57:28.400 transition now and so I'm like I'm
01:57:30.159 probably the lightest I've been in a
01:57:31.199 long time I'm like 203 is right now
01:57:34.440 which is very light for me for context
01:57:36.199 my heaviest I was 250 so I was very it's
01:57:38.840 all all steak um and so now I'm I'm 203
01:57:42.560 and um basically chihuahua live longer
01:57:44.880 than Great Danes uh which is small dogs
01:57:47.159 live longer and so I want to put it you
01:57:49.040 know less less uh stress on my heart and
01:57:51.159 so I'm so for those who are like Alex
01:57:52.840 looks smaller that's true cuz I am I
01:57:54.520 have lost weight I've lost about 10 or
01:57:56.440 15 pounds and so I'll probably stay
01:57:58.239 around here maybe I'll get in the high
01:57:59.719 190s but I'll probably I I maintain here
01:58:02.159 pretty easily and so that's my update on
01:58:04.920 that that part and I do think that it's
01:58:07.360 okay to have seasons like I'm not saying
01:58:08.719 I'm only going to work out twice a week
01:58:09.639 forever I'm saying I'm work out twice a
01:58:10.800 week now like I I worked out three times
01:58:12.280 this week and so it's not like I have
01:58:13.440 these rules it's just that I absolutely
01:58:15.000 committed to Saturdays and Sundays and
01:58:16.239 being a weekend warrior and that has
01:58:17.760 worked well for me to not work basically
01:58:19.520 give myself permission to do that so
01:58:21.079 that I could keep working hard on the
01:58:22.440 stuff that needed to get moved forward
01:58:23.800 so next one is culture so I Define
01:58:26.840 culture as the rules that govern
01:58:27.960 reinforcement in a business and so that
01:58:29.679 means like the rules of behavior what is
01:58:31.400 what is what is good what is neutral
01:58:32.800 what is bad and typically people have
01:58:35.119 some sort of values that they create
01:58:37.199 that are supposed to embody that culture
01:58:39.400 those values typically are you know
01:58:41.440 either phrases or they're one or two
01:58:43.040 words and you have you know three to 10
01:58:45.920 of them right and so for us I've always
01:58:49.239 believed in three because I don't think
01:58:50.159 anyone beli like remembers more than
01:58:51.440 three and if they can't remember them
01:58:52.480 there's no point in having them but
01:58:54.000 those three typically are very bucketed
01:58:57.000 terms that then need to have hundreds of
01:58:59.040 behaviors underneath them that kind of
01:59:00.599 roll into that culture it's not like you
01:59:02.560 only have three rules of Behaving you
01:59:04.520 have three concepts that have many
01:59:06.840 applications across different conditions
01:59:09.320 and so a big one that we've been
01:59:12.360 focusing on Lea and I together has been
01:59:14.119 kind not nice and so I think that in the
01:59:17.159 wake of wokeism if you will there's been
01:59:19.079 a lot of accommodation that has been
01:59:21.560 accepted tolerated within businesses
01:59:23.679 which is like everybody needs to have
01:59:25.239 these like you know safety zones and
01:59:27.400 everyone everyone everyone has to feel
01:59:28.960 hugged and fluffy and like all this
01:59:31.520 stuff and I believe that this is a
01:59:33.920 pendulum right and I think that the
01:59:35.760 pendulum swung here and I think a lot of
01:59:37.400 Brands Walmart just came out recently
01:59:38.960 rolling back some of its initiatives I
01:59:41.000 know uh Victoria Secret did last year
01:59:43.079 like a lot of them are starting to swing
01:59:44.679 back now I do think that we're going to
01:59:45.920 swing too far the other way to be clear
01:59:47.360 because that's how we do that's how us
01:59:48.679 humans do things right but I think it's
01:59:50.400 going in the right direction right now
01:59:51.719 which is going back towards the middle
01:59:53.400 and so uh within acquisition. comom we
01:59:56.040 have this big belief that we're very
01:59:57.760 good at training like we're very good at
01:59:58.960 training skills because it's something
02:00:00.000 that Lea and I pride ourselves on and
02:00:01.400 we're in this inperson environment we're
02:00:02.639 good at fast feedback loops we're very
02:00:04.040 good at breaking skills down uh into
02:00:05.800 smaller chunks to make them manageable
02:00:07.199 for somebody who's new the problem is
02:00:09.199 that sometimes that goes into no man
02:00:11.199 left behind and we are not a government
02:00:13.159 program instead it should be if you
02:00:15.480 can't keep up you can't come and so I
02:00:17.760 think this is a departure from the
02:00:19.599 traditional like all accepting let's all
02:00:21.639 all arms open like if someone you know
02:00:24.079 has like you know they don't like
02:00:25.719 working late it's like well then this
02:00:26.920 isn't for them and they can find another
02:00:28.560 job that's that that will accommodate
02:00:30.239 that but I do not because we were trying
02:00:31.800 to accomplish great things and great
02:00:33.760 things require great sacrifice and it
02:00:35.520 doesn't feel like a sacrifice to the
02:00:37.280 person who also wants the great thing it
02:00:39.239 only feels like a sacrifice for someone
02:00:40.639 who doesn't and so that price diminishes
02:00:43.079 for someone who's aligned and so kind
02:00:44.840 not nice also brings into into light
02:00:47.199 like being able to have these sincerely
02:00:49.119 canderous conversations of saying like
02:00:50.760 you are not where you need to be and I'm
02:00:53.159 going to give you a really good nug on
02:00:54.560 this is that right now you can pause
02:00:56.719 this video and I need you to show it to
02:00:58.159 your team because what they don't
02:01:00.079 understand is the difference between an
02:01:01.239 insult and you might not understand it
02:01:02.520 either and this this like changed my
02:01:04.239 life insult and criticism so do you know
02:01:07.320 the difference well I'll explain it so
02:01:09.679 an insult is where basically you slander
02:01:12.239 the other person you assign a word that
02:01:14.520 has a negative connotation so I say
02:01:16.199 something like you are lazy you are uh a
02:01:19.320 piece of you're a dick you whatever
02:01:21.599 whatever insert insert the insult you
02:01:23.480 want a criticism is the gap between
02:01:28.880 desired and actual this is a commentary
02:01:32.480 which is factual which is the
02:01:34.840 expectation is that you show up every
02:01:36.199 day by 9:00 a.m. you've shown up every
02:01:38.320 day at
02:01:39.520 9:05 therefore there's discrepancy here
02:01:43.560 in order for you to continue maintaining
02:01:45.079 your employment you need to be here
02:01:46.679 before night so this is a criticism it's
02:01:49.560 simply observing reality and if you can
02:01:52.560 do this this will allow you to help
02:01:54.599 people without having the emotional
02:01:56.000 charge now if I say you're 5 minutes
02:01:58.280 late and you're that makes you lazy or
02:02:01.159 that makes you uncommitted or that makes
02:02:03.280 you insert whatever insult it then turns
02:02:05.960 this into an emotionally charged
02:02:07.239 conversation and so what happens is and
02:02:08.960 this is why I think it's important is
02:02:10.079 that you need to explain to your team
02:02:11.679 criticism is not negative it's an
02:02:13.880 observation of reality an insult is
02:02:16.159 where we attach judgment to that
02:02:18.199 discrepancy like your content sucks
02:02:21.960 that's tough and the the secondary of
02:02:24.199 that is you suck because your content
02:02:26.320 sucks which is even harsher but instead
02:02:28.280 it says our Channel average is 100,000
02:02:31.960 the content that you make is 75,000 in
02:02:35.239 order for you to keep your employment
02:02:37.159 here you need to be above 100,000 and
02:02:40.040 now let's break down what do we need to
02:02:43.040 do behaviorally that will increase the
02:02:45.880 likelihood that you meet desired or
02:02:48.280 exceed it and so then this is where you
02:02:50.000 get to teach this is where you get to
02:02:51.360 train if someone's always late to
02:02:52.800 meetings they might not be lazy they
02:02:54.800 just might not have the skill of showing
02:02:56.119 up on time which is a skill and so you
02:02:58.639 then say okay do you set alarms how do
02:03:01.400 you estimate your time of driving do you
02:03:03.440 do it on the fastest time you've ever
02:03:05.000 driven somewhere or the slowest time
02:03:06.679 you've ever driven somewhere right do
02:03:08.239 you do it on the fastest time you've
02:03:09.440 ever gotten dressed or the slowest time
02:03:11.000 you've ever gotten dressed and so
02:03:12.239 typically when people estimate time they
02:03:14.119 usually just skew to one of these two
02:03:15.440 things there's the people who are always
02:03:16.760 way too early it's because they do worst
02:03:18.159 case on everything and then you've got
02:03:19.639 the people who are they do best case on
02:03:21.159 everything and they're always late right
02:03:22.599 so it's like how do you estimate time
02:03:24.920 and how do you set reminders for
02:03:26.199 yourself to get places by the time you
02:03:28.400 need to and so literally breaking down
02:03:30.119 that skill which seems obvious and yet
02:03:32.280 there's many young people and to be fair
02:03:34.440 sometimes old people who don't know how
02:03:36.000 to show up on time and so understanding
02:03:39.280 this and saying if we don't share this
02:03:41.199 criticism we are being nice not kind we
02:03:44.559 are not we are seeking we are seeking
02:03:47.639 contentment we are seeking approval from
02:03:50.360 everyone we are seeking consent
02:03:52.360 we're not seeking truth and so we need
02:03:54.280 to be truth seeking as a business and so
02:03:56.800 we must always State the facts and tell
02:03:58.320 the truth and if someone is not up to
02:04:00.280 Snuff we need to communicate that as
02:04:03.040 fast as possible and give them the steps
02:04:05.320 in order to remedy the situation and so
02:04:07.520 this is the part I think both of these
02:04:08.840 things get missed bosses will say he's a
02:04:11.159 dick he's lazy he's whatever and
02:04:13.000 sometimes we'll say to the person
02:04:14.000 sometimes we say behind their back both
02:04:15.000 of those are bad instead I would
02:04:16.719 encourage you to go criticism and then
02:04:18.960 steps so the way to do this is you say
02:04:21.920 tell them what to do instead so don't
02:04:24.599 just say don't do this say do this
02:04:27.159 instead of this that way you give them
02:04:29.559 directions because no one can operate on
02:04:31.199 a negative give them what to do and this
02:04:34.119 has dramatically improved my skill as an
02:04:36.719 operator with within the business and
02:04:38.800 hopefully the kind not nice is something
02:04:40.639 that you can give to your team and that
02:04:42.159 you can say is like we are here to be
02:04:43.639 kind I want to help you win but I'm not
02:04:47.040 here to be your friend and I think Reed
02:04:48.639 Hastings has a really wonderful frame
02:04:50.040 around this which is like we are
02:04:51.000 professional sport team trying to win
02:04:52.760 the World Championships we are not a
02:04:54.719 family cuz you're not going to fire your
02:04:56.239 kids you're not going to fire your
02:04:57.360 spouse you're not going to fire your
02:04:58.480 mother but if you're on a professional
02:04:59.800 sports team it's like we are all here to
02:05:01.840 win and if you don't want to win this is
02:05:04.000 not the team for you there's Triple A
02:05:05.239 there's other teams there's other teams
02:05:06.520 that are Pros that don't want to win and
02:05:07.840 that's fine but that's not what we have
02:05:09.599 here and so the kindest thing that I can
02:05:12.040 do for someone is give them clear
02:05:14.400 feedback and opportunity to improve and
02:05:17.040 if they don't improve give them the
02:05:19.040 opportunity to work at a place where
02:05:20.679 they will better fit in now that it's
02:05:22.040 been 5 years and I'm back into operating
02:05:23.559 day-to-day on the media and conversion
02:05:25.320 team that we have at acquisition. comom
02:05:27.599 it's been fun to turn things around now
02:05:28.960 I already went through the optimization
02:05:30.199 framework and that's what I executed but
02:05:32.119 the output of that was number one I
02:05:34.480 removed all meetings number two I said
02:05:36.719 you can have ad hoc uh stand-ups between
02:05:38.840 each other when you want to solve a
02:05:39.800 specific problem so I don't want to I
02:05:41.000 don't want to stop communication I just
02:05:42.719 want to stop regular wasted time blocks
02:05:45.199 that don't increase your output the next
02:05:47.480 thing and to be fair when I did all my
02:05:48.840 one-on-ones uh with every single person
02:05:50.599 in the department to understand and what
02:05:52.079 they were struggling with one of the
02:05:53.400 biggest things that came back was we're
02:05:54.520 in meetings all day we hate being in
02:05:55.760 meetings I just want to work and I was
02:05:56.840 like great let me make it easier for you
02:05:57.960 to work the next thing was uh and this
02:06:00.079 was feedback that I got from some of the
02:06:02.159 managers when they saw me running this
02:06:04.239 was they saw a framework that I like a
02:06:07.360 lot which is what who when so think
02:06:11.639 about when you have a meeting and you're
02:06:12.639 like hey we got to do this thing right
02:06:14.119 that's the what all right then a lot of
02:06:16.520 times that's it that's the meeting
02:06:17.960 everyone just goes about their step way
02:06:19.559 this the next level of that is okay this
02:06:21.800 is what it is and this is who needs to
02:06:23.920 do it so who's going to own this who's
02:06:25.559 going to own this one right who's the
02:06:27.199 the chest to chest to poke the throat to
02:06:28.840 choke all right who's the one who's
02:06:30.239 responsible now if you have what and who
02:06:32.599 that's already a better stop but where
02:06:34.000 it gets really nasty is when you put in
02:06:35.960 when and so the question that I like to
02:06:37.800 ask here is how many hours will this
02:06:39.360 take I don't ask how many days I don't
02:06:40.760 ask what day you're going to get it done
02:06:42.079 by I say how many hours will this take
02:06:44.320 and then that person will say it'll
02:06:45.920 probably take because then you get to
02:06:47.040 hear it so it's like if someone says
02:06:49.119 like 20 hours I'm like 20 hours right
02:06:51.920 but if if you ask them what day they
02:06:53.159 might be like ah today's Tuesday I can
02:06:54.760 get to you by Friday I'm like why is it
02:06:56.000 going to take 3 days right so when you
02:06:57.559 ask hours it's like this will probably
02:06:59.360 take I don't know 90 minutes I'm like
02:07:01.360 Okay cool so you can get this done in
02:07:04.119 the next 90 now they will then say well
02:07:06.840 I have them other things to do I'm like
02:07:08.280 okay what are those things and then you
02:07:10.119 get to dive in and this is fundamentally
02:07:11.639 I think the job of the boss is to
02:07:12.719 prioritize this is strategy and they're
02:07:14.239 like oh well I have this other thing
02:07:15.639 that's for this massive project and I
02:07:17.480 have to get that done I'm like well how
02:07:18.639 long does that take and they'll say okay
02:07:19.920 this many hours and say okay do that
02:07:21.960 first and then this one you can start on
02:07:23.520 tomorrow morning you'll have it done by
02:07:24.520 lunch so hit me up at noon tomorrow when
02:07:26.119 you have it done now people get scared
02:07:28.639 about this because they're like why are
02:07:29.960 you driving all these deadlines the more
02:07:31.719 deadlines you have the more
02:07:33.280 opportunities you have to say nice job I
02:07:35.480 would rather tell someone you did a
02:07:37.040 great job seven times in a week than
02:07:38.960 once a week and so I also have found
02:07:41.239 that the best performers want to work
02:07:43.199 and they hate not working and they hate
02:07:44.920 things that get in the way work they
02:07:45.960 hate office politics they hate meetings
02:07:47.639 they hate gossip they just want to work
02:07:49.639 and so I want to create an environment
02:07:50.880 for those people people and if there are
02:07:52.800 a bunch of people who want to gossip and
02:07:54.480 want to have lots of meetings and want
02:07:55.679 to idate all day amazing just not here
02:07:58.960 with the who when framework this also
02:08:01.320 gets stacked and recapped all right so
02:08:04.800 think about how a meeting runs right so
02:08:06.480 okay first thing we got to do is this
02:08:08.040 okay what is it who's got it when are
02:08:09.639 you going to get done by how long is
02:08:10.960 that going to take can I pull it up can
02:08:12.280 I pull it up can I pull it up yep that's
02:08:13.800 fine all right great next one what's the
02:08:16.199 next thing great who's going to own it
02:08:17.800 how long's it going to take great you'll
02:08:18.800 do it by this time and then so what we
02:08:20.719 do is is I will recap every one of them
02:08:23.559 every time and so by the time I've done
02:08:25.320 my fourth one they've heard one four
02:08:27.559 times two three times the third one two
02:08:30.159 times and so there's this repetition
02:08:32.079 that's gets built in and then obviously
02:08:34.320 the thing at the very end is also be the
02:08:35.440 freshest so it's like I can repeat the
02:08:36.960 least the thing that's the most fresh
02:08:39.239 and the thing that I started with which
02:08:40.440 is like way out of their mind at this
02:08:41.559 point has been repeated like seven times
02:08:43.679 and so it makes it more likely that they
02:08:45.800 will actually do it now if you want to
02:08:47.280 go the 2011 version which I had to do
02:08:48.800 for a little bit was repeat it it back
02:08:51.719 to me so I would say okay got it that's
02:08:53.960 what you're going to do say it back to
02:08:55.239 me and I kid you not if you ask him to
02:08:58.480 say it back this is crazy like one out
02:09:00.840 of three times they'll just completely
02:09:01.920 get get it wrong it's because they
02:09:03.239 weren't listening they weren't paying
02:09:04.159 attention whatever and so I'm like oh my
02:09:05.760 God I can't believe that I was about to
02:09:07.079 leave this meeting and they still they
02:09:08.520 didn't understand what they needed to do
02:09:10.239 and so you can stack the who what win
02:09:12.119 you recap it all the way through and
02:09:13.760 then if you have a team that's not doing
02:09:15.119 as well ask them have them explain it
02:09:17.760 back to you so they know what needs to
02:09:19.520 happen now once you have this Loop in
02:09:21.440 place what do we do we lubricate it we
02:09:23.880 add money we add incentives so how can
02:09:26.840 we align what they do with the outcome
02:09:28.920 of the business and so back into Ops I
02:09:31.239 looked at everything eliminated all the
02:09:32.840 meetings and then I said okay in this
02:09:35.400 department everything is based on
02:09:36.599 quality and so we just need to make
02:09:39.520 better stuff and so I said if you make
02:09:43.199 better stuff I will pay you more I'd
02:09:45.559 rather have one guy who makes three
02:09:46.880 times the money than three mediocre guys
02:09:49.599 in a very real way it's easy easier for
02:09:51.639 me to manage one person there's way less
02:09:53.320 communication there's way less overhead
02:09:54.559 way less waste and we'll get better
02:09:57.800 outcomes and so if you're like okay I
02:09:59.639 understand how you did all this but how
02:10:00.679 did you communicate with them if they
02:10:02.440 had no meetings so I just switched to a
02:10:04.840 daily standup which is every day same
02:10:06.920 time uh we all hop on and I run
02:10:10.159 departments like sales teams all right
02:10:12.000 and I think that you can do this with
02:10:13.320 any business and the reason that I like
02:10:14.599 modeling sales teams for two reasons one
02:10:16.040 I have a lot of experience with them two
02:10:17.679 I believe that the way sales teams are
02:10:19.119 structured and operated have already
02:10:21.079 been optimize for performance because
02:10:22.679 the feedback loops are so tight if
02:10:24.520 you're not managing your sales team well
02:10:25.920 you find out very quickly and as soon as
02:10:27.880 you fix how you operate it you find out
02:10:29.280 very quickly and so I think that sales
02:10:30.679 teams overall are run typically very
02:10:33.199 well now what are the things about sales
02:10:35.599 teams so for new people when they come
02:10:37.280 in what do they do they listen to a lot
02:10:38.520 of gam tape this works for customer
02:10:39.880 service this works for media this works
02:10:42.000 for sales they watch a lot of the right
02:10:44.400 way to do things then what happens
02:10:47.079 there's a lot of role playing in sales
02:10:48.920 so it's if you could roleplay in
02:10:50.400 customer service you could role playay
02:10:52.639 around what would you look at with this
02:10:54.960 piece of content what would be the
02:10:56.800 moments that you would clip out how
02:10:58.719 would you structure it and you ask them
02:11:00.360 to explain the work that they would do
02:11:01.960 that's when someone new is coming in and
02:11:03.760 then we say okay we're going to give you
02:11:05.119 a half calendar if you're a sales guy
02:11:06.599 I'm going to give you a half calendar
02:11:07.639 for your customer service I'm going to
02:11:08.840 give you a half calendar for media to
02:11:10.159 make sure you're not posting tons of
02:11:11.280 crap you're just get one post a day and
02:11:13.320 then if you do a good job you meet kpis
02:11:15.760 then you get a full calendar then I can
02:11:17.719 give you an UNCA calendar right so we
02:11:19.679 have these progressions as long as they
02:11:21.040 mean maintain their quality metrics and
02:11:23.239 so like sales we have a similar
02:11:25.119 onboarding process the Huddle process
02:11:27.440 itself is let's look at the good stuff
02:11:30.079 and let's tear about apart the bad stuff
02:11:31.920 so we' review a call that went well
02:11:33.520 great and the far more valuable let's
02:11:35.639 look at a call that wasn't that didn't
02:11:37.280 go the way it should have and we let the
02:11:39.280 person who did the call correct
02:11:41.239 themselves so it's really tough if you
02:11:42.840 go jump in and like jump down everyone's
02:11:44.639 throat and tell them why they sucked
02:11:45.880 it's much easier for them to say these
02:11:47.639 are the things that I messed up and then
02:11:48.840 the team gets to say here's all the
02:11:50.480 things you did well that that way they
02:11:51.800 get some praise from everybody else but
02:11:53.599 they still get to have that feedback and
02:11:54.880 then you can prioritize okay this is the
02:11:56.400 thing that's the most important but that
02:11:57.760 still works for customer service it
02:11:59.639 works for product it works for media
02:12:01.960 which is okay why did this clip suck and
02:12:05.159 let's look at it and if you notice a
02:12:06.800 common theme for when Clips suck then
02:12:09.000 you just repeating it and reinforcing it
02:12:10.880 keeps it top of mind we have switched to
02:12:13.320 that process and it has been very good I
02:12:15.360 also got people off the bus who weren't
02:12:17.320 aligned with it and so if you have a
02:12:19.079 change that you want to do and you
02:12:20.360 foresee that people will not be aligned
02:12:22.000 with that change then I think that you
02:12:23.840 owe it to the high performers to to
02:12:27.480 create an environment that is only other
02:12:29.360 high performance you want to get it to
02:12:30.559 the point where it's so self-managed and
02:12:32.840 self- policed that if someone comes in
02:12:34.599 and isn't holding pulling their weight
02:12:36.239 they just get removed simple as that and
02:12:38.840 the whole team comes to you like dude I
02:12:40.040 don't think this is the guy right it
02:12:41.440 shouldn't come from you it should come
02:12:42.639 from the culture of the team and that's
02:12:44.360 why you can't have a culture of
02:12:45.840 acceptance where it's no man Left Behind
02:12:48.119 like oh they're not as good as we
02:12:49.199 thought but we're just going to keep
02:12:50.159 training them we're keep deploying these
02:12:52.000 resources is not to say that you can't
02:12:54.280 train someone the question is is it
02:12:56.320 worth it so the next big theme along
02:13:00.360 operations so I'll break this into
02:13:01.480 another chunk is technical versus
02:13:03.400 management all right and so this is very
02:13:05.559 common in tech companies right you have
02:13:07.960 a an engineer who's exceptionally
02:13:09.520 talented and you want to give them a way
02:13:12.639 to move up in the company but they don't
02:13:15.000 want to manage people and in most
02:13:16.800 companies the only way to move up is to
02:13:18.280 increase the headcount that's underneath
02:13:19.559 of you and so when I saw saw this within
02:13:21.800 our company I was like this feels dumb
02:13:24.239 we should find a way for the best sales
02:13:25.719 guys to keep making more and more money
02:13:27.079 we should find ways for the best media
02:13:28.440 guys to make more more money the best
02:13:29.599 customer service UPS making more and
02:13:30.679 more money especially in the roles that
02:13:32.159 have high leverage so basically the best
02:13:34.480 content creator has more leverage than
02:13:36.440 the best sales guy best sales guy is
02:13:38.159 closer to the reward though to be fair
02:13:40.079 and so the likelihood that what they do
02:13:42.280 generates revenue is much closer whereas
02:13:45.079 marketing or content could be
02:13:46.040 significantly further away so there's a
02:13:47.360 discount that's applied there right but
02:13:49.639 big picture is is is there a track for
02:13:52.360 both types of people because there are
02:13:54.079 the people who are experts at something
02:13:55.440 you just want to let them cook and so
02:13:57.559 when I realized that the the the orgs
02:14:00.079 that I basically the divisions that I
02:14:01.360 took over the only way that someone
02:14:03.000 would win was by moving up and when you
02:14:05.639 have a the only reward structure is
02:14:08.360 people underneath of you then what does
02:14:09.719 that incentivize it incentivizes you
02:14:11.960 keeping against to yourself because if
02:14:13.400 someone gets better than you then they
02:14:14.520 move ahead of you in the in the line
02:14:16.480 number one number two is it incentivizes
02:14:19.280 the managers and the whole team to
02:14:21.119 always ask to hire more people because
02:14:22.719 if you hire more people then it means
02:14:23.840 they by default move up in the
02:14:25.079 organization the third thing is that
02:14:27.280 whoever is in charge of the promotions
02:14:31.199 and the titles becomes Chief person
02:14:34.040 whose ass we must kiss and that means
02:14:37.400 that if you it basically becomes
02:14:38.840 entirely subjective as to who gets
02:14:41.760 promoted so then the next incentive that
02:14:43.599 comes up that's perverse is you want to
02:14:45.719 show how much you're working rather than
02:14:49.159 do work which are different
02:14:51.800 and so this is where people are like if
02:14:53.199 I said what did you do yesterday and I
02:14:54.800 was like you need to give me a th000
02:14:56.000 bullets you could probably come up with
02:14:57.440 a th000 bullets you're like I tied my
02:14:58.719 shoes and then I stood up straight and
02:15:01.000 then I put one pan my right pan leg on
02:15:02.960 and I put my left pan leg on and so
02:15:04.520 people make it seem like they're just
02:15:05.800 doing all of this work but they don't
02:15:08.400 tie that work to the output of the
02:15:10.679 division and when that happens is when
02:15:12.440 you have misaligned incentives so every
02:15:14.639 one of these incentive is perverse in
02:15:16.520 that it doesn't fuel the business but it
02:15:18.040 does fuel costs with this and with the
02:15:20.480 alignance incentives the team post
02:15:22.719 change has more than doubled output more
02:15:26.760 than and so I think the lesson here and
02:15:28.880 I think that we'll probably get to
02:15:30.040 Triple or quadruple like for real maybe
02:15:31.840 I'll do an update later but this has
02:15:33.400 been a recent takeover for me the thing
02:15:35.239 is is that people typically have
02:15:37.119 significantly more output potential if
02:15:39.840 you can tap into what we call
02:15:42.040 discretionary effort which is what is
02:15:44.079 that effort above and beyond the minimum
02:15:45.920 required to keep their job so everything
02:15:48.040 above you not getting fired is
02:15:50.360 discretional discretionary effort and in
02:15:52.840 most companies there's a massive amount
02:15:55.400 of effort above not getting fired that
02:15:57.960 is unlockable if the incentives are
02:15:59.960 aligned and so many people can in a very
02:16:03.119 real way triple how much they're doing
02:16:05.400 quadruple how much they're doing only if
02:16:07.639 they're incentivized to and so when you
02:16:09.880 have a political hierarchy it just means
02:16:12.480 elbowing no one teaching each other
02:16:14.599 anything saying we always need to hire
02:16:16.440 more people decreasing your output to
02:16:18.159 lowest potential possible as long as you
02:16:19.880 don't get fired and this when coupled
02:16:22.000 with a management style of never firing
02:16:24.679 is a great way to create waste so in
02:16:27.639 order to facilitate this there typically
02:16:30.119 has to be a change in compensation so
02:16:31.760 I've talked about incentives a couple
02:16:32.920 time through here and so my goal is to
02:16:35.879 try and have everything be pay for
02:16:37.638 performance to the highest degree
02:16:38.959 possible now here's where your
02:16:41.080 operations and your Finance team will
02:16:42.398 push back they'll say This is
02:16:44.280 complicated why can't we just do it the
02:16:46.439 way everybody else does it because just
02:16:48.760 because it's hard doesn't mean it's
02:16:50.000 worth it so there's a price but there's
02:16:52.040 also a return and so all they are
02:16:54.318 talking about is the price of this thing
02:16:56.240 not what we're going to get from it if I
02:16:58.318 could then go back to that Finance
02:16:59.679 person and say hey and to be fair this
02:17:01.439 isn't me saying anything about my
02:17:02.439 finance I'm saying you might have to
02:17:03.439 deal with this hey if we were able to
02:17:05.478 quadruple our output by creating a more
02:17:08.558 complex incentive structure that might
02:17:10.638 require someone full-time just to manage
02:17:13.519 is the cost of that one person full-time
02:17:15.558 managing it worth the increased output
02:17:18.120 of 4X across the entire company duh of
02:17:20.439 course it is
02:17:21.398 but it's more complicated and it's also
02:17:24.398 worth it and so I I bring this up
02:17:26.799 because you will probably get push back
02:17:28.318 if you try and incentivize people on
02:17:30.200 performance it takes more math it takes
02:17:32.558 more tracking but I will I will say one
02:17:34.799 key part which is that if people are
02:17:36.920 going to be paid on performance my
02:17:38.200 recommendation is two things one if you
02:17:40.120 make the transition allow them to keep
02:17:42.599 their existing salaries and then add the
02:17:44.879 performance on top and then for new
02:17:46.879 people bring them in and then just have
02:17:48.718 their performance but this allows
02:17:50.920 complete adoption of the new way rapid
02:17:53.080 reinforcement Loop that that they're
02:17:54.318 like this is way better and then
02:17:55.638 ultimately if you make the jumps in comp
02:17:58.120 proportional to the output that you seek
02:17:59.879 to get then you will still make more
02:18:02.599 than the cost so it's like going it's
02:18:04.318 going to the store buying 3x output at
02:18:06.879 twice the price of your 1X it's still a
02:18:09.000 better deal even though it costs more
02:18:11.040 around this pay for performance it will
02:18:12.760 also very clearly demonstrate who is
02:18:15.519 really good and who isn't and I haven't
02:18:17.799 really talked about like letting people
02:18:19.599 go who are low performers I'll just only
02:18:21.318 say this one word about it which is
02:18:23.398 bloat is like cancer in a business or
02:18:27.280 it's like weeds in a garden is that
02:18:29.240 bloat naturally occurs people hire more
02:18:32.160 people because the simplest solution is
02:18:34.799 throw money in bodies at stuff and it's
02:18:37.080 often not the right one you have to keep
02:18:40.240 your garden healthy by pruning it by
02:18:42.799 deweeding it you keep a tree healthy by
02:18:44.879 cutting off the Stray branches that are
02:18:47.120 growing in the wrong direction because
02:18:48.439 it's detracting from the growth of the
02:18:50.359 overall trunk and so this is the part
02:18:53.398 that that is that is probably contrarian
02:18:55.478 for most of you fire when things are
02:18:57.760 good not when they are bad so when
02:18:59.599 things are good is when you have the
02:19:00.920 most bloat and so it is far better to
02:19:04.359 let people go at that point for low
02:19:06.439 performance because it doesn't feel like
02:19:07.840 the company's losing feels like we're
02:19:09.599 being disciplined if you let people go
02:19:11.799 only when the company performance drops
02:19:13.398 it feels way worse having done both I
02:19:16.599 strongly recommend the other so for
02:19:18.558 example we were very fortunate but
02:19:20.318 during covid prior to co we had been
02:19:23.080 very militant about making sure that we
02:19:25.120 were making sure that everyone was
02:19:26.398 efficient and that the that the
02:19:27.799 headcount made sense based on the demand
02:19:30.000 and so when Co hit we had very minimal
02:19:33.318 amounts that we had to change internally
02:19:35.120 in the business and so because of that
02:19:38.280 um I think it was able to maintain
02:19:40.120 morale relatively well during a time
02:19:42.879 when my industry was getting destroyed
02:19:45.760 and there's a number of ways you can do
02:19:47.120 pay for performance and you don't need
02:19:48.680 to have as much performance as you might
02:19:50.840 think in order to incentivize action and
02:19:52.840 so if you're like I don't have budget
02:19:54.000 for that that's okay just just make a
02:19:56.080 couple tiers or performance and then you
02:19:57.560 can have flat bonuses by hitting some
02:19:59.640 tiers like you can I mean literally it
02:20:01.960 doesn't have you don't have to think in
02:20:02.960 percentages it can just be flat amounts
02:20:04.439 based on based on tiers and I think it's
02:20:05.920 a very good structure and a good way to
02:20:07.760 test this out is once you figure out
02:20:09.359 your your compensation thing that you
02:20:10.760 want to do back test it so just look at
02:20:12.960 what it would have been the month before
02:20:14.760 and then see what it is and if that
02:20:16.120 makes sense then it's like cool well I'm
02:20:17.680 going to assume the performance is going
02:20:18.800 to go up if I pay for that added
02:20:20.240 performance and am I okay with this
02:20:22.240 increase and if so which if you align it
02:20:24.319 with the incentives of the business it
02:20:25.600 should more than pay for itself the
02:20:26.840 structures that I'm talking about with
02:20:28.120 the sales team management functions best
02:20:30.120 in my opinion when you have teams of
02:20:32.200 similar function what that means is like
02:20:34.040 an executive team is going to be very is
02:20:36.160 has many people with very different
02:20:37.479 functions and expertise a customer
02:20:39.520 service team has many people with the
02:20:41.120 same function and expertise and so this
02:20:44.160 style of management of you know reviews
02:20:48.319 uh onboarding huddles what did we what
02:20:50.920 could we do better here those are great
02:20:52.920 when everyone does the same thing if
02:20:54.680 everyone does different things you will
02:20:56.760 have a different structure of it's far
02:20:59.920 more round table where everyone's more
02:21:02.160 or less updating and then coming with
02:21:03.960 the discussion topics that affect
02:21:05.520 everybody else and problem solving
02:21:07.800 together more than upskilling together
02:21:11.399 so that's really probably the main
02:21:12.880 difference between those is one is like
02:21:14.280 we're really solving problems together
02:21:15.920 for the majority of time not that you
02:21:17.240 don't do it the other way but the
02:21:18.479 majority of time we're solving big
02:21:19.680 problems with disparate teams or
02:21:21.520 different teams diverse teams and then
02:21:23.240 with similar teams homogeneous teams is
02:21:25.319 typically upskilling together and
02:21:26.880 aligning priorities so oh man this is a
02:21:29.600 big one problems and solutions have
02:21:32.479 delays all right so hear me out on this
02:21:34.840 right now you are living with problems
02:21:37.960 that you created 6 months ago and when
02:21:40.160 you begin to implement Your solution the
02:21:43.040 problem will not immediately go away and
02:21:45.479 so there will be this period of time
02:21:47.160 where you're executing a solution on a
02:21:49.479 problem that you cost 6 months ago and
02:21:51.399 you will still continue to live with the
02:21:53.000 problem because the solution has not
02:21:55.000 borne fruit yet it hasn't latched in yet
02:21:57.439 it hasn't come to fruition and so you
02:21:59.840 have to give Solutions the amount of
02:22:02.399 time they deserve to work before
02:22:04.760 appraising whether or not they worked to
02:22:06.920 begin with which I recommend doing prior
02:22:09.880 to implementing the solution so
02:22:11.399 basically when you're about to do
02:22:12.560 something to fix some problem say how
02:22:14.680 long do I think this should take before
02:22:16.479 I can say if it worked or not and then
02:22:18.280 stick to that because in the moment you
02:22:19.880 will only incur even more cost which is
02:22:22.200 why it's so painful it's like you have
02:22:24.080 this problem and now you're incurring
02:22:26.160 more cost to try and solving it and and
02:22:28.560 you're still suffering the problem and
02:22:30.040 the cost of solving it without the
02:22:31.399 benefit and so this is kind of the
02:22:32.880 endurance part of Entrepreneurship is
02:22:34.439 that you have to keep working without
02:22:36.120 seeing the result of your work you don't
02:22:38.200 need to change anything you need to
02:22:40.200 learn to endure because just because
02:22:42.439 it's not working doesn't mean you're not
02:22:43.840 on the right path and so the easiest way
02:22:45.680 to think about this is like if you were
02:22:46.880 to go to the gym and you start working
02:22:49.080 out and you start eating better you're
02:22:51.960 50 lbs overweight that problem was
02:22:54.760 created years in the past you now
02:22:57.319 incurring the solution is incurring the
02:23:00.000 problem you're still overweight and the
02:23:02.280 cost of the solution which is now you go
02:23:03.840 to the gym now you're not eating the
02:23:04.960 foods you like whatever but you're still
02:23:06.960 overweight and so after 7 days you might
02:23:09.720 think okay well I should stop doing this
02:23:12.080 because it's obviously not working you
02:23:13.760 have to give time time for the solution
02:23:16.680 proportional to the size problem it's
02:23:18.520 solving and if you don't approach it
02:23:20.680 this way and you ignore your problems
02:23:23.520 when you scale you scale your problems
02:23:26.600 with you which means that this is why
02:23:29.000 I'm such a believer in solving the
02:23:30.560 problems in order to scale rather than
02:23:33.120 scaling despite my problems because then
02:23:35.640 it just makes my problems bigger hairier
02:23:37.479 and nastier and so if you're living in
02:23:39.840 good times right now you can't rest on
02:23:42.080 The Laurels because it's not from the
02:23:43.800 work you're doing today it's from the
02:23:45.319 work that you did 6 or 12 months ago and
02:23:47.520 this has been a constant reminder for
02:23:49.160 Laya and I when we go through things
02:23:50.600 when things are good we're like what did
02:23:51.920 we do 6 months ago that is causing this
02:23:54.520 and if things are bad we ask what did we
02:23:56.800 stop doing or what did we add in in the
02:23:59.840 past that created this too often we look
02:24:03.160 at today and think that our bad days is
02:24:05.479 because of what we did yesterday and it
02:24:07.840 often isn't and so properly attributing
02:24:11.040 where the cause of the solution or
02:24:13.120 problem came from can give you the
02:24:15.040 outside return that you're probably
02:24:16.399 looking for and I'll give you this very
02:24:17.840 tactical tip if you see a a decline and
02:24:20.680 performance in a division or a function
02:24:23.000 of the business you'll it'll typically
02:24:24.720 look like this so let's say let's say
02:24:26.399 that you know you've got this div let's
02:24:27.640 say it's lead flow whatever and then it
02:24:28.840 starts flatten out and then it starts
02:24:30.720 going down right so you notice right so
02:24:34.479 what happens is people wake up here and
02:24:36.920 say we don't have enough leads right and
02:24:39.960 so they say okay well show me the ads
02:24:42.479 this week show me the ads last week so
02:24:44.760 the question is what ha like where do
02:24:46.800 you go do you go
02:24:48.160 here or do you go here
02:24:52.240 go here why did we stop growing not why
02:24:54.800 did we start shrinking and so you have
02:24:56.160 to look at where the Delta first
02:24:57.720 occurred and then what happened in this
02:25:00.080 what happened leading up to here what
02:25:01.399 did we change often times it's a who and
02:25:04.560 here's a fun one a lot of people think
02:25:06.000 oh we must have lost someone key most of
02:25:07.960 the times you added someone you added
02:25:09.399 someone
02:25:10.399 terrible I'm dead serious we had uh we
02:25:13.640 had an issue where our uh our Ascension
02:25:16.279 rates all of a sudden sudden like I know
02:25:17.760 I was like why are Ascension you know we
02:25:18.960 started looking at all these different
02:25:19.920 we looked at did all the functions we
02:25:21.040 looked at messaging all this stuff and
02:25:23.479 finally I was like and Lila brought it
02:25:25.760 up she's like let's just look at the
02:25:27.000 month when they stopped going up we
02:25:29.080 looked at that month and we looked at
02:25:31.319 what had happened the only change that
02:25:33.319 had happened was that we had hired a new
02:25:34.800 head we added
02:25:36.439 someone to do the job and by adding this
02:25:40.200 bad person they destroyed the function
02:25:42.880 and like sometimes it's a house sometime
02:25:45.520 sometimes you change your process and
02:25:46.800 sometimes that's the culprit but a lot
02:25:48.439 of times you added someone who actively
02:25:50.680 is destroying your business so another
02:25:52.399 big lesson of this year was around
02:25:55.160 content and so I made this video called
02:25:57.560 back to business I don't think it was
02:25:58.920 called that was basically we did this
02:26:00.560 experiment for 16 weeks where we made
02:26:03.439 very very wide content so like you know
02:26:06.279 meals and workouts and Vlogs and things
02:26:09.040 like that where we wanted to see okay
02:26:10.600 well if we get more views then maybe a
02:26:12.880 percentage of those people will be
02:26:14.040 business owners and so we our relative
02:26:16.600 amount will go down that are business
02:26:18.080 owners but our absolute amount will go
02:26:19.640 up and so that's all I care about is the
02:26:20.880 absolute amount and so it turns out that
02:26:23.359 that hypothesis was wrong at least for
02:26:25.399 us and so when we made wider content we
02:26:27.880 had fewer absolute amount of business
02:26:31.080 owners who were opting in who were who
02:26:33.080 were buying the books and so for me Book
02:26:34.399 Sales is actually a very leading
02:26:35.399 indicator for the people who we want
02:26:37.319 coming towards acquisition. comom and so
02:26:40.240 uh and email options on the site that's
02:26:41.720 a big one by the way if you're not
02:26:42.840 subscribed to mosy uh mosy money minute
02:26:45.080 it's one of the best things that I put
02:26:46.279 out there it takes a minute and I
02:26:49.240 deliver two every week that are
02:26:51.560 extremely tactical things that you can
02:26:53.319 immediately use to make more money like
02:26:55.319 very tactical what of the best things I
02:26:56.800 put out there so I think you go to
02:26:58.520 acis.com
02:27:00.600 newsletter and it's there so you can opt
02:27:03.399 in grab that I I think you will like it
02:27:05.600 it's very good I put a lot of time into
02:27:07.200 it okay back to business so in finding
02:27:11.160 that out we shifted our content indeed
02:27:13.880 back to business and lo and behold we
02:27:15.840 got more business owners crazy but I
02:27:18.640 think this is important because a lot of
02:27:20.319 us fall into this wide views vanity trap
02:27:23.439 and so being clear about why you're why
02:27:26.240 you're making content to begin with is
02:27:28.399 important if you're a business owner and
02:27:29.760 you're making content because you want
02:27:31.000 to make more money then you need to stay
02:27:33.880 on point serve the Avatar you serve and
02:27:37.160 that has served us very well especially
02:27:40.319 in the longest forms content I think the
02:27:42.479 shorter stuff you can get away with what
02:27:43.960 I would consider adjacent if you're a
02:27:45.920 salon lady and you sell haircuts I know
02:27:48.960 I'm butchering this but you get the idea
02:27:50.640 then if you talk about beauty in general
02:27:52.560 you will probably attract the type of
02:27:54.359 Avatar who spends money on these types
02:27:56.520 of things and so I see that as okay but
02:27:58.520 if you're going to do a long video
02:28:00.200 probably don't do it on makeup tutorials
02:28:01.880 if you sell haircuts get the drift so
02:28:04.120 another big part of this is that the
02:28:05.840 structure of the content for
02:28:07.920 entertainment is not the same as uh as
02:28:12.760 education and so with
02:28:15.200 education a lot of the effort is in the
02:28:18.600 pre-production with ENT entainment a lot
02:28:21.279 of the effort goes into post- production
02:28:23.000 there's obviously pre as well but the
02:28:25.000 post production there's just God like
02:28:26.319 think about making the Transformers
02:28:27.359 movie how much post-production is there
02:28:29.040 in that movie a ton right whereas some
02:28:31.479 of the top education videos on the
02:28:34.160 internet are just a dude with a
02:28:35.640 whiteboard which just goes down to the
02:28:37.600 quality and the Simplicity of the
02:28:39.439 content itself and so you can make
02:28:41.600 something significantly more compelling
02:28:43.680 by making the language more readily
02:28:46.760 accessible to your avatar now two compon
02:28:50.279 to this one is the examples that you use
02:28:53.040 you want it to be as relevant to the
02:28:54.359 Avatar as possible if I'm talking to uh
02:28:56.720 you know a bunch of mechanics then I'll
02:28:58.439 probably make a car analogy if I want to
02:29:00.880 talk to a bunch of ladies I might use a
02:29:03.160 cooking analogy right and that's with
02:29:05.080 traditional gender roles and stereotypes
02:29:06.640 deal with it all right and so the idea
02:29:08.680 here is I will try and speak in a way
02:29:11.000 that I think has the highest likelihood
02:29:13.160 of being language that will be
02:29:16.120 comprehended by the widest slice of my
02:29:18.000 target audience now if you have an even
02:29:20.680 broader audience then you would limit
02:29:23.040 the amount of analogies to things that
02:29:24.640 everyone understands so probably be
02:29:26.319 human things so I might be talking about
02:29:27.880 just eating in general sleeping in
02:29:30.359 general brushing your teeth in general
02:29:32.520 would be the analogies that I would use
02:29:34.200 and the grade language of my speech
02:29:36.800 would be as low as humanly possible so I
02:29:39.040 looked at this politics thing this was
02:29:40.600 before this election but they had shown
02:29:42.840 that the politician that spoke at the
02:29:44.720 lowest grade level won every election
02:29:47.120 now I don't know if that's held true
02:29:48.359 since then but I thought it was
02:29:50.279 relatively telling with all of these
02:29:51.880 different marketing strategies the one
02:29:53.680 that mattered most was actually being
02:29:55.279 understood which leads into one of the
02:29:57.760 biggest next things that we did which
02:30:00.000 was I'll put pre versus post here uh
02:30:03.359 which for us because we're education we
02:30:05.760 are focusing more on pre-production this
02:30:08.200 video right now we prepared for hours
02:30:10.760 like what are all the lessons I have
02:30:12.120 what are the examples I want to talk
02:30:13.439 about like this isn't me just turning on
02:30:15.080 the camera and saying like what's up I
02:30:16.479 actually put a lot into this and because
02:30:18.479 I it was a whole year it was also
02:30:19.479 helpful for me CU I like to crystallize
02:30:20.760 my own knowledge but prsus post and then
02:30:23.319 another one is is clear packaging right
02:30:25.439 is just be very clear about what it is
02:30:28.319 your content is about and what they're
02:30:29.880 going to get from it and so from that we
02:30:32.200 came up with the three PS which is
02:30:35.080 proof
02:30:37.920 promise plan and so every introduction
02:30:41.160 of every video has to have these three
02:30:43.000 things now it doesn't have to but we
02:30:44.439 found that when we included those things
02:30:45.640 those videos did better and so you
02:30:47.080 notice every video since this back to
02:30:48.880 business theme we have proof promise
02:30:50.560 plant within the first call it 30
02:30:52.800 seconds and so it's what are you going
02:30:54.800 to get from the video why should you
02:30:56.359 believe me and this is how we're going
02:30:57.399 to do it and so in this video I started
02:30:59.200 with we have these three companies uh
02:31:00.680 you know three of our companies are over
02:31:01.720 100 million we sked a lot this year we
02:31:03.160 went from you know 50 million in eida to
02:31:04.680 just under 100 you will learn the
02:31:06.399 lessons from this so you can apply to
02:31:07.560 your business and the plan that we're
02:31:08.880 going to do it is I'm going to walk
02:31:09.760 through them step by step all right
02:31:11.120 there we go right very straightforward
02:31:13.120 and the last piece which was a small one
02:31:15.520 which I actually got pushed back from my
02:31:16.880 team on which is why I'm sharing it with
02:31:18.359 you is introduce yourself
02:31:20.560 right so a lot of people are like oh we
02:31:21.720 don't want to introduce like my audience
02:31:23.000 knows who we are well good thing you're
02:31:24.439 not just making it for them you're
02:31:26.120 making it for people who don't know who
02:31:27.240 you are yet right and so what we did is
02:31:29.439 that we've actually now Consolidated
02:31:30.760 this to lower third and so at the
02:31:32.720 beginning of this video you should see
02:31:34.880 you know Alex rosi manage your partner
02:31:37.120 acquisition. comom so we actually able
02:31:38.520 to cut that out of me saying it because
02:31:40.080 we wanted to keep the intros really
02:31:41.240 tight but if no one knows who you are I
02:31:44.920 also have taken out the uh hey if you
02:31:46.800 don't know who I am just say I'm Alex
02:31:50.120 I'm the managing partner of ais.com this
02:31:51.880 is what we do or put it lower third and
02:31:54.479 then just skip forward right you you
02:31:56.160 want to keep it as tight as humanely
02:31:57.439 possible and when we look back at the
02:31:59.200 videos that did exceptionally well these
02:32:01.040 were the things that these were our
02:32:02.200 common themes we put more in Pre we
02:32:04.080 introduced ourselves we made it very
02:32:05.880 clear packaging we had a prooved promise
02:32:07.520 plan that was laid out we had examples
02:32:09.960 that were clear and relevant to our
02:32:11.960 Avatar which is business owners and so
02:32:13.920 we made content about business and lo
02:32:15.439 and behold it has been good and on a
02:32:17.479 personal note I prefer making business
02:32:19.200 content to not business content I like
02:32:20.680 resented I'll be really real with you I
02:32:22.359 I was so H I was afraid of the results
02:32:25.040 that were going to come in cuz I was
02:32:25.960 like if I'm going to have to make Meal
02:32:27.160 videos I'm going to kill myself I just
02:32:29.160 like I like like then we'll do our
02:32:30.840 workouts next I'm like no I'll just I'll
02:32:32.439 just be dead it won't matter like it
02:32:34.160 doesn't matter I'll just die and so and
02:32:36.319 so like I'm sure from like the thing is
02:32:38.600 is that I have a relatively High pain
02:32:39.680 Toler so like if it was the way to win I
02:32:41.800 would like if you were like hey if you
02:32:43.479 hit your hand with this Hammer your
02:32:44.680 business will keep growing like my hand
02:32:46.319 my hand would be a pancake right I would
02:32:48.120 just keep going at it but I I would
02:32:50.319 prefer not to do it that way and I'm
02:32:52.000 very grateful that you guys like
02:32:53.359 business concept better because that's
02:32:54.479 what I like making too so the next one
02:32:57.200 is around platforms and I think this was
02:32:59.279 really interesting so I looked really
02:33:00.680 deeply at the platforms from this last
02:33:02.960 year and so I made a whole tier list
02:33:05.560 video about this so I'm not going to go
02:33:07.600 in super depth on this but I would say
02:33:09.560 that the uh MVP of the year was email or
02:33:12.920 maybe most improved if you want to call
02:33:14.439 it that way I have not traditionally
02:33:17.160 spent a long time on email which seems
02:33:18.439 ridiculous cuz written word is my best
02:33:21.479 format duh and so I started writing
02:33:23.880 emails and they started doing well duh
02:33:26.160 like maybe I should hate money less I
02:33:27.600 don't know anyways so email was kind of
02:33:29.920 the MVP of the year for me probably the
02:33:31.439 the like the most improved like didn't
02:33:33.359 expect it the feedback I've gotten has
02:33:34.960 been exceptional and I made also a
02:33:36.640 separate video on how I just write my
02:33:38.000 emails and so you can watch that I'm
02:33:39.359 sure it'll be I'm sure you can find it
02:33:41.120 all right beyond that though Facebook
02:33:43.520 was a uh in terms of like book sales per
02:33:47.200 follower count and per view count was
02:33:49.279 kind of like the highest leverage like
02:33:51.040 we actually got a lot from that so we're
02:33:52.200 investing more in Facebook right now The
02:33:53.880 Perennial Champs were IG and YouTube uh
02:33:57.160 in terms of percentage of traffic that
02:33:59.040 came to acquisition. comom YouTube
02:34:00.640 Instagram were by far the biggest ones
02:34:02.840 the unbeknownst one was books this is
02:34:05.760 one that no one talks about but Amazon
02:34:08.399 is actually responsible for like 15% of
02:34:10.520 my traffic uh which is kind of cool
02:34:12.120 meaning basically the amount of people
02:34:13.520 who buy books and then read the books
02:34:15.000 and then go to the site a huge
02:34:16.200 percentage of my traffic indirectly
02:34:18.200 comes from Amazon because they because
02:34:20.120 my books do really well and have a lot
02:34:21.520 of reviews and and Amazon wants to have
02:34:24.160 people buy products that they like on
02:34:25.439 Amazon because then they associate the
02:34:26.720 good things from that product with
02:34:27.800 Amazon ha right it's like they have a
02:34:29.720 strategy and I also said in my tier list
02:34:31.680 video that Tik Tok was something that I
02:34:34.160 uh was deprioritizing and I thought more
02:34:36.120 about that since that video so it's been
02:34:37.439 like seven months I think since I made
02:34:38.840 that video I think that it's not that
02:34:40.600 Tik Tok is not a good platform for
02:34:42.640 business I think that we had a skill Gap
02:34:45.600 around Tik Tok and so I'm actively
02:34:47.399 trying to remedy that right now and
02:34:48.720 bringing in some amazing people I'm from
02:34:51.080 the Tik Tok side it's a platform I don't
02:34:52.399 know very well and so we are going to
02:34:54.359 just bring in great people and in line
02:34:56.080 their incentives and see what happens
02:34:57.520 but fundamentally I know there are
02:34:59.160 business owners on Tik Tok I just
02:35:00.520 haven't been able to package my content
02:35:02.439 in a way that did well on that platform
02:35:04.680 but if you're curious since we made the
02:35:06.359 incentive change our Tik Tok is up 300%
02:35:09.000 this week so you know incentives work
02:35:12.640 and speaking of those platforms I would
02:35:15.439 recommend checking out my email I did
02:35:18.000 say it earlier uh MIM moneyy minute I
02:35:19.920 put a lot of time into them I think
02:35:21.080 they're really good uh if you like my
02:35:22.760 books you love the emails it's like like
02:35:25.200 super super distilled down that really
02:35:28.279 proud of them it just it's just worked
02:35:29.359 out really well and so I think um I
02:35:30.920 think you will like them uh it's
02:35:32.600 acis.com newletter and by the way if you
02:35:34.760 haven't read the books for the love of
02:35:36.640 God it's the best stuff I have so like
02:35:38.600 if you like my videos you will like the
02:35:39.960 books more straight up you'll like them
02:35:42.240 more they're better and I feel like I
02:35:43.520 can say that objectively like I work on
02:35:45.120 both of them and I think that and it's
02:35:46.720 just fundamentally it's because I
02:35:47.720 haven't spent 2,000 hours on a video I
02:35:49.279 have SP $2,000 on a book so $100 million
02:35:51.760 offers $100 million reads check them out
02:35:53.600 if this was valuable for you it would
02:35:55.359 mean the world to me if you shared it
02:35:57.319 with another entrepreneur or people
02:35:59.040 inside of your team it's the only thing
02:36:00.760 that encourages me to keep doing this as
02:36:02.840 I shout into the dark abyss share it on
02:36:04.720 your stories text it to friends it it it
02:36:06.560 would mean a lot I don't have sponsors
02:36:08.000 for this thing and so that is my only
02:36:09.439 ask otherwise stay awesome
