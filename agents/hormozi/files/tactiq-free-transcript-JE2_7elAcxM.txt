# https://www.youtube.com/watch/JE2_7elAcxM

00:00:00.240 this is all my best presentations and
00:00:02.879 videos on sales you could call it my
00:00:05.200 Ultimate Guide enjoy selling with logic
00:00:08.119 to make lots of money and so this will
00:00:11.799 either be the best presentation on sales
00:00:14.400 you've ever heard the worst presentation
00:00:16.760 on sales you've ever heard or somewhere
00:00:18.720 in between that is a promise all
00:00:22.199 right and so I thought it would make
00:00:24.480 sense to start with this we have a high
00:00:26.400 this is Charlie Monger who's probably
00:00:27.560 like my number one hero in this season
00:00:29.359 of My Life
00:00:30.480 um we have a high moral responsibility
00:00:32.119 to be rational and I think that getting
00:00:34.440 someone to rationally decide is
00:00:36.079 important because emotional buyers often
00:00:37.680 times get excited they'll buy and then
00:00:39.960 who's had somebody who calls him two
00:00:41.200 days later it's like I don't know why
00:00:43.120 anybody raise your hand just so you know
00:00:45.039 you're not alone okay and what happens
00:00:47.399 is it's just like dating I think Lea
00:00:49.120 talked about it yesterday if you have a
00:00:51.160 rational foundation for a relationship
00:00:53.160 or a decision when the emotions fade the
00:00:55.840 logic will continue and so it's good to
00:00:58.280 to answer both sides of the
00:01:00.160 decision-making process the short-term
00:01:01.960 side is the emotion that gets you to
00:01:03.840 decrease your astion threshold and take
00:01:05.519 a step right but the logic is what makes
00:01:07.680 it stick and actually makes a great
00:01:09.000 customer all right and so for me and I
00:01:12.560 think that the further along you get in
00:01:13.880 business and the higher up you get in
00:01:15.479 business the more you'll see people who
00:01:17.000 tend to make more logical decisions more
00:01:19.000 logic first decisions and fewer and
00:01:20.720 fewer emotional decisions all right so
00:01:24.520 what does being a rational sorry what
00:01:26.280 does rational logical have to do with
00:01:28.000 selling well you have logical buyers and
00:01:31.000 you have emotional buyers in general
00:01:32.840 right most people sit on this Continuum
00:01:35.799 one way or the other and emotionally
00:01:39.880 people want to believe you people want
00:01:42.280 to buy you must help their logical
00:01:44.719 brains justify to decision that they
00:01:46.600 already want to make think about it that
00:01:49.520 way they want to buy from you you have
00:01:51.680 to help them all right so who here
00:01:55.880 identifies actually I'll skip through
00:01:57.439 this emotional logical you're probably
00:01:59.920 in between anybody in between these two
00:02:02.280 anyone all right then you'll love this
00:02:05.360 so before we get started I thought I
00:02:08.758 would give you a few beliefs about
00:02:10.119 selling that have served me very well
00:02:11.640 throughout the years number one people
00:02:14.319 want to believe you they want to buy you
00:02:16.239 must help their logical Brains Brains
00:02:18.120 justify the decision two selling happens
00:02:21.400 before you ask for the sale closing
00:02:24.680 happens after so you're selling for a
00:02:26.920 lot longer period of time but the moment
00:02:28.800 you kind of like take your pants
00:02:29.879 yourself and you're like this is what it
00:02:31.040 is that's when you're closing
00:02:33.840 right you have now
00:02:36.879 solicited now you
00:02:40.080 close three it's easier to handle
00:02:42.640 obstacles than objections I'll get to
00:02:45.360 what the difference between those are in
00:02:46.519 a
00:02:47.760 second that being said expect and plan
00:02:51.239 for no it is not failure it is expected
00:02:55.920 so stop being surprised it's one of the
00:02:57.680 first things we talk new sales guys into
00:03:00.000 is expect no that's not like that's a
00:03:02.959 part of this if they already were going
00:03:05.519 to say yes then you are not necessary no
00:03:08.560 is the job right if they could make the
00:03:11.480 decision on their own they would just
00:03:13.480 send you the money right the reason
00:03:15.239 they're struggling is because they can't
00:03:17.680 and they need your help which is why
00:03:19.440 sales is actually the first step in
00:03:21.879 coaching and I see sales as power if you
00:03:25.000 can have the ability to direct or
00:03:27.519 influence others that is power and I
00:03:30.319 feel like it should be made much cooler
00:03:33.200 than I feel like it is five if you
00:03:35.080 didn't get a gasp from a price tag you
00:03:36.920 didn't go high enough this is another
00:03:39.360 belief so for those of you who are
00:03:41.000 afraid to raise your price if you're not
00:03:43.400 getting gasps you're not going high
00:03:45.640 enough straight up and when you do it
00:03:48.519 that way you can always walk down and
00:03:50.080 have a beautiful price anchor right when
00:03:52.360 you say $100,000 first a grand feels
00:03:54.439 like a rounding error it's true but when
00:03:56.280 I say $10 first like I'm saying right
00:03:58.560 now $10 and I say a thousand sounds way
00:04:02.239 [ __ ] bigger doesn't it so you got to
00:04:04.400 get the gasp and you got to train your
00:04:06.000 guys if you have a team they have to be
00:04:08.439 comfortable with the no and they have to
00:04:10.159 be comfortable with the gasp they got to
00:04:12.040 go for the gasp be like dude you should
00:04:13.720 have heard the gasp on this one right
00:04:16.478 there we go seven selling properly is
00:04:19.238 the first step becoming a coach right
00:04:20.639 your first impressions the expectations
00:04:22.520 you set dictate the relationship how you
00:04:24.600 sell the fact that you use logic in the
00:04:26.800 sale will set you up for success and
00:04:28.680 your client for success in the long run
00:04:30.320 eight selling is helping prospects make
00:04:32.320 decisions to help themselves like you
00:04:34.120 are helping them help themselves that's
00:04:36.199 where the power comes from you are not
00:04:37.880 helping them you're helping them help
00:04:39.600 them see the difference it's nuan but
00:04:42.400 it's real nine keep the prospect not the
00:04:45.680 sale as the priority it's not about us
00:04:49.520 the more you can vanish in the sale and
00:04:54.000 and magnify them the better your selling
00:04:57.080 conversations will go because it's not
00:04:58.800 about us they don't care about you they
00:05:01.320 only care about them and they will talk
00:05:03.039 about themselves as long as they'll let
00:05:04.840 them this is a really important one
00:05:07.120 especially when you starts to getting
00:05:08.120 into closing seek to understand not to
00:05:12.440 argue and the way that I train our sales
00:05:14.880 teams around this is childlike
00:05:17.440 curiosity so when someone says when
00:05:19.759 someone objects to something it's like
00:05:21.880 ha that's so weird I wouldn't have
00:05:23.680 thought that tell me more about that
00:05:25.840 right and you get to be able to maintain
00:05:27.960 that childlike curiosity the same way
00:05:30.199 they train fighters to not breathe too
00:05:32.199 much during a fight through exposure the
00:05:35.639 more more times you get into these
00:05:38.240 uncomfortable high stakes closing
00:05:40.199 scenarios the less weird and high stakes
00:05:42.840 they become because they become what you
00:05:44.840 do every day and the good thing is you
00:05:47.360 get to have this conversation hundreds
00:05:49.440 and thousands of times and they only get
00:05:51.120 to have it once so you [ __ ] better be
00:05:52.960 better at it than them closing is a
00:05:55.039 dance not a fight it's seduction not
00:05:59.240 rape
00:06:01.400 I mean I'm being super serious about
00:06:03.520 this the goal is not to beat them into
00:06:06.319 submission the goal is to sell from your
00:06:09.080 back foot it's like I'm good I want to
00:06:12.240 help you help you and if that means not
00:06:14.479 doing this then I [ __ ] love it I'm
00:06:17.000 with you I'm on your team and I'll give
00:06:20.080 you a bullet around that in a second
00:06:21.919 selling is a transference of belief over
00:06:23.880 a bridge of trust therefore there are
00:06:26.479 two things that are required You Must
00:06:28.800 Believe so that you can transfer it and
00:06:31.400 you must have trust to make the transfer
00:06:33.960 because if you truly believe and a lot
00:06:35.360 of times you anyone been on a hot streak
00:06:38.160 when they're selling anyone anyone who
00:06:41.120 just had their hand up ever been on a
00:06:42.520 cold
00:06:44.880 streak most times you go from hot to
00:06:47.319 cold not because you forgot how to sell
00:06:49.319 because you stop believing in why you're
00:06:50.680 selling you have the same skills as you
00:06:52.599 did the day before but sometimes you get
00:06:55.039 a text you get an email get a pain in
00:06:57.199 the ass customer you ask for a refund
00:06:58.639 whatever the hell it is right and then
00:07:00.280 you question yourself and so that bridge
00:07:02.599 might have been created but there was
00:07:03.599 nothing to walk across it because your
00:07:05.240 cup wasn't full and so that's why
00:07:07.080 especially it's you in the beginning but
00:07:08.199 your teams over time the process of
00:07:11.319 filling conviction is one of the easiest
00:07:14.440 and best ways to increase someone's
00:07:15.560 closing percentage better than any of
00:07:17.440 the training in the world if you get
00:07:19.280 someone to believe they will sell the
00:07:21.280 right way because they're doing it not
00:07:23.560 to make the deal because they want to
00:07:25.039 help the other person 16 you can only
00:07:27.199 build trust if you genuinely want to
00:07:28.479 help and humans are exceptionally good
00:07:30.400 at sniffing out intention is a survival
00:07:32.560 mechanism you have to know if someone's
00:07:33.919 trying to double cross you we're very
00:07:35.840 good at smelling it out and the reason a
00:07:37.960 lot of you guys can't close is because
00:07:39.479 you only care about closing belief and
00:07:41.879 Trust are a Continuum not binaries so
00:07:44.400 it's not you believe or don't believe
00:07:45.759 it's not they trust you or don't trust
00:07:47.120 you but how much do they trust you how
00:07:49.599 much do you believe how deeply do you
00:07:52.400 believe because anyone ever been around
00:07:54.360 somebody who just believes balls to
00:07:55.800 Bones something that you think's batshit
00:07:57.560 crazy like I mean all the way so much so
00:08:01.560 that you start to question what you
00:08:03.800 believe that's what real conviction does
00:08:07.120 18 closers ask hard questions and it's
00:08:09.280 because you genuinely care that's why
00:08:11.560 you do it it's why we're here who here
00:08:13.919 wants to impact thousands of lives and
00:08:15.680 help people then you got to [ __ ] ask
00:08:17.960 hard questions because it's the only
00:08:20.000 thing that's going to actually Pierce
00:08:21.280 someone's hard and actually get the
00:08:22.440 transformation to happen if you can't
00:08:24.120 make if you cannot have transformational
00:08:25.759 conversations you cannot coach and this
00:08:28.280 is the first step
00:08:30.280 the person who cares the most about the
00:08:32.080 prospect wins the sale that includes
00:08:35.599 them so if you care more about their
00:08:38.000 well-being than they do you will win and
00:08:40.880 if you are more convicted they will
00:08:43.320 question their own excuses because you
00:08:44.959 are so
00:08:46.440 certain little TI Little Nugget for you
00:08:48.680 record all your sales by the way because
00:08:51.279 when you do get on that hot streak right
00:08:53.160 when you get on that hot streak and then
00:08:54.480 you get cold
00:08:55.839 again watch your hot streak see where
00:08:59.079 you pause what jokes you made when you
00:09:00.880 asked for the sale when you didn't how
00:09:02.519 you overcame it and it'll get you back
00:09:04.839 in the flow much faster than trying to
00:09:07.040 question yourself what do I do what do I
00:09:08.320 do always record all your sales it's
00:09:10.160 also the easiest way to train new people
00:09:12.640 and then lastly
00:09:14.160 21 power is the ability to direct or
00:09:17.040 influence people if you want to be
00:09:19.440 powerful you must understand this skill
00:09:23.240 and that's what we're going to talk
00:09:24.160 about cool awesome when does selling
00:09:27.720 happen does it happen when they're a
00:09:28.959 lead does it happen when we're
00:09:30.120 qualifying them does it happen when we
00:09:32.279 solicit the sale does it happen when we
00:09:34.959 close the sale when does the selling
00:09:37.720 happen all the time the entire time
00:09:40.320 selling is happening but what are we
00:09:42.600 going to talk about today just this just
00:09:46.360 closing everything you have to do after
00:09:49.560 asking someone to buy why are we doing
00:09:52.320 that rather than the entire process
00:09:53.800 beyond the fact that we'd be here all
00:09:55.079 day the other reason and I love this is
00:09:58.279 that closing has one of the highest
00:10:00.160 predictors of success in business and
00:10:02.680 here's an analogy for it everyone
00:10:04.680 familiar with the NFL yeah great so
00:10:07.880 here's an insane statistic the top five
00:10:10.519 Red Zone offenses in the league now last
00:10:14.680 five years made the playoffs 90% of the
00:10:17.760 time here's why this is interesting and
00:10:19.680 crazy there's a million other stats they
00:10:22.279 could have horrible defenses they could
00:10:24.480 have terrible coaching they could have a
00:10:26.440 terrible whatever it is right they could
00:10:27.880 have all these things that are wrong
00:10:28.959 with their they could have Terrible
00:10:30.079 Special Teams
00:10:31.440 whatever but just this one set if
00:10:35.000 they're in the Red Zone they [ __ ]
00:10:37.880 close and I can tell you if you have
00:10:40.240 this ability if you have this skill it
00:10:42.560 will make up for a tremendous amount of
00:10:44.560 deficiencies in other areas of your life
00:10:46.360 and business and it will buy you time to
00:10:49.040 learn those but if you can't close it's
00:10:51.839 very difficult to grow in business
00:10:53.880 especially in the beginning because it's
00:10:55.079 probably you that's why we're talking
00:10:56.760 about closing why is this important from
00:10:59.279 Money Getting
00:11:00.360 perspective well first off if you have
00:11:02.360 100 people walking the door 10% are
00:11:05.000 never going to buy just accept that
00:11:07.000 right problem is you don't know which
00:11:08.320 10% it
00:11:09.760 is but 10% are ever going to buy 10% are
00:11:13.360 always going to buy you just got to not
00:11:14.839 [ __ ] it up and most of you guys these
00:11:17.000 are the only sales you're getting
00:11:18.360 they're like well I already I'm already
00:11:20.000 here my friend told me about you I have
00:11:22.480 my credit card out and some of you like
00:11:24.160 well you know let's make sure you're
00:11:25.360 like just shut the [ __ ] just take the
00:11:26.760 card you know what I mean like shut up
00:11:29.000 right that's like hey my friend's so
00:11:31.200 awesome you got to meet him and she's
00:11:32.399 like oh my God he's great and then the
00:11:34.240 guy starts talking and she's like oh
00:11:35.519 just kidding you know
00:11:37.279 like terrible right but this is what we
00:11:40.800 fight for this is what we train and if
00:11:43.079 you want to make a big impact that's
00:11:45.279 what we're fighting for it's the middle
00:11:47.079 80 why this presentation will make you
00:11:49.200 money if after this presentation you
00:11:51.120 just have one more bullet one more play
00:11:53.560 In Your Arsenal to close where I get you
00:11:55.480 one more deal a month I'll feel like my
00:11:57.480 job was done all right and hopefully if
00:12:00.240 you just do that it'll pay for your
00:12:01.880 entire weekend all right that's my goal
00:12:03.440 for the presentation that everything
00:12:04.440 that you guys have done for this whole
00:12:05.560 weekend is paid for is that cool Fair
00:12:07.399 outcome all right so this is one of my
00:12:10.440 favorite sayings you're only one
00:12:12.880 decision away from changing your life
00:12:14.320 forever and whenever I feel overwhelmed
00:12:17.160 or I feel like I'm decreasing like I
00:12:18.560 feel powerless or I feel like I have
00:12:20.000 less power than I want to have I always
00:12:21.839 say this to myself because it's like I
00:12:23.800 can take one decision and change [ __ ]
00:12:25.560 everything you know what I mean like I
00:12:27.320 can I can drink a bottle of Jack get the
00:12:29.320 car I can change everything with one
00:12:31.600 decision right I can make a step to to
00:12:34.360 invest in something I can buy something
00:12:36.399 I can invest in myself I can I can have
00:12:38.079 a terrible conversation with Laya or I
00:12:39.600 can have amazing conversation with Lea
00:12:41.240 but just one decision and that's always
00:12:43.120 given me power but the thing is is that
00:12:45.279 instead of changing our lives we blame
00:12:48.480 when I say blame I want you to think
00:12:50.320 give power to sources outside of our
00:12:52.959 control and this is what you and this is
00:12:55.560 what your prospects and your customers
00:12:57.240 are doing and this is why so many people
00:12:59.519 are Weak and Powerless and so we're
00:13:01.880 going to do a fun activity today because
00:13:03.199 I want you to be involved so you can
00:13:04.199 learn it and we're going to do this so
00:13:05.839 that one you can help decisions to help
00:13:07.399 yourself with whatever decisions you're
00:13:08.680 facing two you can use these Frameworks
00:13:10.639 to help prospects help themselves and
00:13:13.079 then three become more powerful so but
00:13:15.800 rather than keep this hypothetical I
00:13:17.040 need you to visualize the decision that
00:13:18.399 you need to make all right can you do
00:13:20.480 that for me fantastic and this is why I
00:13:23.839 want you to actually think through a
00:13:25.680 decision together because this is a
00:13:28.560 statement from confusious I hear and I
00:13:30.360 forget I see and I remember I do and I
00:13:34.120 understand so my goal here isn't for you
00:13:35.839 to take screenshots of every picture of
00:13:37.959 every slide that's not my point here
00:13:39.279 because the thing is is when you do that
00:13:40.760 and you kind of I mean this is why I do
00:13:42.399 it I take pictures so that I don't have
00:13:44.480 to remember it but I don't want you to
00:13:46.160 remember it I want you to understand it
00:13:48.320 if you understand it you won't have to
00:13:50.160 go back to your notes because let's be
00:13:51.399 real half the time you're not even going
00:13:52.680 to open these notes up again you're here
00:13:54.399 now with me try and understand if you do
00:13:56.959 that it can change your life because
00:13:58.759 what we're going to do is not going to
00:13:59.839 be some scripts that you have to
00:14:01.000 understand but the logic behind the
00:14:03.040 arguments that people will give you as
00:14:04.759 to why they are not choosing to become
00:14:06.320 more powerful and if you can unlock that
00:14:08.160 you people will feel more powerful
00:14:09.720 talking to you and they will want to buy
00:14:11.480 from you because of the feeling they
00:14:12.920 have does that make sense and so that's
00:14:15.199 when you're using logic to create an
00:14:16.440 emotion so you here here's an easy one
00:14:19.240 for it anyone here presented with the
00:14:20.440 decision last 24 hours yes great
00:14:23.399 fantastic so who thinks the a decision
00:14:25.680 could change your life for the better
00:14:27.240 great for the worse knows all right
00:14:30.320 let's go so here's my goal I want to
00:14:32.279 show you as though you were Prospect how
00:14:33.759 to think through a decision and help
00:14:35.320 others using these Frameworks right what
00:14:36.800 you want what you don't want maximize
00:14:38.600 the left minimize the right so here's
00:14:40.759 what this is translated to if you decide
00:14:43.079 to buy the offer you feel more certain
00:14:44.639 about your decision if you decided not
00:14:45.720 to buy the offer you feel [ __ ]
00:14:46.880 certain about the decision and if you're
00:14:49.480 undecided you make a [ __ ] decision
00:14:52.079 all right and you feel good that it's
00:14:54.120 the one that has the highest likelihood
00:14:55.519 of you getting you close to where you
00:14:56.720 want to go and this is what we have to
00:14:58.560 walk through with with our prospects
00:15:00.480 when you're looking at them you have to
00:15:01.639 be like I don't want you to buy I want
00:15:04.880 you to decide for you not for me I'll be
00:15:07.519 the same either way right you're like
00:15:09.120 I'm going to be ripped and in shape it's
00:15:10.199 not going to change me right like that's
00:15:12.320 not going to change but like it will
00:15:13.959 change for you right so quick note on
00:15:16.680 sales ethics and then we'll dive in
00:15:18.240 helping someone make a decision to help
00:15:19.560 themselves does not mean buy from you
00:15:20.639 that's a reiteration you have to keep
00:15:22.399 their goals at the center of the
00:15:23.399 decision and you should be happy I mean
00:15:26.199 this because if you can shift this truly
00:15:29.279 if you can be happy when someone decides
00:15:31.360 to own the power and not work with you
00:15:33.800 then the pressure around sales
00:15:35.680 disappears it evaporates there's no
00:15:38.040 stake the stake is did I help them does
00:15:40.360 that make sense and that means that you
00:15:41.480 can win every sale because you change
00:15:43.680 the metric you're measuring Yourself by
00:15:45.600 that's the superpower like and that's
00:15:48.279 where you do make the most sales because
00:15:49.880 you don't care about the sale because
00:15:51.199 you care about the person and the people
00:15:53.600 pay the people who pay the most
00:15:54.959 attention so what I call it paying
00:15:56.480 attention they pay for it they pay for
00:15:58.519 you to pay attention rather than talking
00:15:59.800 about yourself right CU they don't care
00:16:01.839 about you cuz they're thinking about 100
00:16:03.440 other things and this is why most
00:16:05.720 importantly make high stakes decisions
00:16:08.360 to help your prospects in order to best
00:16:10.000 serve them okay so I told you earlier I
00:16:12.880 was going to talk about the difference
00:16:13.800 between obstacles and objections couple
00:16:15.839 of you guys raised your hands about the
00:16:18.120 differences I'm not going to ask I'll
00:16:19.839 tell you what it is obstacle is a thing
00:16:21.759 that blocks one's way or prevents or
00:16:23.920 hinders progress when you disagree with
00:16:27.920 them that is an obstacle this happens
00:16:31.040 before you solicit the sale someone says
00:16:33.920 some [ __ ] before you even get to the
00:16:35.519 sale that's an obstacle a simple example
00:16:38.360 I hear all the time hey why'd you hop on
00:16:40.199 the call today hey why'd you walk in the
00:16:41.639 gym today whatever it is right them I
00:16:44.519 just wanted to find out a little bit
00:16:45.440 more about the program first 10 seconds
00:16:48.519 obstacle you're not here to find out
00:16:50.279 more about the program I'm here cuz
00:16:51.240 you're fat but they got to say it so
00:16:54.480 you're like oh so you finding out like
00:16:56.279 do you do this all the time do you go to
00:16:57.480 lots of different programs it's find out
00:16:59.199 information or is there a problem you're
00:17:00.279 trying to solve they're like oh well you
00:17:02.800 know I'm trying to lose weight like oh
00:17:04.240 got it so you're not just hopping on 100
00:17:05.439 calls a day cuz I was like that would be
00:17:06.480 a very weird existence right you just
00:17:08.039 hop on for information all day ha great
00:17:12.400 fantastic I've had this conversation
00:17:14.439 before right so that's an obstacle right
00:17:17.720 and the thing is it's easy to confront
00:17:19.359 and Destroy obstacles before you ask for
00:17:22.000 the sale once you've asked for the sale
00:17:24.839 you switch to objections objections is
00:17:27.359 when they disagree with you do so it's
00:17:29.960 much easier to be on the other side
00:17:31.760 disagreeing and helping them break their
00:17:33.080 beliefs before the stake has been
00:17:35.320 presented after after the after you're
00:17:37.679 in the Red Zone it's all closing it's
00:17:39.600 all objection overcomes right example
00:17:41.799 that like I don't want to buy right now
00:17:43.320 and you're like totally understand what
00:17:45.280 are the main criteria you're thinking
00:17:46.360 through which is always funny because
00:17:48.080 people are like I need to think about
00:17:49.160 I've never had someone like leave
00:17:50.400 because they need to think about it I'm
00:17:51.559 like cool what are you thinking
00:17:53.200 about and they're like oh I'm still
00:17:56.840 here right like so learning how to talk
00:17:59.600 through these high stakes decisions with
00:18:00.840 yourself or others is the purpose of
00:18:02.000 presentation and as a result you'll
00:18:03.159 become more powerful okay so before I
00:18:05.320 dive into these AR each of these
00:18:06.520 arguments I have to make this one
00:18:08.240 statement is that the person must really
00:18:09.919 want the
00:18:11.000 goal and believe three things one which
00:18:15.520 you'll get to it there we go the product
00:18:17.159 will get them the goal comma the way
00:18:19.320 they want to get there and I learned
00:18:21.159 that second half the hard way because we
00:18:23.600 found out in gym launch that people
00:18:26.320 would say no sometimes to buying
00:18:27.679 memberships right or buying challenges
00:18:29.679 or whatever but when we offered them the
00:18:31.799 ability to come back the next day help
00:18:33.400 them for free we'd sell them $400 of
00:18:36.080 supplements and they just said no to a
00:18:37.679 $100 down service thing I'm like what
00:18:40.840 the [ __ ] it's because they want to lose
00:18:43.799 weight but they want to lose weight
00:18:45.559 their
00:18:46.440 way and so that's when I started
00:18:48.159 learning like oh not only do we have to
00:18:50.240 make sure that they want the goal and
00:18:52.280 they believe that the product's going to
00:18:53.480 get them there it has to get them there
00:18:55.000 the way they want to get there this
00:18:56.520 gives you ammo for the questions that
00:18:58.000 you're going to ask does this make sense
00:19:00.480 okay the second thing is that you and
00:19:03.480 others will support them like are you
00:19:05.679 telling me the truth is this really
00:19:07.000 what's going to happen will other people
00:19:08.480 around me support this decision and the
00:19:11.320 third is that it will work for them and
00:19:13.520 not just everyone else sure I've seen
00:19:16.440 the people who step on the stage but
00:19:18.880 they're different than me I'm a
00:19:20.640 snowflake I have metabolic thyroid keto
00:19:23.760 osis right whatever I have zero
00:19:26.880 influence oler whatever you know what I
00:19:29.120 mean like I have no following is itis
00:19:31.919 right whatever it is right whatever
00:19:33.840 [ __ ] you tell yourself and what you
00:19:35.880 have to do in this situation you have to
00:19:37.320 Pride proof so that it'd be more
00:19:38.840 unreasonable not to believe than to
00:19:40.200 believe and this is a logical close this
00:19:42.760 is not a this is not an emotional close
00:19:45.200 this is when you look at someone and say
00:19:47.360 how many people would you need to see
00:19:49.360 for it to be more unreasonable for you
00:19:50.640 not to believe than to believe at what
00:19:52.480 point is it 10 is it 50 here's a
00:19:56.559 thousand tell me when to stop
00:19:59.240 okay okay okay great so that's not the
00:20:01.280 real reason and then you can confront
00:20:03.120 the real [ __ ] all right so otherwise if
00:20:05.159 they're not sure of those things if they
00:20:07.000 don't actually want to lose weight if
00:20:08.320 you don't actually want to make money
00:20:10.320 doing online fitness then it doesn't
00:20:12.480 matter what Jason says you don't want to
00:20:14.400 make money doing online fitness then
00:20:15.880 you're not going to buy right if you do
00:20:18.200 want to make money doing online fitness
00:20:20.080 then you go down you go down the Train
00:20:21.400 the train tracks that make sense okay
00:20:23.880 again this is why you expect no at first
00:20:25.880 because if people could make the
00:20:26.760 decision they would have already made it
00:20:28.159 all right out of the main course Richard
00:20:30.240 feeman besides Charlie one of my
00:20:32.200 favorite thinkers of all time he was
00:20:33.520 like the second guy on uh the atom bomb
00:20:36.120 sounds negative brilliant teacher he's
00:20:37.880 known for this understand don't memorize
00:20:40.159 learn principles not formulas and that's
00:20:41.600 what the rest of this presentation is
00:20:42.600 about is the principles behind
00:20:45.400 overcoming these distortions that people
00:20:48.080 have and so this is me asking you for
00:20:49.799 your own sake don't take pictures of the
00:20:51.480 slides it's because all the stuff's
00:20:52.960 going to be in the recordings but you
00:20:54.120 are here now so be here now so you can
00:20:56.080 understand it okay so there are three
00:20:59.760 sources this is a huge breakthrough for
00:21:02.159 me so I'm going to share it with you
00:21:03.120 this first time try share to life there
00:21:04.840 are three sources that we cast our power
00:21:06.600 to okay and it took me a very long time
00:21:09.200 to get through this because I looked at
00:21:11.440 Grant and he had his you know you got
00:21:13.480 stall decision maker money then you talk
00:21:16.200 to Barry who owns Sage she's like you
00:21:18.120 got time fit uh money fear shame right
00:21:22.720 those are hers and then Jordan Belford's
00:21:24.279 got his and so everybody's got like
00:21:25.880 these are the only overcomes right I was
00:21:27.640 like there has to be
00:21:29.039 an actual truth here like there has to
00:21:31.000 be something that's true that's
00:21:32.799 uned and so trying to figure this out I
00:21:36.080 actually went back to Dr Albert Ellis
00:21:38.559 anybody who know who he is no one great
00:21:41.520 um who here knows what cognitive
00:21:43.080 behavioral therapy is CBT he invented it
00:21:46.760 smart
00:21:48.240 dude and so what he noticed is that he
00:21:50.799 originally had 11 distortions of reality
00:21:53.120 then he dropped it to nine then to seven
00:21:55.760 and then he came to three and the three
00:21:57.600 stuck and the three are what I'm about
00:21:59.320 to share with you you're like why is he
00:22:00.480 talking about this about sales because
00:22:02.440 the objections that people offer you
00:22:03.919 where they cast their power to are
00:22:05.600 distortions of
00:22:07.159 reality they are the things we use to
00:22:09.240 upset
00:22:10.559 ourselves these are the three
00:22:13.120 circumstances and this is the irrational
00:22:15.120 statement that people make I must get
00:22:17.720 what I want when I want it I must not
00:22:20.039 get what I don't want if I don't get
00:22:21.919 what I want I can't stand it that's when
00:22:24.799 people blame their emotional
00:22:25.840 disturbances on emotional disturbances
00:22:28.200 on circumstances two others other people
00:22:31.960 must treat me fairly and kindly and if I
00:22:33.880 if they don't they are no good and
00:22:35.080 deserve to be condemned and punished
00:22:37.480 it's like your animal brain right three
00:22:41.080 self I must do well or else I am no good
00:22:44.120 these are the three core distortions
00:22:45.840 that upset people this is like mental
00:22:48.039 illness right and so I'm not saying
00:22:50.720 anyone has mental illness if they don't
00:22:51.799 agree with you it's more so that these
00:22:53.360 are distortions that are not real and if
00:22:56.159 you can understand not memorize if you
00:22:58.320 can understand this then you can have
00:23:00.120 these high stakes conversations
00:23:01.559 understanding exactly which Distortion
00:23:03.400 they're suffering from and I'll show you
00:23:04.799 how to overcome them okay and so I like
00:23:07.520 to consider like the onion of blame
00:23:09.480 people this is like one of the bigger
00:23:10.919 breakthroughs I had they start with the
00:23:12.919 outside they blame
00:23:15.000 circumstances time money other [ __ ] and
00:23:18.840 then the step next to that they start to
00:23:20.720 blame other people my spouse my kids my
00:23:22.799 employees and then finally they say like
00:23:25.159 it's me it's my fault and so you might
00:23:28.240 have to overcome multiple layers as you
00:23:30.600 peel back and based on the objection
00:23:33.080 they give you you can know where you're
00:23:35.120 at you can know how close you are if
00:23:36.880 someone just says I have to think about
00:23:38.039 you're like great I'm talking to the
00:23:39.400 person who's in power and the decision
00:23:40.880 maker and I just need to get them to say
00:23:42.480 yes if they're like I don't have they're
00:23:45.600 casting the power away and some of you
00:23:47.480 guys are probably casting your power
00:23:48.840 away on decisions you need to make which
00:23:50.480 is why I'm making this presentation even
00:23:52.400 though that these are the things that
00:23:53.480 distort people's realities cuz you're
00:23:54.720 like no one's ever said circumstances
00:23:56.360 are getting in my way right like no says
00:23:58.720 that right they manifest in five ways
00:24:01.039 that I want to equip you to deal with
00:24:02.679 all right for yourself and others so
00:24:05.080 these are the five most common excuses
00:24:07.679 scapegoats that people use for circum
00:24:10.679 and if you find other ones these are the
00:24:12.360 biggest buckets because I didn't want to
00:24:13.520 have a hundred things here but the big
00:24:14.679 three buckets are circumstances others
00:24:16.559 and self right but they manifest with
00:24:19.760 time in multiple ways and I'll show you
00:24:21.440 how value price money Etc fit I'm a
00:24:25.120 special snowflake others which is I
00:24:27.000 don't have the authority to make the
00:24:28.000 decision
00:24:29.159 and then finally self which is what if I
00:24:31.919 just don't make the decision let some
00:24:33.520 let life make it for me right avoidance
00:24:35.880 stall you go from surface level to core
00:24:39.200 and as a side note you should never get
00:24:41.640 stuck on the stuff near the top and
00:24:43.880 ideally you really never get stuck
00:24:45.480 anywhere on this equation if the person
00:24:47.399 wants what you have and you truly
00:24:49.679 believe in what you have to help them
00:24:51.880 and I mean that like if you understand
00:24:54.159 this thoroughly you can walk someone
00:24:56.080 towards helping themselves okay okay
00:24:58.880 this is what they look like or this is
00:25:00.080 what they sound like in
00:25:01.399 reality not a good not a good time right
00:25:03.760 now I'm really busy right that's time
00:25:07.279 can't afford it too expensive fit not
00:25:10.159 sure if it's for me I hate broccoli I
00:25:12.279 can't do a plan with broccoli right
00:25:14.480 can't do a plan where I have to DM
00:25:15.679 people every day it's against my brand
00:25:17.120 I'm poor but it's against my brand right
00:25:20.360 Authority have to talk to my partner
00:25:22.520 spouse I have to talk to somebody who
00:25:23.600 has more power than me it's funny
00:25:25.080 because when you start thinking this way
00:25:26.240 it sounds silly
00:25:28.480 and then avoidance I need to think about
00:25:30.039 it clearly let's think about it now all
00:25:32.640 right and so I told you I want you to
00:25:34.120 think about the principles Behind these
00:25:35.480 things not memorize you've got
00:25:37.960 circumstances you got other people and
00:25:39.919 you have yourself and we drill down so
00:25:43.000 quick test who here is physically in the
00:25:44.600 room raise your wonderful arms are
00:25:47.159 working we're rocking so here's my ask
00:25:50.559 raise your hand if you or your prospects
00:25:53.159 present with this
00:25:56.000 Distortion so who here is a Time person
00:25:58.399 I'm busy it's not a good time maybe in
00:25:59.960 the future anyone deal with these
00:26:01.840 sometimes it's yourself totally so I'm
00:26:04.159 also going to tell you a secret about
00:26:05.640 this I think the reason I got pretty
00:26:08.080 decent at logical arguments is because I
00:26:11.039 am inherently skeptical and I will
00:26:12.760 paralyze myself from not doing anything
00:26:15.000 unless I have really sound reasons to do
00:26:17.159 it and I realized that I couldn't move
00:26:18.679 forward to make any progress in my life
00:26:20.240 until I had these Frameworks to think
00:26:22.360 through these hard decisions through so
00:26:23.760 I could start taking steps to where I
00:26:25.200 where I wanted to go it took me years to
00:26:27.240 get there and so so hopefully I can give
00:26:29.399 you some keys that help me unlock my own
00:26:31.559 head to get out of my own [ __ ] way so
00:26:33.399 that you can too and help your clients
00:26:34.880 all right so the way I think about time
00:26:37.440 and there's a lot of overcomes for all
00:26:39.799 of these things what I tried to do is
00:26:41.720 Bunch the three biggest ones that I like
00:26:43.760 to use most frequently and if I uh Veer
00:26:46.880 from like the the bullets on the screen
00:26:48.880 it's because I'm riffing with you and
00:26:49.880 I'd rather just kind of stay in the flow
00:26:51.159 is that cool okay fantastic so when
00:26:53.880 you're overcoming this one each of these
00:26:56.200 is kind of a specific angle that you're
00:26:57.799 attacking it from so macro is like I'm
00:27:01.320 this is a busy season for me got lots of
00:27:03.760 stuff going on right micro is like I
00:27:06.720 don't have any time in my day so you're
00:27:08.840 one person is saying I've got lots of
00:27:09.960 [ __ ] going on one person's like I can't
00:27:11.600 find the time it's different sounds
00:27:13.440 subtle but it's both about time but in
00:27:14.880 different ways all right and then the
00:27:17.039 the last one is well when when I have
00:27:19.320 time I'll start right everyone know this
00:27:22.080 [ __ ] horeshit but whatever okay so as
00:27:24.880 always we never disagree with prospects
00:27:26.840 because you're not in a fight
00:27:28.720 totally get it totally understand do you
00:27:31.399 think like do you want this to be
00:27:33.240 something that lasts for the long term
00:27:35.600 right it's a question you're like yeah
00:27:37.559 do you think that you're going to be
00:27:38.440 busy again in the future well yeah so
00:27:42.159 you want this to last in the long run
00:27:43.440 and you do think you're going to be busy
00:27:44.600 again in the future well then don't you
00:27:46.399 think it'd be best to start now when you
00:27:48.519 are busy because if you learn how to do
00:27:49.919 it when you're busy you'll be able to do
00:27:51.279 it forever if you can only learn it
00:27:52.799 during a perfect circumstance then
00:27:54.240 you're going to fall off when it gets
00:27:55.159 busy again and isn't that the time you'd
00:27:56.960 want to have the most support goes for
00:27:58.760 you guys too that's just number one we
00:28:01.240 got so many lore right and so when you
00:28:05.399 knock that out the goal is that the
00:28:07.000 person says well [ __ ] that's not a good
00:28:08.559 reason and you take one step towards the
00:28:10.960 truth so when you're thinking about it's
00:28:12.840 not like oh I've got to overcome this
00:28:14.159 one thing and then they'll buy you got
00:28:16.159 to keep peeling and if you have this
00:28:18.240 framework you understand the direction
00:28:19.880 you're going in and you can start
00:28:21.320 listening for the oh they're talking
00:28:22.600 about themselves now I've gotten two
00:28:24.039 layers deeper right so that's seasonal
00:28:27.360 micro you can't tell someone in a sale
00:28:29.880 hey take out your phone take out your
00:28:32.039 hours by week pull it up oh look 22
00:28:34.679 hours on social media this week you've
00:28:37.000 got time so you say it differently you
00:28:39.120 say you know what I had the same issue
00:28:40.880 and I used to complain all the time
00:28:41.840 about like how I didn't have time to to
00:28:43.120 be successful and do things I needed to
00:28:44.399 do and my wife got so sick and tired of
00:28:46.399 me saying this she pulled my phone out
00:28:47.760 and she was like look I guess I just
00:28:49.640 found your time didn't I I was like ah
00:28:51.840 [ __ ] and you can say it that way and
00:28:53.600 then a prospect feels better does
00:28:55.320 anybody here feel like they don't have
00:28:56.440 time right
00:28:58.960 and the first thing that any program is
00:29:01.240 going to do if it's a good program is
00:29:02.919 going to cut out the 90% of the [ __ ]
00:29:04.279 that you are doing which is causing you
00:29:05.679 to feel overwhelmed which is probably
00:29:07.279 the real reason you feel like you don't
00:29:08.760 have time Jeff basil got the same time
00:29:10.559 you do right it's just what are the
00:29:13.200 things that you're doing that he's not
00:29:14.960 it's not about adding [ __ ] to your plate
00:29:16.320 it's about removing the stuff that's not
00:29:17.480 working because clearly everything
00:29:18.760 you're doing that's filling your time is
00:29:20.159 not making you more money so you're
00:29:21.640 doing the wrong [ __ ] so there's going to
00:29:23.480 be plenty of time because all the stuff
00:29:25.080 you're doing now is not working right
00:29:27.799 not simple but that's the reason right
00:29:30.559 so we went
00:29:32.840 mael when then hey in the future when
00:29:37.880 I've got time I'll totally sign up for
00:29:39.200 your program right anyone heard this one
00:29:42.360 anyone say this
00:29:43.760 one right and again you want to you want
00:29:46.519 to empathize you don't say like Ah
00:29:48.399 that's [ __ ] you say totally
00:29:50.120 understand that's I was stuck like this
00:29:51.200 for years if you can step in their shoes
00:29:52.960 you're not attacking them you actually
00:29:54.120 go from the inside out you step into
00:29:56.200 their self and then you walk them
00:29:57.720 through the Epiphany that you
00:29:59.240 experienced and it doesn't feel
00:30:00.919 judgmental it feels helpful that make
00:30:02.760 sense I used to feel the same way right
00:30:05.519 and I found this out actually from Jason
00:30:07.679 Flatley and he was the one who told me
00:30:08.840 this it's a it's a logical fallacy it's
00:30:10.640 called the when then fallacy which is
00:30:11.880 why that's how I remember it and the
00:30:14.120 onein fallacy simply States when I have
00:30:16.960 X then I will do y but it flips sequence
00:30:20.440 so it's like when I get better I will go
00:30:22.200 to the
00:30:23.200 hospital sorry there's just so many like
00:30:25.679 hilarious ones about like money and
00:30:27.159 stuff like I start saving money once I'm
00:30:29.039 rich like all right but the thing is is
00:30:31.720 that we do this right we do this I'll
00:30:36.519 pay for the program that'll make me more
00:30:37.960 money when I have more
00:30:39.720 money that's the point of the program
00:30:42.080 I'll pay for the program that'll help me
00:30:43.440 get a sixpack once I have a
00:30:45.120 six-pack once I have more time which the
00:30:47.519 program is going to help me have you
00:30:48.360 know what I'm saying like it's just it
00:30:49.360 doesn't make it's a fallacy and so what
00:30:51.399 that means is it's a distortion it's not
00:30:54.519 real and so the goal of having these
00:30:56.919 high stakes conversations is simply
00:30:58.519 showing people we're not attacking we're
00:31:01.200 just walking them through it and be like
00:31:02.519 do you realize that this is holding you
00:31:04.200 back and I know this better than anyone
00:31:06.399 because I'm a skeptical [ __ ] the
00:31:07.919 reason I can do all these logical things
00:31:09.279 is because I'm the first person I'd
00:31:10.799 overcome right and you might be
00:31:14.440 too so once we attack time from these
00:31:18.240 three angles it depends which one they
00:31:19.399 present with if they present with one
00:31:20.480 and then move to the next you can knock
00:31:21.559 all three out you'll probably find some
00:31:23.159 that that make the most sense to you but
00:31:24.600 the thing here is it's not about
00:31:25.880 memorization you just got to get it
00:31:28.039 macro you're always going to be busy
00:31:29.679 once you want the most help when you are
00:31:31.480 busy so that it can stick forever yes
00:31:33.799 time my wife showed me my phone turns
00:31:36.679 out I got [ __ ] time but the reality
00:31:38.440 is it's not about what I am doing it's
00:31:40.240 about the stuff I got to stop doing and
00:31:41.919 that's what I'm going help you with
00:31:43.480 right this isn't scripting this is just
00:31:45.799 understanding it right and then when
00:31:47.760 then it's a fallacy it's a distortion
00:31:49.720 it's not real and then just use two
00:31:51.080 crazy examples like once I have money
00:31:53.399 then or I'll save money when I'm rich
00:31:55.000 right it's just like ridiculous okay so
00:31:57.320 what do we do
00:31:58.720 one reason down and we're getting closer
00:32:01.200 to the core right right so who here is
00:32:05.360 somebody who's like I can't afford it
00:32:06.679 it's too expensive or has heard this
00:32:07.960 from a prospect I like I better see
00:32:10.360 everybody's
00:32:12.000 hand especially if you're selling High
00:32:13.880 ticket which hopefully you get a gasp so
00:32:15.720 these are the four Frameworks that I
00:32:16.919 think through there's a million like
00:32:18.440 money closes but these are the ones that
00:32:20.320 I like the most and that that to me
00:32:23.720 resonate the best right and so why a lot
00:32:27.120 is good is kind of like my my my first
00:32:29.519 one here and so the reason that if
00:32:31.799 someone gasps or think that this is a
00:32:34.159 lot of money you just ask them is this a
00:32:35.519 lot of money to you and they're going to
00:32:37.000 say yeah if they say no then you're like
00:32:38.679 awesome buy it and if they say yes right
00:32:41.880 and if they say yes then you're like
00:32:44.120 that's the exact reason how you're going
00:32:45.120 to be successful because there's other
00:32:47.080 people who buy this thing and you know
00:32:48.760 what they're not all in on it but the
00:32:50.399 question is do you want to draw the line
00:32:51.360 in the sand and go all in do you want to
00:32:52.559 step over the line and be the person you
00:32:53.919 want to be because I can tell you that
00:32:56.000 this is not about what whether this
00:32:58.080 works or not I've already proven that
00:32:59.360 the question is whether you work or not
00:33:01.240 and so if you put more on the line then
00:33:03.760 you have a higher likelihood of being
00:33:05.039 successful so you should be the last
00:33:06.720 person to be worried about this I'm more
00:33:08.480 excited because the best stories are
00:33:09.639 always coming from people like you in
00:33:11.320 your exact situation so don't let that
00:33:13.360 be a reason not to do it that should be
00:33:14.399 the reason to do it so the next one is
00:33:16.880 like why is this not a lot so first is
00:33:19.399 the fact that it's a lot for you is good
00:33:21.279 it means you're going to try hard the
00:33:23.519 second one is like well it's a lot in
00:33:25.399 terms of absolute amount but relative
00:33:27.399 amount very little right because if all
00:33:29.639 this does is ADD $10,000 a month to your
00:33:32.600 income is it worth it if all this does
00:33:35.600 is get you into a bikini is it worth it
00:33:39.000 yeah and so then what happens and the
00:33:41.399 reason that this is a stepping process
00:33:43.559 right is that we're we're just taking
00:33:45.840 these objections out of the way so we
00:33:47.399 can get the person to confront reality
00:33:49.120 not a distortion they've created because
00:33:50.799 the reality is the thing they're afraid
00:33:52.120 of and so what happens is when they say
00:33:54.639 yeah if it did that it would be worth it
00:33:57.480 right the problem is they don't believe
00:33:59.440 you right and so it's like great then
00:34:02.760 it's not about the price it's about
00:34:04.600 whether you believe me so you can
00:34:05.760 sidestep it does that make sense we're
00:34:07.039 taking a step closer and then obviously
00:34:09.280 you can use a comparison you know
00:34:10.760 depending on what you're selling if you
00:34:12.159 can price anchor with like well here
00:34:14.239 they don't have a four-year degree for
00:34:16.000 doing online fitness that's why the
00:34:18.119 alternative education industry exists
00:34:20.839 and it's because the formal education
00:34:22.320 has failed most of us right anybody
00:34:24.679 graduate with here with a 4-year degree
00:34:26.918 anyone immediately be able to use that
00:34:28.239 for degree to get leads make
00:34:30.639 sales no me
00:34:33.280 neither right and what's crazy is that
00:34:36.440 some of these degrees are 501
00:34:38.639 $200,000 and take four years when you've
00:34:41.639 got something that can help you make
00:34:43.719 make that entire amount of money in half
00:34:46.000 the time right for a tenth of the price
00:34:48.960 when you think about it like that frame
00:34:51.159 it's actually a great deal does that
00:34:52.199 make sense so you just frame it you have
00:34:54.440 to give context all right so number one
00:34:58.280 is the fact that it's a lot for you is
00:34:59.880 good means you're actually going to try
00:35:02.000 number two is if it does what we say
00:35:03.560 it's it's going to do the value is there
00:35:06.079 so that's not actually what you're
00:35:07.280 opposed to which then we can take the
00:35:08.520 next step all right number three is
00:35:11.079 what's money good for anyways this is
00:35:12.920 actually one of my favorite lines of
00:35:15.240 reasoning for a variety of reasons and
00:35:17.200 I'll get to it when you're looking at a
00:35:18.920 prospect or looking at yourself you're
00:35:21.160 going to spend this money either way
00:35:22.599 over the next 12 months you're going to
00:35:24.520 spend it right and in fact not only
00:35:27.400 you're going to spend it you're going to
00:35:29.040 buy the program the question is whether
00:35:30.760 you're going to pay for it in money or
00:35:31.839 pay for it in time and so like you can
00:35:34.160 learn every single lesson that's in this
00:35:36.280 program whether it's losing weight you
00:35:38.599 know uh getting leads selling online
00:35:41.000 whatever it is right you're going to
00:35:42.520 learn these lessons but do you want it
00:35:44.119 to take 12 weeks or 12 years and the
00:35:49.000 question is are you going to be able to
00:35:49.839 live a thousand lifetimes because of the
00:35:51.800 thousand people that we've helped just
00:35:52.960 like you and gathered all those lessons
00:35:54.960 and put them together so you don't have
00:35:56.200 to do the trial and error for that
00:35:57.599 entire period of time so the question is
00:35:59.079 not whether you're going to buy it or
00:36:00.560 not it's just how do you want to pay and
00:36:02.520 so for me this is a personal note and I
00:36:05.079 I'll probably say it at the end but like
00:36:06.960 the reason we've been don't move quickly
00:36:08.160 through life is that I will buy other
00:36:09.400 people's mistakes because it's just it's
00:36:11.440 the only way you can buy time in this
00:36:13.839 life is to buy the knowledge to take
00:36:15.920 less time from other people who have
00:36:17.839 taken their time and like if you think
00:36:19.440 about human civilization in general Edis
00:36:21.720 took however long to make a light bulb
00:36:23.240 and then we just bought the lesson from
00:36:24.480 him and now we have light bulbs right
00:36:26.000 and the next guy figures out the next
00:36:27.359 thing and then we just buy the lesson
00:36:28.880 from him and that's how we have to move
00:36:30.680 faster so you're going to spend the
00:36:32.319 money either way question is 12 months
00:36:34.079 from now is it going to be on [ __ ] that
00:36:35.119 didn't get you anymore or stuff that is
00:36:36.440 going to get you somewhere and no matter
00:36:37.720 what you're buying you're buying the
00:36:39.560 program just going to pay time or you're
00:36:40.720 going to pay with
00:36:42.319 money and if you're being real you've
00:36:44.720 probably been paying for time the last
00:36:46.599 six years how's that working for you do
00:36:48.240 you want to do more of that this is also
00:36:50.280 this is a this is a classic one it's
00:36:51.560 very easy one to remember but like who
00:36:54.400 here knows the difference between a
00:36:57.640 self-made billionaire when they had
00:36:59.359 nothing and where you're at right now if
00:37:01.480 you have nothing zero they both you're
00:37:04.720 both broke they were broke you're broke
00:37:07.400 whatever it is if that's where you're at
00:37:08.599 right now the only difference is that
00:37:10.599 that proves that if they were successful
00:37:12.960 it wasn't about the resources they had
00:37:15.359 is about how resourceful they were so
00:37:17.599 I'll tell you a quick story about this
00:37:19.040 so anyone here read uh shoe
00:37:21.480 dog right story of Nike so in the story
00:37:24.800 he talks about how he was about to lose
00:37:28.079 everything multiple times it's a crazy
00:37:30.040 story and this time it was like it was
00:37:33.119 it was going to go down like it wasn't
00:37:34.280 going to happen and he needed a
00:37:35.760 tremendous amount of money and he just
00:37:37.040 didn't have it he' extended all his
00:37:38.119 credit lines the banks wouldn't do it
00:37:39.560 and the next lenders said they they
00:37:40.680 canceled on him and the company was
00:37:42.640 going to fold because it was growing too
00:37:43.800 fast at that point he could have just
00:37:45.839 given up and said there's nothing I can
00:37:46.920 do I maxed out all my cards I maxed out
00:37:48.280 all my Banks there's literally nothing I
00:37:49.640 can do and his people had already worked
00:37:51.480 for free they were like we can't do this
00:37:53.920 anymore he went to his vendors and said
00:37:57.200 you need need to pay my payroll for me
00:37:59.280 he went to his
00:38:00.800 vendors anybody use like landing page
00:38:02.960 software anyone or anyone use something
00:38:04.960 from a vendor right it's like going to
00:38:07.359 that guy like going to your videographer
00:38:08.560 and be like listen you got to pay
00:38:09.440 payroll for me this uh this month
00:38:11.599 because otherwise I'm not going to be
00:38:12.680 able to keep doing business with you
00:38:14.000 because I'll be out of business
00:38:15.960 resourceful not
00:38:17.960 resources and the reason this is so
00:38:19.760 important is because when you have
00:38:20.839 nothing it's the easiest excuse to give
00:38:22.720 yourself is you're like well I have
00:38:24.480 nothing that's why I can't it's like of
00:38:26.480 course but every self made millionaire
00:38:28.000 and every self-made millionaire was
00:38:29.720 self-made and they started with nothing
00:38:31.680 which puts them in the exact same seat
00:38:33.000 you are so the question is do you want
00:38:34.720 to have power or do you want to not have
00:38:37.079 power you want to have power you're
00:38:39.560 resourceful not resources right and so
00:38:42.240 if we want to make these decisions that
00:38:43.319 are going to help ourselves we need to
00:38:45.240 step into that and so when you're
00:38:46.440 talking to your prospects it's the same
00:38:48.400 thing right does that make sense okay
00:38:52.119 rocking I mean and you can drill deeper
00:38:54.440 into this as like do you think there's
00:38:55.880 anyone else who's been in your situ
00:38:57.440 situation who's achieved this or maybe
00:38:59.640 worse than your situation the answer is
00:39:01.520 yes and if they can why can't you right
00:39:04.359 so we're taking steps closer is are you
00:39:05.839 guys digging this okay
00:39:08.839 cool oh
00:39:11.640 thanks
00:39:14.680 thanks I wasn't sure if it was WRA
00:39:16.960 attention or sheer boredom so we're not
00:39:20.680 you feel you feel we're progress are
00:39:22.359 making like the person presents this say
00:39:23.920 I don't have time shit's busy blah blah
00:39:25.880 and you're like nope Noe we're going to
00:39:27.599 take one step Clos they like you know
00:39:28.880 what but I I don't have the money or
00:39:30.680 it's too expensive you're like well if
00:39:32.640 you don't have the money you're going to
00:39:33.800 be successful it's worth it right yes I
00:39:36.400 understand why it's worth it well you
00:39:37.319 don't need money to begin with right you
00:39:39.920 got to be resourceful and you can find
00:39:41.280 the money cuz I'll ask you this is a fun
00:39:43.680 one for business owners who here has had
00:39:46.240 an unexpected bill ever come
00:39:48.480 up
00:39:50.200 taxes right yeah and then all okay so
00:39:54.880 everyone here is still alive who raised
00:39:56.599 their hands
00:39:58.200 who here was able to magically pull
00:40:00.920 money out of their ass and figure out a
00:40:03.319 way to do it raise your
00:40:06.000 hand here's what's crazy you have the
00:40:09.480 ability to be resourceful when it's for
00:40:11.200 someone
00:40:12.640 else and not for
00:40:15.440 you it's because you choose to be
00:40:17.480 powerful when someone else needs it but
00:40:19.240 not for
00:40:20.480 yourself [ __ ] up right so stop doing
00:40:24.520 that if you function like you you have
00:40:27.520 to make payroll tomorrow and like you
00:40:30.079 you're back on rent you're going to get
00:40:31.599 kicked out you think differently and if
00:40:34.240 instead of paying your landlord you're
00:40:35.520 paying you because that's what you want
00:40:37.160 to do it shifts internally because
00:40:39.640 everyone here just Prov the fact that
00:40:41.079 you can be resourceful when you choose
00:40:42.560 to
00:40:43.599 be so just choose to be so number three
00:40:47.720 is it's not not sure it's a fit for me
00:40:50.079 so be besides the obvious ones which is
00:40:52.359 like I don't want to work out broccoli
00:40:55.000 sucks I I can't do a program where
00:40:58.079 where I I can't do cardio whatever the
00:41:00.079 [ __ ] right um like I said I don't want
00:41:02.240 to do DMs I don't want to post on
00:41:03.520 Instagram I don't want to have a
00:41:04.319 Facebook group whatever right whatever
00:41:05.680 the [ __ ] is all right I'm not sure
00:41:07.319 if the vehicle is a fit for me so
00:41:10.880 usually you can overcome the easy ones
00:41:12.480 but if someone is just really sticking
00:41:14.400 hard these are the three that I use to
00:41:16.880 to shift perspective okay so this one is
00:41:19.839 new identity new priorities so it's good
00:41:23.200 to have cues for these things which is
00:41:24.560 like we vote with our dollars about the
00:41:25.680 things that we care about and if you
00:41:27.319 show me what someone is spending their
00:41:28.680 money and their time on I can tell you
00:41:29.839 what their future is and I'll tell you
00:41:31.640 an interesting story so um I had
00:41:33.760 somebody who was just like you who was
00:41:35.560 like you know what I don't want to do
00:41:36.480 this either and I told her this story
00:41:37.920 can I tell you it yes and this is what
00:41:40.280 you'd say to the prospect right so I was
00:41:42.760 with Lea and we went to Sephora which is
00:41:45.640 a makeup store
00:41:48.680 and and I show up like this um I feel
00:41:52.960 welcomed and so we're we're standing
00:41:54.839 there she's doing something and I
00:41:56.040 usually stand in the corner like this
00:41:58.680 um and I saw these two little girls it
00:42:01.160 might have been like I don't know girl
00:42:02.640 age so like 12 to 15 this like this this
00:42:07.480 and they were like giggly and so excited
00:42:09.599 and they had like the girl with the smok
00:42:11.359 came over was like helping her out
00:42:12.800 helping them out and she was like okay
00:42:15.720 this is like eyeliner and this is
00:42:17.839 lipstick and this is whatever blush um
00:42:20.880 I'm just like using words I've heard
00:42:23.240 uh this is how you paint your face and
00:42:25.880 the thing is the girls were like so
00:42:27.400 excited and then they were like right
00:42:29.000 before they left she was like girls
00:42:30.680 she's like you have to remember like now
00:42:32.440 that you're getting older and you're
00:42:33.680 becoming a woman you need to start
00:42:35.359 budging for this stuff all right so
00:42:36.760 you're going to start buying this every
00:42:37.800 month all right so like remember you got
00:42:39.400 to save some money for this so you can
00:42:40.480 have it and the girls were so excited
00:42:43.200 that they were like yes like we're
00:42:44.720 becoming women now and these are the
00:42:45.839 things that women do it's because when
00:42:47.760 you have new identity you have new
00:42:49.960 priorities and so you've had priorities
00:42:52.400 that are aligned with your old identity
00:42:54.359 right there's the you that goes out the
00:42:55.720 you that drinks the you that does the BL
00:42:57.240 blah blah blah blah spends money on [ __ ]
00:42:58.359 you shouldn't do spends time on [ __ ] you
00:42:59.680 shouldn't be spending time on and
00:43:01.040 there's the you that you want to be and
00:43:02.880 so right now we can draw the line in the
00:43:04.160 sand and be like do you want to keep
00:43:05.400 walking down the road that you have been
00:43:07.079 walking and if you don't then you have
00:43:09.760 to step into a new identity and with
00:43:11.640 that new identity comes new priorities
00:43:13.520 because people who want to be rich spend
00:43:15.160 money on themselves they spend money on
00:43:17.640 education they invest in their skill
00:43:19.680 sets because I want to align my identity
00:43:22.400 with the identity of those who came
00:43:23.720 before me who've done the things I want
00:43:25.400 to do right and just like those little
00:43:28.200 girls stepping into that identity we too
00:43:30.040 must step into the identity we want to
00:43:31.200 be does that make sense and so when
00:43:33.079 you're talking to somebody who's trying
00:43:34.359 to lose weight and they're like I can't
00:43:35.960 afford a gym membership and you're like
00:43:37.680 girl you're spending 200 bucks on your
00:43:40.079 nails and you've got a $1,000 outfit on
00:43:43.720 do you think another $1,000 outfit would
00:43:45.440 make you look better or your high school
00:43:49.240 weight
00:43:54.040 right do you think another ,000 outfit
00:43:56.400 would make you look better
00:43:57.559 or being rich as [ __ ] and I say that for
00:44:00.640 those of you who are thinking about on
00:44:01.680 the money side right like who waste like
00:44:05.640 some of you guys have bigger shoe
00:44:06.839 collections than like it's like Fitness
00:44:09.400 like Fitness people and shoes it's like
00:44:10.800 the weird like and Lululemon and the you
00:44:13.079 know spandex it's like a hundreds piece
00:44:14.960 of SP anyways so it's like your whole
00:44:17.480 wardrobe could be Consolidated into a
00:44:19.680 skill that could buy you as many
00:44:21.119 wardrobes as you want if you chose to
00:44:23.800 right okay rocket I don't like this
00:44:26.119 certain aspect this is one of my
00:44:27.960 favorite easiest ones to hit which is
00:44:30.520 like you got to change the change right
00:44:34.319 what you have been doing it's been
00:44:35.359 getting what you've been getting and you
00:44:37.240 got to change the change cuz like I
00:44:38.880 remember I would go through meal plans
00:44:40.119 with people and they'd be like well can
00:44:41.839 we change this because this is what I
00:44:42.800 eat for breakfast can we tell can we
00:44:44.480 make that the breakfast and I'm like
00:44:46.720 that breakfast makes you look like
00:44:52.960 you that way you spend your first four
00:44:55.160 hours of the day makes your bank account
00:44:56.640 looks like what it does look
00:44:58.280 like
00:45:00.040 ooh right right taking steps right we're
00:45:03.800 getting closer to the truth and so the
00:45:06.280 thing is is that it's going to hurt to
00:45:08.800 change because change hurts and you've
00:45:11.319 heard this one probably from Tony
00:45:12.319 Robinson if you haven't the question is
00:45:14.440 whether the pain of staying the same is
00:45:16.079 greater than the pain of change and
00:45:17.920 that's we just ask someone and this is
00:45:19.359 in the help part if someone's like the
00:45:22.200 pain of staying the same is not worse
00:45:23.559 than this Chang it's like then
00:45:24.800 girlfriend like gain 50 more pounds and
00:45:26.680 come back you know what I mean like get
00:45:28.520 there you I mean hit rock bottom this
00:45:30.520 isn't it for you I'm being
00:45:32.839 real some people Rock Bottom is 12% body
00:45:36.280 fat some people it's 500 lb but
00:45:39.400 everyone's got one you just got to know
00:45:41.520 where yours is and all you really got to
00:45:42.839 do is just move what rock bottom is for
00:45:44.359 you which is kind of interesting because
00:45:45.200 you start making a change here which is
00:45:47.119 kind of like interesting as a thought
00:45:49.599 but are you in enough pain is the
00:45:52.000 question you ask the person so for those
00:45:54.240 of you who are unwilling to make a
00:45:55.800 change because it feels contrary to like
00:45:57.800 I don't want to do I don't want to seem
00:45:59.000 salesy I don't want to I don't want to
00:46:00.640 help people like whatever right like is
00:46:03.720 your current situation more painful then
00:46:06.520 the change that you'll have to go
00:46:07.839 through or experience to get to where
00:46:09.200 you want to go and so the last one is
00:46:11.160 hypothetical I actually really love this
00:46:12.520 this is a great framework overall for
00:46:14.240 overcoming lots of different obstacles
00:46:16.000 um or objections that present themselves
00:46:17.960 but the hypothetical and there's lots of
00:46:19.079 ways of phrasing this which is like
00:46:20.079 you've probably heard the Unicorn
00:46:21.000 clothes you probably heard like if this
00:46:22.480 were perfect would you do it on want a
00:46:23.800 scare from 1 to 10 where would this
00:46:25.280 program be if 10 was amazing one was
00:46:27.359 terrible you know where is this they say
00:46:28.920 a number and you say cool what would
00:46:29.920 make it a 10 why isn't a one like you
00:46:32.000 guys heard this scripting before so you
00:46:33.760 guys are like no please talk slower um
00:46:36.920 the reason I said we have to learn the
00:46:38.160 principles behind it rather than
00:46:39.160 memorizing the script is that it all is
00:46:40.520 based on one thing which is hypothetical
00:46:42.280 which is if this were perfect would you
00:46:44.680 do it because you get a hypothetical
00:46:46.480 agreement and they say yes if it were
00:46:48.440 per the thing is that if you're like if
00:46:49.920 this were perfect would you do it if
00:46:51.240 someone says no then you're like girl
00:46:53.119 okay like let's take five steps back
00:46:56.520 this my breath
00:46:58.640 smell because the thing is they've
00:47:00.440 actually told you a lot there it's like
00:47:01.640 it has nothing to do with the stuff
00:47:02.880 you're talking about they don't trust
00:47:03.800 you and now we can talk about that right
00:47:06.440 so it's a great question to frame like
00:47:08.040 where are we and so it's like if this
00:47:09.480 were perfect would you do it sometimes
00:47:10.800 they'll laugh if you ever poor they'll
00:47:11.960 laugh they'll say yes right and so then
00:47:14.079 you get to flip it and say then what's
00:47:16.160 difference between Perfection and what
00:47:17.160 we've got and the thing is is that
00:47:18.200 people are very hard they don't actually
00:47:19.680 know how to generate making a program
00:47:22.599 cuz they're not going to like know all
00:47:23.599 the things you can deliver on the spot
00:47:26.000 right and and so they're like most of
00:47:28.480 the time they'll be like I don't know
00:47:30.839 you're like right well because it sounds
00:47:32.119 like it's nothing to do with the program
00:47:33.599 it's all about to do with you so let's
00:47:35.040 talk about that right and then all of a
00:47:36.920 sudden boom one step closer to the truth
00:47:39.680 does that make sense yeah all right and
00:47:42.920 that's why we do hypotheticals so if it
00:47:44.760 were perfect what's missing and then if
00:47:47.280 you can if it's if they do give you an
00:47:49.640 answer and they're like I just don't
00:47:51.240 want to do broccoli and you're like I do
00:47:54.160 green beans would you do it they're like
00:47:56.440 yeah you're like great green beans it is
00:47:58.760 sign here right
00:48:00.599 like some you would be [ __ ] amazed
00:48:03.160 how many times [ __ ] like that happens
00:48:04.520 it's like one crazy thing it's like well
00:48:05.960 if we didn't have that would you do it
00:48:06.960 like oh yeah
00:48:08.440 sure where were you 10 minutes ago right
00:48:11.520 and that's how you do hypothetical okay
00:48:13.000 we're making we're making progress you
00:48:14.440 still with me still digging okay
00:48:18.839 cool Authority all right this is one of
00:48:21.720 my favorite F and so this one instead of
00:48:25.119 having three I really just have like one
00:48:28.240 very good statement of reasoning that
00:48:30.160 you should understand okay this is real
00:48:32.359 [ __ ] so this is more of a process than
00:48:34.960 it is anything else but the spouse or
00:48:37.680 decision maker is not there right now
00:48:40.440 note for you guys a lot of you guys have
00:48:41.920 had the opportunity to go talk to a
00:48:43.000 spouse but a lot of you guys don't have
00:48:44.040 that in your business right like spouse
00:48:46.599 ain't there and they leave they're not
00:48:48.880 coming back right or they are but very
00:48:50.880 small percentage don't wait for it okay
00:48:53.000 so what we have to do is try and
00:48:55.000 sidestep it by isolating the objection
00:48:57.280 and casting aside the partner because
00:48:58.680 the partner is not there so how could
00:49:00.040 they object anything they don't even
00:49:01.079 [ __ ] know who you are right and so
00:49:03.119 the idea is and again this is assuming
00:49:05.400 if you have a really long-term thing
00:49:06.880 then you want the partner to be there
00:49:08.799 right like ideally that's what you have
00:49:10.000 but if you don't have the opportunity
00:49:11.079 then you got to go through the next step
00:49:12.119 all right which is what do you think
00:49:14.160 they wouldn't like and then they will
00:49:15.799 tell you and then you just overcome the
00:49:18.160 thing which has nothing to do with the
00:49:20.960 spouse because spouse isn't there right
00:49:24.200 very easy s side step does that make
00:49:25.640 sense this works really well
00:49:27.480 it's like why wouldn't they It's like
00:49:28.599 because they don't want me to fail o
00:49:30.400 they don't want you to
00:49:32.240 fail let's talk about you and so this is
00:49:35.400 the process that I walk
00:49:36.920 through do they approve of your current
00:49:39.040 struggle they happy that you're
00:49:40.920 struggling no okay then why would they
00:49:44.880 not approve of something that's going to
00:49:46.839 fix something they already don't approve
00:49:48.640 of right they're not happy with how
00:49:50.799 you're currently doing why would they be
00:49:51.839 against something that's already making
00:49:52.920 them
00:49:53.640 unhappy
00:49:55.319 right right
00:49:57.160 well let me ask you this and they pause
00:49:59.640 like if the rules were reversed and your
00:50:02.000 husband needed this to make what he
00:50:05.400 wants his dreams happen or your wife
00:50:07.799 needed this program to make her dreams
00:50:10.119 happen would you support
00:50:12.319 her then why wouldn't you support you
00:50:15.839 right right and I think the real problem
00:50:18.880 that we're dealing with here and this is
00:50:20.160 the kicker this for
00:50:21.880 everybody is that you're asking for
00:50:24.240 permission instead of support
00:50:27.280 because it is your life not theirs and
00:50:30.240 what happens is if you give that power
00:50:32.400 to them and then two years from now
00:50:34.960 you're still fat you're still poor
00:50:38.000 whatever it is who are you going to
00:50:40.200 blame them and so that's when you have a
00:50:43.440 resentful marriage because you didn't
00:50:45.200 own your [ __ ] and so I'm not saying you
00:50:48.119 shouldn't like explain the decision to
00:50:50.359 them but the way you explain it to them
00:50:52.440 is what I just said which is if I don't
00:50:54.440 do this for me I'm going to end up
00:50:56.799 resenting you and I don't want that and
00:51:00.040 instead of me bitching to you every day
00:51:01.359 about how we don't have money or about
00:51:02.440 how I don't like my body I'm now doing
00:51:04.839 this and I'm joining a group of support
00:51:06.720 of community of people just like me and
00:51:08.799 crazy enough for some reason doctors go
00:51:11.079 to college right right that makes sense
00:51:14.160 they go to medical school lawyers go to
00:51:15.680 law school but where do entrepreneurs go
00:51:17.960 there's no entrepreneur school no one
00:51:19.920 teaches the stuff but it turns out there
00:51:21.799 are people who teach it just for this
00:51:23.119 specific industry and I can take
00:51:24.799 failures of a thousand people in pack
00:51:26.720 into a
00:51:27.920 year and it's one10 the price of a
00:51:31.640 4-year
00:51:32.799 degree right and so instead of whining
00:51:35.040 to you what I commit to is I'm going to
00:51:36.799 show up and be a better husband a better
00:51:38.359 wife a better partner I'm not going to
00:51:39.799 [ __ ] to you about this the stuff
00:51:40.920 because I'm going to take this seriously
00:51:42.119 I'm going to go all and I'm not asking
00:51:43.559 your permission I'm just asking for your
00:51:45.280 support all right that's how you can
00:51:47.119 overcome it because I'm going be real
00:51:49.160 with you it is about them and you have
00:51:52.000 to believe that like you can't say this
00:51:54.079 unless you believe it because like you
00:51:55.839 will you save marriages by showing
00:51:59.599 people that they are the ones in control
00:52:01.640 because if they keep saying my husband's
00:52:03.240 not going to let me buy a weight loss
00:52:04.960 program what do you think she's secretly
00:52:06.640 saying can't believe you won't let me do
00:52:08.480 it right if that's real if she's using
00:52:11.160 it as a foil you sidestep you get
00:52:12.680 yourself right but that might be the
00:52:15.079 real thing and if that is the thing then
00:52:17.359 you have to let them step into that and
00:52:19.760 that's where you know having that's
00:52:21.839 where like having a three-day no sweat
00:52:23.720 guarantee or something like that is also
00:52:24.880 helpful it's like hey sign up and I use
00:52:27.680 I use a lot of aapor and humor in my
00:52:29.319 selling and so I'd be like hey Cindy if
00:52:32.599 you sign up and you tell your husband
00:52:35.599 and he's upset you have and and when he
00:52:38.400 sees you he's like girl I don't want you
00:52:40.280 to get in shape I want you to stay
00:52:41.920 overweight I want you to put those
00:52:43.200 sweatpants on I want you sit on that
00:52:44.760 couch reach your hand a bag of Cheetos
00:52:46.760 put the the Cheetos fingers on there I
00:52:49.280 want you to create generational unhealth
00:52:52.040 I want you to live 10 years less long I
00:52:53.960 want you to see our grandkids I don't
00:52:55.400 want that right I want to marry a
00:52:57.000 younger better you sooner because you're
00:52:58.880 going to have a heart attack if he says
00:53:00.359 that to you you have him call me and
00:53:02.079 then they're like cracking up and you're
00:53:03.040 like okay okay listen sign up three-day
00:53:05.640 no sweat like if he if he does tell you
00:53:08.160 that he just wants you to be out of
00:53:09.240 shape and never leave him because uh
00:53:11.480 because he doesn't want you to get you
00:53:12.480 hot cuz he's insecure if he says that um
00:53:15.240 yeah just let me know all right so like
00:53:17.200 the whole time you're just joking and
00:53:18.359 stuff but the 3day guarantee helps like
00:53:20.040 nudge a lot of these people over is that
00:53:21.599 cool you guys get that one
00:53:24.599 okay sweet
00:53:27.640 and so that goes for you right like it's
00:53:30.040 it's about support not permission that's
00:53:31.880 the bottom line right support not
00:53:33.839 permission because otherwise you're
00:53:35.160 going to blame them for your lack of
00:53:36.359 Dreams being realized rather than
00:53:38.040 blaming the person that should which is
00:53:39.319 you all right so this is avoidance now
00:53:41.720 we're getting to the core we've gotten
00:53:43.760 rid of time we know that you've got time
00:53:46.040 and the best time to do it is today
00:53:48.240 because you're going to be busy forever
00:53:51.079 right value we know that you can't
00:53:53.520 afford it if you can't afford it you'll
00:53:55.319 buy it if you can't afford it it's a
00:53:56.319 great great reason to do it and if the
00:53:57.680 value is there then there's no reason
00:53:59.559 not to do it because it'll pay for
00:54:00.599 itself right what's money good for
00:54:02.359 anyways you're going to pay for the
00:54:03.040 program regardless you want to pay him
00:54:04.599 less time or more time value is not a
00:54:06.920 problem fit you got to step into new
00:54:09.240 identity right you've got to be willing
00:54:12.119 to change and the question is just
00:54:14.280 whether the pain that you're
00:54:15.680 experiencing is less than the pain of
00:54:17.599 the change that it takes to experience
00:54:18.720 the next thing right if they step into
00:54:21.599 that they're good because it's not about
00:54:23.880 resources it's about resourcefulness so
00:54:26.359 the fit's not an issue Authority they
00:54:28.920 have to own it it's about support not
00:54:30.839 permission we all here do you feel like
00:54:33.000 we've peeled the layers back on your
00:54:34.680 prospects and they're just laid bare
00:54:36.680 naked there just you've solicited the
00:54:40.359 sale now you got to close all right
00:54:43.680 avoidance so now they're like wait wait
00:54:45.720 I need to think about
00:54:47.599 it so now that we've exhausted I'm
00:54:50.960 putting this as emphasis we've exhausted
00:54:53.480 all outside reasons now we are finally
00:54:56.440 talking to someone in power and that is
00:54:58.240 what a good coach does we don't make
00:54:59.799 decisions for people we help them make
00:55:01.720 decisions so here's I have to think
00:55:03.839 about it not sure give me a hand who's
00:55:06.359 dealt with somebody who say thinks that
00:55:07.760 way all right at least one person here
00:55:09.760 no I'm kidding all you guys that you
00:55:10.799 guys are great so this is how I divide
00:55:12.680 this up past present future and so
00:55:15.720 hopefully this should already before I I
00:55:17.200 dive into these give you simple
00:55:18.920 Frameworks to work through time you've
00:55:20.400 got macro micro when then right you've
00:55:22.760 got you got value you're thinking about
00:55:25.000 it's not a lot of money even if if it
00:55:26.440 were a lot of money it's not a lot of
00:55:27.440 money you're going to pay for it either
00:55:28.400 way like you have the simple Frameworks
00:55:29.960 that you can walk through you might just
00:55:30.920 hit them with one and if they hit it
00:55:31.960 with again you hit them with the other
00:55:33.119 angle because they're logical Frameworks
00:55:34.920 they're not scripts that's why I made
00:55:36.359 them bubbles you don't have to memorize
00:55:37.520 it just got to understand it
00:55:39.400 past so like I need to think about it
00:55:42.520 and so the thing is is and this the
00:55:43.839 first bubble there is if someone's like
00:55:45.200 I feel like this is happening so fast
00:55:46.559 any we get that one like I just I just
00:55:48.480 got on the phone with you I don't really
00:55:49.680 know who you are and you're like hey
00:55:51.599 this is not a fast decision right you've
00:55:53.079 been making this decision for the last 6
00:55:54.440 years you continually make the decision
00:55:56.319 we're doing to say is deciding you're
00:55:57.280 actually going to do something about it
00:55:59.240 right how long you wanted to lose weight
00:56:01.039 a long time so this is not a fast
00:56:03.280 decision at all but the thing is is that
00:56:06.160 and this is where you go sunk cost so if
00:56:08.599 I were talking to you guys I would say
00:56:10.720 you you know you bought tickets cuz you
00:56:12.480 saw some ad you registered there you got
00:56:15.599 your flights you got a hotel you blocked
00:56:17.960 the time you flew here you listen to
00:56:20.680 this whole thing you're 6 in from gold
00:56:23.760 this isn't a fast decision at all you
00:56:25.480 did all these to get here because it's
00:56:27.359 important to you so don't let that
00:56:29.280 Distortion stop you from getting what
00:56:31.520 you want right it's fear right let's
00:56:34.920 face that what are you afraid of having
00:56:36.680 happen which by the way I took the slide
00:56:38.880 out but my two favorite questions to ask
00:56:41.359 in a in a sale that I feel like are the
00:56:43.039 fastest to cut through is what are you
00:56:46.119 most afraid of having happen if you buy
00:56:48.720 what are you most afraid of what's the
00:56:50.599 worst thing that you envision in your
00:56:52.319 mind and if they're not sure I just fill
00:56:53.960 in the blanks I'm like I take your
00:56:54.960 credit card I swipe over as as much as I
00:56:56.720 possibly can I go to Vegas I put it all
00:56:58.680 on black and then I go to Monaco where
00:57:00.839 they can't extradite me fair enough and
00:57:02.480 they're like I was not thinking that and
00:57:03.720 you're like
00:57:04.680 right so what's the worst you know like
00:57:07.200 what's what's the real thing they're
00:57:09.160 like and then they're like you know I
00:57:10.880 just hav bought so many programs before
00:57:12.799 you're like right let's talk about that
00:57:15.520 right and so I'm going to skip one
00:57:17.440 forward and then I'm going to go back to
00:57:18.680 it this is one of my favorite obstacle
00:57:21.599 or objection overcomes it's I call it
00:57:24.200 don't let it burn you twice and this you
00:57:26.400 can see the date it happened yesterday
00:57:27.799 this girl texted me or me April 6th she
00:57:30.119 said it's crazy to think that I had a
00:57:31.720 sales call with you 6 years ago and I'm
00:57:33.280 kicking myself in the butt for not
00:57:34.480 jumping on this is yesterday right like
00:57:36.559 I don't even own the company anymore and
00:57:38.119 I said you let a bad decision burn you
00:57:39.599 twice once when you made your poor
00:57:41.119 investment but a second time when you
00:57:42.760 let that bad investment stop you from a
00:57:44.400 good investment it would be like anybody
00:57:46.760 ever have a boyfriend or girlfriend in
00:57:48.319 middle school or high school that
00:57:49.520 they're not currently married
00:57:51.000 to anyone just like just come on help me
00:57:54.799 out here okay
00:57:56.920 it would be like having a bad eighth
00:57:58.720 grade boyfriend or girlfriend and being
00:58:00.440 like you know what men aren't for
00:58:04.119 me all coaches suck right there's good
00:58:08.319 coaches there's bad coaches there's
00:58:09.640 crazy ass [ __ ] and there's crazy ass
00:58:11.160 dudes you know what I mean like there's
00:58:12.599 also good ones and so the things is if
00:58:14.559 you stop if you let the bad one prevent
00:58:16.559 you from the good one you get burned by
00:58:18.400 being with the bad one and because you
00:58:20.039 let the bad one control your next
00:58:21.720 decision right and so when someone has
00:58:24.520 had a bad experience with do doing keto
00:58:26.720 or whatever the [ __ ] right or you had a
00:58:28.839 bad experience with some program that
00:58:30.520 you did or did not do or they didn't
00:58:31.920 fulfill whatever either way don't let
00:58:34.839 that burn you twice because no matter
00:58:36.680 what you're going to have to do you're
00:58:37.480 going to have to do these actions
00:58:39.359 whether you're part of the program or
00:58:40.400 not you're got to do these workouts
00:58:42.319 where you're part of the program or not
00:58:43.559 doesn't matter you're going to have to
00:58:44.799 do it so you might as well do it but
00:58:46.559 somebody's going get you there faster
00:58:47.760 right let me go back one real quick so
00:58:50.680 it's not a fast decision and this is
00:58:52.880 another one that I love which is do you
00:58:55.079 think that you're maybe in this position
00:58:56.880 because you have struggled to make a
00:58:57.960 decision in the past you have waffled
00:58:59.760 when it came time to make to make the
00:59:01.280 hard call have you been in this
00:59:02.839 conversation and said no before yeah do
00:59:06.119 you think that's why you're here yeah do
00:59:08.799 you think that might be the reason you
00:59:09.799 should change
00:59:10.880 that yeah okay let's change it one
00:59:14.599 decision change your life and the last
00:59:16.599 one is like are you tired of another
00:59:18.640 year of almost right tired another year
00:59:21.079 of almost hitting your goals of almost
00:59:23.079 getting to 10K a month of of almost you
00:59:25.680 know Hing the team that you wanted of
00:59:27.280 almost retiring your your wife or
00:59:28.839 husband or almost moving into the
00:59:30.000 neighborhood that you wanted to move
00:59:30.920 into or almost being able to pay for
00:59:32.359 your kids Recreational Sports rather
00:59:33.720 than not being able to because you can't
00:59:34.680 afford it you're tired of another year
00:59:36.400 of almost well if you're tired of
00:59:38.280 another year almost then we can't do
00:59:39.160 what we're doing to get here for another
00:59:40.839 year because we're going to get another
00:59:42.319 year almost and so the question isn't
00:59:44.599 what it cost you but how much has it
00:59:46.559 cost you to not decide up to this point
00:59:49.760 right the cost of
00:59:51.880 inaction and I think that when we think
00:59:53.640 about our lives in Reverse we never
00:59:56.039 never regret the things that we did we
00:59:57.319 regret the things we didn't do the
00:59:59.280 opportunities that we let pass by and I
01:00:01.640 think that if you can let that person
01:00:02.680 step into that power they will make the
01:00:04.319 decision to help themselves like this
01:00:06.039 person did not all right present so
01:00:10.680 depends on who you're talking to
01:00:11.559 someone's talking about past stuff then
01:00:12.640 you do with the past stuff the second
01:00:14.520 frame for avoidance is present which is
01:00:16.400 they just don't know how to make a
01:00:17.240 [ __ ] decision right and so you have
01:00:19.240 to help them make a decision and so this
01:00:21.039 one the rocking chair is one that I just
01:00:23.280 for some reason have used a tremendous
01:00:24.640 amount of time especially when I was
01:00:25.480 selling weight loss
01:00:26.520 is to be like I just really really need
01:00:28.359 to think about it like totally
01:00:30.440 understand well let's walk through like
01:00:32.359 what that looks like you're not going to
01:00:33.359 like go home sit in the rocking chair
01:00:35.240 you know smoke a cigarette because of
01:00:36.640 course you're not healthy yet right
01:00:37.839 you'll quit when you're healthy right
01:00:39.520 you're smoking your cigarette and you're
01:00:40.680 like H am I going to do this weight loss
01:00:42.480 program right you're just sit there and
01:00:43.720 stare into the clouds like I wonder no
01:00:45.720 of course now you're get in your car and
01:00:46.799 you're going to realize you got to pick
01:00:47.599 up Timmy from soccer practice you got to
01:00:48.799 get groceries you got to cook you got to
01:00:50.079 clean you got to pick you know go do the
01:00:51.319 laundry got to do all these things right
01:00:53.440 and then 3 four 5 days from now you're
01:00:55.319 going to put on that pair of jeans and
01:00:56.599 it's not going to fit you be like
01:00:58.760 [ __ ] and just there you'll have made the
01:01:01.839 decision you'll keep living your
01:01:03.799 life and so let's just make it now
01:01:06.400 because the reality is that it doesn't
01:01:07.599 take information to make decisions sorry
01:01:09.799 it doesn't take time to make decisions
01:01:11.240 takes information and I'm the only
01:01:13.400 source of information you got so let's
01:01:15.960 talk I'm here I'm here for you let's do
01:01:18.480 it right because that's the fallacy is
01:01:20.799 that people think they need more time to
01:01:23.160 make decisions because they assume they
01:01:24.839 will get more information in that time
01:01:27.119 but if you are the source of the
01:01:29.119 information then time does not help them
01:01:32.039 and so let's confront it now and let me
01:01:33.480 answer the questions you have to make
01:01:34.799 the decision one way or another does
01:01:36.720 that make sense yeah all right and so
01:01:40.000 then they're like well then [ __ ] how do
01:01:41.160 I make a decision you're like glad you
01:01:42.440 asked so there's three things that we
01:01:44.280 got to understand do you believe that
01:01:46.640 this product or service is going to help
01:01:48.079 you achieve what you want yes or no
01:01:50.880 they're going to say yes right and if
01:01:52.880 they don't you can confront it note all
01:01:54.839 of these are confronting decisions so
01:01:57.520 we've moved all the way down the onion
01:01:59.279 right we're at truth now and all like
01:02:01.599 the theme of the of the last bullet is
01:02:04.559 confrontation we have to confront the
01:02:06.520 decision we got to peel it back and be
01:02:08.440 like are we going to do this or not
01:02:10.240 right because we already got out the
01:02:11.359 time we got out the fit we got out the
01:02:12.839 SP we got everything out of the way it's
01:02:14.480 just you do you think that this is going
01:02:16.680 to help you get closer to your goals yes
01:02:18.680 or no two do you trust me to fill to
01:02:21.960 fulfill my word that I said I'm going to
01:02:23.440 help you I'm going to do these calls I'm
01:02:24.520 going to do these workouts I'm going to
01:02:25.440 do whatever right three this is the mo
01:02:28.000 probably the most important one do you
01:02:29.880 think it'll work for you and if they say
01:02:31.839 no you say why not and then they have to
01:02:34.279 defend why not and then it's very easy
01:02:36.960 at that point it's a 6inch putt right
01:02:39.359 and once they say yes to all three which
01:02:40.680 is usually what'll happen be like cool
01:02:41.920 we'll make the decision together do you
01:02:42.839 know how to make the decision they'll
01:02:43.960 say no you go through the three and the
01:02:46.000 last question is they said yes yes yes
01:02:47.440 it's just do you have or have access to
01:02:50.200 the amount of money to get started do
01:02:52.279 you have the MX do you want me to help
01:02:53.799 you enroll in an MX cuz I want to I want
01:02:55.599 to help you I'm good either way but if
01:02:58.599 you believe that this is going to help
01:02:59.720 you get closer you believe that what I'm
01:03:01.279 saying is true and you believe that you
01:03:02.720 can be successful it's my moral
01:03:04.319 obligation to get you going and do
01:03:05.480 everything in my power to help you get
01:03:06.880 the money or get access to it because
01:03:08.599 the real R is if I was giving you a
01:03:09.760 Ferrari right now for $5,000 you'd find
01:03:11.680 the money if your landlord needed you to
01:03:13.480 come up with $10,000 because you had
01:03:14.760 background and payroll you'd find the
01:03:16.359 money so find the money let's do it
01:03:19.079 right
01:03:20.640 three who wants to make informed
01:03:22.799 decisions yes
01:03:26.920 how can you make an informed decision if
01:03:29.079 you haven't even tried it huh so this is
01:03:31.960 when you have some element of trial in
01:03:34.240 the program or some sort of guarantee
01:03:36.039 which is why I'm a big fan of guarantees
01:03:38.240 it's like well you can't make the
01:03:40.119 decision to buy that's informed until
01:03:42.680 you're on the inside so I'm not even
01:03:44.319 asking you to make a decision right now
01:03:46.119 I'm just asking you make an informed
01:03:47.200 decision which you can only do on the
01:03:48.799 inside and if after 30 days I'm not what
01:03:50.880 I said this product doesn't do what I
01:03:52.440 told you I didn't fulfill my promise and
01:03:53.880 you don't think it's going to work for
01:03:54.839 you you let me I'll give you the money
01:03:56.680 back low pressure you get someone to
01:03:59.119 decide by not
01:04:00.400 deciding even easier does that make
01:04:02.640 sense think that'll help you close yeah
01:04:06.200 all right and then uh this one is it
01:04:09.640 depends on who you're selling to but
01:04:10.720 sometimes if you a logical person it's
01:04:12.160 like do you know what deciding even
01:04:13.839 means like where the atmology of the
01:04:15.799 work comes from it's dcad which is Latin
01:04:18.520 which means to cut off to kill off and
01:04:21.160 so the question is which future are we
01:04:23.720 killing off today
01:04:26.039 are we killing off the future of the
01:04:28.319 dreams that you want are we killing off
01:04:30.640 the future sorry are we killing off the
01:04:33.680 future of of not doing anything and the
01:04:37.720 life that you've lived up to this point
01:04:39.880 because indecision is a decision
01:04:41.680 inaction is an active decision right and
01:04:44.240 so it's just which one are we killing
01:04:45.279 today we killing your dreams or we
01:04:46.480 killing your past second and last one
01:04:49.760 future so we talked about past so if
01:04:52.200 they're thinking about the past the
01:04:53.160 things that hurt them don't let it burn
01:04:54.200 you twice Etc right they don't know how
01:04:56.319 to make a decision rocking chair this is
01:04:58.240 how you make a decision three things you
01:04:59.599 have access to money great let's get
01:05:01.079 going you want to kill your past you
01:05:02.000 want to kill your future right awesome
01:05:04.000 we're talking about the future this is
01:05:05.400 actually magnifying pain which
01:05:08.119 is cool you got here it's been 5 years
01:05:10.599 you've been struggling how's another
01:05:12.559 five years sound what if we just keep
01:05:14.960 doing let's go with indecision let's
01:05:16.480 look at it what does five years of you
01:05:18.279 doing what you've been doing look like
01:05:20.440 and is that a place you want to be no
01:05:23.440 you got to change the change let's do it
01:05:25.440 right
01:05:26.720 and then you go right into let's
01:05:27.760 consider the options which is
01:05:30.400 like like this is logic right so let's
01:05:33.160 consider the
01:05:34.599 options option one you do the thing get
01:05:38.200 the result life is awesome option two
01:05:42.400 you don't do the thing you don't get the
01:05:44.240 result because you didn't do the thing
01:05:45.760 option three you do the thing but then
01:05:47.079 you don't get the result all these are
01:05:49.000 the options I can happen in front of you
01:05:51.279 because we have a guarantee they're all
01:05:53.520 risk-free except for one of them only
01:05:56.079 one of them has a true guarantee of not
01:05:57.480 getting you where you want which is
01:05:58.760 walking out the door so which risk-free
01:06:00.880 option do you want the one that's
01:06:01.760 risk-free that guarantees that you're
01:06:03.480 not going to get there or the one that's
01:06:04.839 risk-free and has the potential to get
01:06:06.200 you where you want to
01:06:08.000 go right that's not an emotional close
01:06:11.359 it's logic and if you have an offer
01:06:13.079 that's set up that way you should be
01:06:14.319 able to close most people as long as
01:06:15.640 they don't think you're an [ __ ] right
01:06:18.480 okay this is one that's more around
01:06:20.559 urgency because again this is avoidance
01:06:23.000 if someone says I I'm still not sure I
01:06:25.880 want to think about it more whatever you
01:06:27.440 say well you're not going to struggle
01:06:28.760 forever right like you don't want to
01:06:30.640 struggle forever you're going to do
01:06:32.000 something about this whether it's weight
01:06:33.279 loss business whatever they're going to
01:06:34.839 say yes you're like well if you're going
01:06:36.920 to fix your business eventually you
01:06:39.720 might as well start fixing it now so you
01:06:42.200 can start enjoying the fruits of that
01:06:43.319 labor sooner would you prefer making
01:06:45.599 more money faster or slower what's your
01:06:48.079 preference great so if you're going to
01:06:49.319 do it eventually you might as well do it
01:06:50.599 now does that make sense it's a little
01:06:53.240 nudge this is a final one that I just
01:06:55.240 really like from a framing perspective
01:06:56.720 which is instead of a like this has to
01:06:59.880 be my savior this program has to get me
01:07:02.880 to an ifbb Pro bikini body and I'm 100
01:07:05.680 pounds overweight probably not realistic
01:07:09.119 right reframe the question is do you
01:07:12.920 think that making the decision is going
01:07:14.160 to be help you get closer or further
01:07:16.520 from your goal that's it because if we
01:07:19.039 keep making decisions that keep getting
01:07:20.279 us closer we will get there eventually
01:07:22.440 but if we make decisions that get us
01:07:23.680 further away we will not get there and
01:07:25.640 so do you think that this is going to
01:07:26.680 get you closer to your goal than what
01:07:28.039 you're currently doing yes what are we
01:07:30.359 waiting for we don't need to be snipers
01:07:32.039 we need to be directionally right we do
01:07:34.079 that long enough we'll get there does
01:07:35.440 that make sense that helps you too
01:07:37.720 because we have this fear of
01:07:39.039 perfectionism is this going to be the
01:07:40.680 one probably not but it will get you
01:07:43.599 [ __ ] way closer right because I can
01:07:45.880 tell you there's no one program that
01:07:47.160 changed my life but the the decision to
01:07:50.039 buy education changed my life forever
01:07:53.200 does that make sense yeah all right boom
01:07:56.720 and so let me let me look at the top we
01:07:58.559 have no reasons left not to own the
01:08:01.039 power that you have it's just you all
01:08:04.640 right and here's bonus number six and
01:08:06.880 you can use this as one of like there's
01:08:09.480 some closes that you use all the time
01:08:10.720 you always go back to right the reason
01:08:13.279 you are telling yourself not to do this
01:08:14.599 is the reason you to do
01:08:16.198 it how long do you want I can't afford
01:08:18.560 this to be on your list of problems in
01:08:20.080 life the fact that you don't have time
01:08:22.120 is the very reason you need to do this
01:08:24.799 the fact that you're so dependent on
01:08:25.839 your spouse is the reason you need to
01:08:26.960 take this decision and own it right the
01:08:30.359 fact that you're not sure about the
01:08:31.319 person that you want to be is the very
01:08:32.359 reason that we're going to help you get
01:08:33.279 it in this program so whatever the
01:08:35.000 reason is is usually the biggest chain
01:08:37.319 that you're holding on to is the thing
01:08:38.439 that you're enslaving yourself to is the
01:08:40.080 thing that you're casting your power to
01:08:42.359 if you break that chain power comes back
01:08:44.319 to you and so the very reason that
01:08:46.198 you're holding yourself back is
01:08:47.479 typically the very reason that you need
01:08:49.000 to do it so hopefully this helps you
01:08:51.279 realize that you and your clients are
01:08:52.560 always in complete power did I
01:08:54.158 accomplish that
01:08:57.520 awesome thank
01:09:03.080 you and like I promised at the beginning
01:09:05.158 My Hope Is that you become more powerful
01:09:06.399 by making decisions rather than letting
01:09:08.120 life make them for you all right so
01:09:09.880 here's a few final
01:09:11.120 thoughts fortunes are created by taking
01:09:14.040 a lot of risk with a little bit of money
01:09:16.960 fortunes are maintained by taking a
01:09:18.560 little bit of risk with a lot of money
01:09:21.319 and every one of those people that was
01:09:22.640 self-made takes a lot of risk with a
01:09:24.880 little bit of money and sometimes you
01:09:26.399 need to take that step because it's the
01:09:27.640 only way to build the fortune all right
01:09:30.920 and if everything that I've ever made in
01:09:32.319 my life all right sorry everything that
01:09:34.238 I've made in my life is a result of
01:09:36.158 investing in my own education it has
01:09:38.479 gotten me far higher returns than any
01:09:40.520 stock any real estate any crypto right
01:09:43.399 any whatever buy a mile and people say
01:09:46.719 like it's all about investing yourself
01:09:48.120 like I just I think it sounds a morphus
01:09:50.120 it's like Buy experience and
01:09:52.839 skills because no government can take
01:09:55.640 that from you no divorce can take that
01:09:57.760 from you nothing can take that from you
01:10:00.120 and I come from a family where so we're
01:10:02.920 Persian and so my my parents had to flee
01:10:06.560 Iran During the Revolution and so they
01:10:10.719 had land and houses and other stuff
01:10:14.280 right and my uncle was uh the brother to
01:10:19.080 a guy who started the lottery in Iran he
01:10:21.679 owned the lottery because you can do
01:10:23.080 that there right very rich rich and so
01:10:27.040 my dad and him he went to London my dad
01:10:28.880 went to the
01:10:29.840 US he had no
01:10:32.080 skills and he was able to just forge
01:10:34.320 enough money to buy a print shop and he
01:10:36.040 lives above the print shop in London and
01:10:37.920 still to this day that's what he does
01:10:40.480 and went to visit him it was incredibly
01:10:43.159 sad seeing just like well once once
01:10:45.560 incred and his wife my dad gave her a
01:10:47.840 scarf and it was like a nice scarf
01:10:49.120 apparently and she just baled she's like
01:10:51.040 I used to have rooms of these and now I
01:10:52.520 have nothing and blah blah blah blah
01:10:53.840 right my dad came to the United States
01:10:55.880 with
01:10:56.800 $1,000 but because he had skills he
01:10:59.520 built it all from scratch and so I mean
01:11:02.280 he was a doctor as all Middle Eastern
01:11:04.360 and Indians are
01:11:06.280 um right doctor lawyer accountant
01:11:09.560 engineer anyways um the only four
01:11:11.760 approved
01:11:12.760 paths but when we say invest in that we
01:11:15.800 come from a place where like it was
01:11:17.400 literally all taken the government was
01:11:19.480 like that's our house now that's our
01:11:22.400 land now that bank account is our bank
01:11:24.840 account now
01:11:26.239 and so that was why it was so and like
01:11:27.960 that might be a benefit for me I had
01:11:29.880 somebody who was always like it's the
01:11:30.880 only thing no one can take from you and
01:11:33.120 so why would you not invest in the one
01:11:35.159 thing that can never be stolen can never
01:11:36.640 be taken and compounds with time and it
01:11:39.440 increases your capacity to make money
01:11:42.360 increases your capacity to
01:11:44.679 live and so I like to think of the
01:11:47.040 Investments that I've made in myself as
01:11:48.280 bricks on a bridge and so if I'm on the
01:11:50.719 bottom left here and where I want to be
01:11:53.000 is the top right is right looking like
01:11:55.480 The Nightmare Before Christmas now
01:11:58.000 um you're going like there are many
01:12:01.040 skills that it takes to cross the bridge
01:12:03.400 right and just like you have an
01:12:05.360 arithmetic teacher in high school once
01:12:06.880 you learn calculus you're not like that
01:12:08.440 guy was a load of [ __ ] calculus is what
01:12:10.560 no you have to learn things in sequence
01:12:12.840 right and so the thing is is that when
01:12:14.679 we build this bridge it's one brick at a
01:12:16.159 time and I always come back to the same
01:12:18.159 question which is is this going to get
01:12:19.760 me closer to where I want to go I don't
01:12:22.560 need it to get me there I just need to
01:12:24.560 get closer and if I get better I'll get
01:12:26.840 there eventually right as long as I
01:12:28.719 don't stop moving and so that's why
01:12:30.920 that's that what I've dedicated my life
01:12:32.000 to education my mission is to document
01:12:34.159 and share the best practice building
01:12:35.239 world class
01:12:36.360 companies because when you realize that
01:12:38.280 you are the source you realize that
01:12:40.440 Superman is not coming it's just you and
01:12:44.320 every decision that you make is a vote
01:12:45.760 towards or against the person that we
01:12:47.239 want to be and so the question for you
01:12:50.000 is that are your decisions voting
01:12:51.400 towards the person that you want to
01:12:52.719 become or just more of what you already
01:12:54.679 have
01:12:56.520 and so people ask me all the time how do
01:12:57.960 you move so quickly and the answer is I
01:13:00.120 know how to buy time and the follow
01:13:02.280 question is how do you buy time you buy
01:13:04.000 Time by buying the time took other
01:13:05.719 people to make mistakes that taught them
01:13:07.320 the lessons that's how you do it right
01:13:09.320 that's that's the heck and so right now
01:13:12.080 the ignorance of not knowing how to
01:13:13.480 create a million dollars a year is
01:13:15.639 costing you a million dollars a year the
01:13:17.560 fact that you don't know how to make a
01:13:18.560 million dollar a year is costing you a
01:13:19.880 million dollars a year think about it
01:13:22.120 right and so therefore you should always
01:13:24.320 be willing to invest money to increase
01:13:25.840 the capacity for your income because
01:13:28.520 once you have it that capacity pays you
01:13:31.320 forever you're increasing your ability
01:13:34.000 does that make sense we're widening the
01:13:36.239 pipe and so when I thought about this I
01:13:38.880 just added zeros to it and I was like
01:13:40.120 it's [ __ ] costing me a billion
01:13:41.520 dollars a year not knowing how to make a
01:13:42.760 billion dollars God right but it's true
01:13:46.880 because the thing the number one tax
01:13:49.120 that no one appreciates or no one
01:13:51.320 respects is not the tax of the
01:13:53.360 government it's not capital gains not
01:13:55.360 income tax it's the time tax of
01:13:58.360 ignorance someone asked Lela yesterday
01:14:01.080 what's the number one thing that people
01:14:02.480 from 0 to 10K are messing up you don't
01:14:06.040 know what the [ __ ] you're doing that's
01:14:08.159 what's messing you up you're ignorant
01:14:09.760 you have no idea you're eating an orange
01:14:11.159 like an apple no clue
01:14:13.159 right and it's not because you don't
01:14:15.159 have the processing power it's not
01:14:17.159 because you don't have the ability to
01:14:18.400 reason it's because you just don't know
01:14:21.360 and so the goal is to pay down the time
01:14:24.159 tax of ignorance fast as humanly
01:14:26.080 possible and the only way you do that is
01:14:28.120 by educating and investing yourself
01:14:30.400 right specifically investing in
01:14:32.880 experiences that build skills so make
01:14:36.080 the decisions that to help yourself
01:14:38.280 Implement like crazy take ownership
01:14:40.480 because we just discover that all the
01:14:41.960 other [ __ ] is not real is literally a
01:14:44.800 distortion of reality that anything that
01:14:46.800 you give your power to that's not you is
01:14:49.480 fake you're making it a false god in
01:14:51.719 your life and your prospects are too and
01:14:53.760 you now you know how to confront those
01:14:55.800 when your mind tries to play tricks on
01:14:57.239 you and realize that there are no silver
01:14:59.760 bullets no program is going to save your
01:15:01.960 life all right but some things can move
01:15:04.520 you close to your goals and when those
01:15:06.719 rare opportunities present themselves
01:15:09.440 take them all right because either you
01:15:11.960 win or you learn and both of those get
01:15:14.639 you closer to wherever you want to go
01:15:16.440 all right and so a wrap up with this 10
01:15:21.000 years ago I had to that was me a Swanky
01:15:26.159 uh you know when I was a consultant
01:15:27.760 looking cool was actually after I don't
01:15:29.800 even have a good picture when I was a
01:15:30.840 consultant but there's me in a suit
01:15:33.840 um and I I knew I hated the job that I
01:15:37.639 had um I made okay money but I just like
01:15:40.480 I just really wasn't happy um and I
01:15:44.560 emailed 40 gym owners and I was like hey
01:15:46.280 I think I want to get in Fitness can
01:15:48.120 somebody like help me out one guy was
01:15:50.560 like sure you can work for free I was
01:15:52.040 like awesome uh that guy was standing
01:15:53.760 back to y and anybody know who Sam backr
01:15:56.760 is raise hand jeez okay well seven
01:16:00.480 figure Sam is what he used to be known
01:16:02.239 as he actually died during Co um which
01:16:04.560 is really sad for me because I really
01:16:05.639 looked up to Sam and the thing is is
01:16:08.280 that when I got to his office I
01:16:11.080 literally drove across the country from
01:16:12.440 Baltimore to LA or Chino Hills which is
01:16:15.239 where he was and I showed up without
01:16:17.159 notice and he was like you're a
01:16:18.360 psychopath I just met you from the
01:16:19.400 internet and I was like I'm here I'm
01:16:20.639 ready to learn he was like I'm going to
01:16:23.080 lunch and um
01:16:25.560 but right after he came back from lunch
01:16:27.600 uh he was like all right so you should
01:16:29.719 join my my Mastermind and I was like I
01:16:31.719 don't have a gym he's like that's okay
01:16:34.560 it was a gym Mastermind
01:16:37.440 um and I didn't I mean like I was 22
01:16:40.760 like I did not have a lot of money um
01:16:43.520 and he was like well it's 10 grand and I
01:16:46.600 was like I I don't know and he's like
01:16:50.080 you need a [ __ ] commit man he's like
01:16:51.600 you've been waffling back and forth I
01:16:53.400 had had multiple phone calls with him
01:16:54.639 before left um he's like I think you
01:16:57.159 need to draw a line in the sand and
01:16:59.440 thank you God you know thank God he did
01:17:01.480 cuz I did take a step over I had no idea
01:17:04.280 what the [ __ ] I was doing but I was
01:17:05.920 trying to start paying down the time tax
01:17:07.320 of ignorance and I got around a whole
01:17:09.080 bunch of other Fitness professionals and
01:17:10.960 I learned way more from all of them than
01:17:14.080 I ever learned from Sam but because of
01:17:16.440 that my belief started to change the
01:17:18.120 ways I saw the world Chang the traits I
01:17:20.040 started to embody change and started
01:17:21.760 taking steps The Mastermind I got from
01:17:23.679 Sam is not what made me $100 million but
01:17:26.400 it got me on the right path towards
01:17:27.800 making it over the years of having
01:17:29.159 hundreds of salespeople work for me I've
01:17:31.000 seen these nine things that the best
01:17:33.480 sales people do differently than
01:17:34.880 everyone else and so if you boil it down
01:17:37.040 a salesperson has three jobs to do they
01:17:39.440 have to maximize the number of
01:17:40.880 opportunities they have they have to
01:17:42.360 convert the highest percentage of those
01:17:43.920 opportunities and and this is the
01:17:45.360 important part they have to do it
01:17:46.719 consistently for a very long period of
01:17:48.199 time and so the nine things they do
01:17:49.760 differently will fall elegantly into
01:17:51.400 each of these three buckets let's start
01:17:53.159 with the first one which is maximizing
01:17:54.600 lead needs or maximize the number of
01:17:55.960 opportunities that a salesman
01:17:59.040 has so right off the top I've never seen
01:18:01.840 a salesperson who does the most in a
01:18:04.040 company have the lowest amount of hours
01:18:06.600 worked I've yet to have it you know what
01:18:08.000 maybe there's a special snowflake out
01:18:09.400 there but every company that I've owned
01:18:11.280 and every company that I've looked at
01:18:13.280 the guy who works the most hours is the
01:18:15.840 one who sells the most deals and so
01:18:18.480 maximizing opportunities comes in a
01:18:20.080 number of different forms so number one
01:18:21.800 is that they have the total most hours
01:18:24.000 available per day because you should be
01:18:26.360 available when the prospect is available
01:18:28.400 and that means sometimes working long
01:18:29.719 hours it sometimes mean working weekends
01:18:31.440 and yes businesses also pay rent on
01:18:33.480 Sundays and so you can make sales on
01:18:34.960 Sundays so my software company Allen
01:18:37.280 scheduled 4,000 plus appointments per
01:18:39.440 day across a number of different
01:18:40.760 Industries and so we got to see all the
01:18:42.560 way from click to close which companies
01:18:44.480 were selling the most people and we
01:18:46.239 looked at all the different data so
01:18:48.320 times of day number of days per week you
01:18:50.800 know speed between text responses number
01:18:53.199 of characters and text response all
01:18:54.880 these different variables CU I had two
01:18:56.120 data analysts that looked at this to
01:18:57.679 figure out how could he maximize
01:18:59.040 throughput for any business and
01:19:00.440 obviously sales a big component of that
01:19:02.400 and the single greatest lever on
01:19:04.840 throughput across all companies was the
01:19:07.960 number of total available time slots
01:19:10.800 which means availability was the
01:19:12.920 strongest predictor of total sales and
01:19:16.159 let me give you a tactical example of
01:19:17.560 this when Leila and I were traveling the
01:19:19.800 other day we went to a different city
01:19:21.719 and she wanted to get her nails done or
01:19:23.080 something and so she she just pulled up
01:19:25.280 Yelp and looked at the one that had the
01:19:26.880 top reviews called them up and they said
01:19:28.520 oh I'm sorry we don't do same day
01:19:30.120 appointments and they're like we can
01:19:31.560 book you in for 2 days from now and she
01:19:33.000 was like yep don't care called the next
01:19:34.679 one same thing called the third one and
01:19:37.040 then they were like yeah we can take you
01:19:38.360 right now and boom she went in and the
01:19:40.320 thing is is that both those other
01:19:41.639 business owners the first two business
01:19:42.920 owners that said no lost money and the
01:19:45.360 next time she comes to that place she'll
01:19:46.960 probably go back to the one that she
01:19:47.960 went to as long as they did a good job
01:19:49.600 and so trying to be egotistical about it
01:19:52.159 rather than accommodate customers it's
01:19:53.760 like well we're so
01:19:55.239 great you just lose money now if we
01:19:58.760 maximize the total number of time that's
01:20:00.520 available for the salesperson to sell
01:20:02.400 then the next part of maximizing their
01:20:04.159 opportunities is getting as much of
01:20:05.880 their day as humanly possible filled
01:20:07.920 with the best opportunities and so the
01:20:10.920 second subunit of this
01:20:13.880 is they will pull up calls and so the
01:20:16.560 first thing is if you see a call that
01:20:17.960 gets booked or you book a call that's on
01:20:19.800 Thursday and today's Monday if you have
01:20:21.520 a time slot that's open you grab your
01:20:23.679 Thursday appointment you drag it into
01:20:25.320 today because today appointments always
01:20:27.120 have higher show up rates and if you
01:20:28.679 pull it up then they're even more
01:20:30.560 interested and you can close even higher
01:20:32.199 and you can have two or three calls by
01:20:33.960 that same Thursday time so you increase
01:20:35.360 your sales velocity now a correlator to
01:20:37.360 that is if you look at your calendar and
01:20:39.280 you've reached out to a prospect and
01:20:41.080 that person has not responded back and
01:20:42.679 now it's the same day and they're coming
01:20:43.920 up in a few hours well what do you do
01:20:46.440 well the best salespeople pull that time
01:20:49.159 slot and say hey sorry I didn't see that
01:20:50.840 you confirmed why don't we do the same
01:20:52.360 thing for tomorrow you can push it out
01:20:53.679 one and then try and fill that time slot
01:20:55.719 with somebody who is responsive even if
01:20:57.679 they're later in the week and that
01:20:59.239 increases your total number of calls per
01:21:01.719 day and so fundamentally the perfect day
01:21:03.800 for a salesperson is that they have call
01:21:05.679 back to back to back to back to back
01:21:07.440 with the best possible leads that are
01:21:08.840 the hottest that day I learned that
01:21:11.040 little tactic about pulling up because
01:21:12.600 we had one of our companies uh was in
01:21:14.400 solar sales and they had one rep that
01:21:17.040 massively outperformed everyone else and
01:21:18.679 I was like what is this guy doing and so
01:21:20.760 what he was doing was he would whenever
01:21:22.600 a new appointment would book he would
01:21:24.239 immediately called the appointment to
01:21:25.880 qualify the lead cuz that checks two
01:21:27.679 boxes one is he says okay is this person
01:21:29.320 qualified to buy if the person was he
01:21:31.520 had two decision paths if they had the
01:21:33.040 time right then he would just go
01:21:34.440 straight into closing because he was in
01:21:36.199 offthe call sop and then by getting in
01:21:38.560 contact with the lead became on the call
01:21:40.639 in terms of his sop and if they said
01:21:42.320 they had time right now he just went for
01:21:43.719 the sale that maximizes his time on call
01:21:46.360 if they said no then the reason for his
01:21:48.360 call was that he had an opening later
01:21:50.000 that day that he was trying to fill up
01:21:51.800 and so he either takes the moment now
01:21:53.199 that he's working the lead and turns it
01:21:54.360 into into a sales call or he fills
01:21:56.120 another slot later in the day and turns
01:21:57.920 that into a sales call both of those
01:21:59.639 things maximize the number of sales that
01:22:01.360 guy was having and this guy was selling
01:22:02.719 like four times more units than the
01:22:04.800 second best guy on the team and then
01:22:06.480 they obviously saw this and then adopted
01:22:08.080 it companywide and then of course I saw
01:22:09.719 it and adopted it across all my entire
01:22:11.000 portfolio and let me double down to why
01:22:13.080 that's so powerful because not only does
01:22:15.480 the salesman have two opportunities to
01:22:16.840 sell now or later that day he also opens
01:22:19.480 up the slot later in the week for
01:22:21.199 availability for another customer that
01:22:23.320 can't make it today to to book that time
01:22:25.520 then because what I have found and we
01:22:27.199 saw this with the software was if you
01:22:28.880 have fewer time slots people may still
01:22:30.920 book with you but they are not booking
01:22:32.719 at the most convenient time for them
01:22:34.719 you'll see schedule rates but then show
01:22:36.400 rates will drop because it's not the
01:22:37.960 time that works for them ideally and so
01:22:40.480 you want to make it the most
01:22:42.000 accommodating so it's not just are is it
01:22:43.560 convenient or inconvenient it's how
01:22:44.840 convenient is it if I have a a tight
01:22:47.080 deadline and a hard stop and I've got
01:22:48.719 something that I'm stressed about
01:22:49.639 afterwards I might be able to schedule a
01:22:51.600 call then but I might not be in a in the
01:22:53.719 mood to buy high but if I say you know
01:22:55.880 what Sunday afternoon I'm free I'll have
01:22:57.239 all the time in my world I'm going to
01:22:58.440 have zero urgency to get off the call
01:23:00.880 I'll listen to you and I'll be in a
01:23:02.000 completely different Zone and that might
01:23:03.480 be when I'm in receiving hands in terms
01:23:05.400 of prospect brain mode for
01:23:09.159 buying and so one of the things that the
01:23:11.960 best sales people have and this is
01:23:13.239 something that companies should provide
01:23:14.920 but often don't is that you have two
01:23:16.920 Sops meaning standard operating
01:23:18.280 procedures you have an on thee call sop
01:23:20.440 which is what you say when you're
01:23:21.400 talking to prospects and you have an
01:23:23.000 offthe call sop which is what do in
01:23:25.120 between the vast majority of companies
01:23:27.040 don't have an offthe call sop and
01:23:29.440 they're losing tons and tons of money
01:23:31.719 because they just say yeah just work the
01:23:33.480 leads in the meantime when the total
01:23:35.600 amount of output that a salesman has is
01:23:37.679 so correlated with the amount of
01:23:38.920 opportunities they have and they get
01:23:40.480 those opportunities by the time they
01:23:42.040 have when they're not on the call and so
01:23:44.280 they should have two separate checklists
01:23:45.840 if they don't have them in front of them
01:23:47.000 and this is what the best sales people
01:23:48.159 do is this is what I'm doing when I'm on
01:23:50.320 and this is what I'm doing when I'm off
01:23:51.600 and you can just switch hats as soon as
01:23:53.120 you're off you start at the top and
01:23:54.560 you're like I'm following with this
01:23:55.600 person I'm following with this person
01:23:57.080 I'm dragging this person forward I'm
01:23:58.679 canceling this appointment and they have
01:24:00.400 high
01:24:03.199 Activity one of the things that we do
01:24:05.280 across all our companies and I learned
01:24:06.679 This Acronym from my friend shiron
01:24:08.560 bamfam which is book a meeting from a
01:24:10.400 meeting which is that the best
01:24:11.639 salespeople never finish a call with a
01:24:13.480 prospect not knowing when the next time
01:24:15.159 they're going to talk to the prospect so
01:24:16.760 that Prospect should never fall into no
01:24:18.520 l they should never fall between the
01:24:19.920 cracks where they're like I don't know
01:24:21.480 and so if you get to the end of the call
01:24:22.560 and they're like yeah let's uh connect
01:24:23.840 offline we'll you know we'll Circle back
01:24:25.400 up and we'll find another time no you
01:24:27.639 have to address it at that time because
01:24:29.239 if for whatever reason like a Time
01:24:31.320 obstacle is still an obstacle and you
01:24:32.880 can resolve it right then you both have
01:24:34.320 your calendars up you can both make the
01:24:35.920 decision if someone's like well I'm not
01:24:37.440 sure then you actually address the
01:24:39.239 concern like isn't this a problem for
01:24:40.600 you how much you losing every day not
01:24:41.960 implementing this solution in your
01:24:43.000 business how much like how much of a
01:24:45.000 problem is this in your life and why
01:24:46.280 isn't it this something that we'd be
01:24:47.760 doing sooner right and so you want to
01:24:49.400 address those things because that is
01:24:51.080 these are obstacles and so if you just
01:24:52.760 get off the call Jolly then you actually
01:24:55.040 lose more sales so you always book a
01:24:56.960 meeting from the meeting here's three
01:24:58.440 more things that the best salese will do
01:25:00.840 number one is that they don't take
01:25:01.960 rejection personally because they're
01:25:03.400 going to reach out in more volume than
01:25:05.800 the mediocre salespeople and so you can
01:25:08.679 see on a CRM how many Outreach attempts
01:25:11.239 and how many follow-up attempts that A
01:25:13.520 salesperson is having between calls and
01:25:15.760 it correlates with the number of calls
01:25:17.679 that they take and so they work their
01:25:19.679 leads harder and that's because if
01:25:21.560 someone before they've scheduled a call
01:25:23.520 you know say has something mean they're
01:25:25.080 not like oh my gosh I can't believe this
01:25:27.000 or if someone no shows they're not like
01:25:28.560 well I'm not going to work the rest of
01:25:29.480 my leads no one really cares about me
01:25:31.239 like wo is me it's no they know it's a
01:25:33.080 numbers game and they just keep plowing
01:25:34.880 something that I've noticed the best
01:25:36.440 salespeople do is they have something
01:25:37.800 called a kill list and so those are
01:25:40.040 those prospects that you're like this is
01:25:41.679 a whale or this is a really good
01:25:43.239 Prospect and they they sure they have in
01:25:45.679 the CRM sure they have them in the place
01:25:47.239 that they're supposed to have them but
01:25:48.360 they also have it somewhere else that's
01:25:49.960 visible so they can always think about
01:25:51.960 it and like that's like an everyday list
01:25:53.960 it's like I got to get back to these two
01:25:55.480 guys I got to make sure that these ones
01:25:57.440 I'm going to put extra attention to
01:25:59.440 because they're high value deals now the
01:26:01.600 last element of what the best salese do
01:26:04.440 for increasing their number of leads is
01:26:06.159 that they create their own opportunities
01:26:08.080 so sure they're going to get the inbound
01:26:09.719 leads from marketing they're going to
01:26:11.159 get the people you know the leads that
01:26:12.560 are handed to them but the best salese
01:26:16.199 know the value of referrals and so the
01:26:18.800 way they do that is at the end of the
01:26:20.080 call or at the time that it makes sense
01:26:21.719 they say hey do you know anybody else or
01:26:24.520 my favorite way of asking is who do you
01:26:26.159 know because it forces the prospect to
01:26:28.239 answer the question with a not yes no
01:26:30.040 but with a name you say who do you know
01:26:32.639 who is as awesome as you now it's a
01:26:34.320 compliment who would also benefit from
01:26:36.080 this so now I'm giving them a compliment
01:26:38.520 by by by asking them for the referral so
01:26:40.600 I kind of like have a like a nice guy
01:26:42.040 sandwich there so like you're amazing
01:26:44.000 who else do you know who's like you who
01:26:45.159 would love to do this with you or with
01:26:46.600 us who could benefit from XYZ right now
01:26:49.800 sometimes if they say no one then
01:26:51.600 sometimes like this is where Rapport is
01:26:52.920 important but you could say say
01:26:54.360 something like why do you hate me so
01:26:56.040 much and they're like what do you mean
01:26:57.560 it's like well I only can assume that
01:26:59.040 you hate us because you don't want
01:27:00.239 anybody else to know about this amazing
01:27:02.960 thing and you probably hate your friends
01:27:04.520 because you want them to suffer as well
01:27:06.719 right and if it's because you don't
01:27:08.080 believe me then let's talk about that
01:27:09.400 but otherwise like why are we not
01:27:10.520 getting your friends in here because I
01:27:12.080 can promise you you'll be far more
01:27:13.119 successful if you have more people you
01:27:14.159 know who are in it so in the spirit of
01:27:16.320 bamfam book a meeting from a meeting if
01:27:17.880 we consider this to be a meeting if you
01:27:19.480 would like us to help you more with your
01:27:21.280 sales process acquisition. just started
01:27:23.199 a workshop division where my sales
01:27:25.159 director my team will talk to you
01:27:27.080 specifically about your sales your
01:27:29.159 process your scripting so we can
01:27:30.639 Implement some of the things that we
01:27:31.560 know work in our portfolio into your
01:27:32.920 business ASAP we do other stuff at the
01:27:34.920 workshop but we also talk about sales if
01:27:36.760 that's at all interesting you can book
01:27:37.960 your next meeting by going to acis.com
01:27:39.679 clicking the scale button and following
01:27:41.119 the steps and if you're qualified my
01:27:42.639 guys will reach
01:27:45.119 out when I had a team in a different
01:27:47.719 portfolio company we had one guy who was
01:27:49.400 outperforming everyone else by a huge
01:27:50.840 margin this one wasn't as big as the
01:27:52.239 pull-up thing that was massive this was
01:27:54.199 was about 50% higher than the number
01:27:55.840 number two guy and we were like what is
01:27:57.760 this guy doing he was brand new and that
01:27:59.320 was what was interesting is like brand
01:28:00.639 new going to the top leaderboard is not
01:28:02.000 very common because that means that
01:28:03.800 they're doing a different process right
01:28:06.080 and so he was following the script and
01:28:07.560 we listened to the calls like this is
01:28:08.679 the same call and so when we called him
01:28:10.239 up we said what are you doing
01:28:11.000 differently and the thing is he was
01:28:12.639 multiplying his leads and so what he did
01:28:15.000 was at the end of the calls he was just
01:28:16.280 asking who they knew who would also
01:28:17.639 benefit from this thing and I think they
01:28:19.199 were they were selling um some sort of
01:28:22.199 uh tickets of some sort and so he was
01:28:24.520 saying who else wants to come with you
01:28:26.040 who else would you like to bring and
01:28:28.400 it's just a simple little thing that he
01:28:30.239 was doing but by doing that he was
01:28:32.000 increasing his sales by 50% because the
01:28:34.920 referrals even though only one out of
01:28:36.639 three or one out of four people would
01:28:38.040 refer the referral close ratees like 80
01:28:40.400 or 90% And so if you think okay I take
01:28:43.400 you know four calls and I close one and
01:28:47.320 I ask for referrals in all all four and
01:28:49.639 only one of them gives me referral but
01:28:51.080 then that referral then closes then I
01:28:54.239 take my one sale out of four and turn it
01:28:56.119 to two out of five if you're a business
01:28:58.119 owner thinking about how valuable just
01:28:59.960 implementing that is consistently is
01:29:01.880 that your cost to acquire a customer you
01:29:03.480 just you cut in half by taking one
01:29:05.760 customer and getting a referral from
01:29:07.560 that customer and if one out of three
01:29:09.119 customers refer someone then you cut
01:29:10.520 your cost to Aire customer by a third
01:29:13.000 and this is the type of stuff is
01:29:14.080 advertising becomes more expensive
01:29:15.560 because it always will become more
01:29:16.639 expensive that the businesses that do
01:29:18.520 this the salesmen that do this will be
01:29:20.440 the ones that win in the future so now
01:29:22.480 we have a Salesman who has the max
01:29:24.080 maximum number of hours the maximum
01:29:25.679 number of days they're pulling up
01:29:27.360 appointments so that their time on call
01:29:29.560 closing with the best people is
01:29:31.119 maximized they're following up before
01:29:32.760 they're following up after they're doing
01:29:34.800 personalized reach outs and saying like
01:29:36.800 hey voice memo hey video hey I've got
01:29:39.119 this thing for you that I've got set up
01:29:40.600 for the call um what size shirt do you
01:29:44.000 want I've set aside uh thing here was
01:29:46.040 one of the things we did at the gym hey
01:29:47.199 what color shirt do you want hey what
01:29:49.159 boxing gloves hey what you do a tiny
01:29:51.360 little thing hey I've got three gift
01:29:53.199 cards here I got one for Amazon one for
01:29:54.560 Starbucks and one for whatever which one
01:29:56.080 would you prefer right you ask a
01:29:57.679 preference question prior to the call
01:29:59.679 and more people show because the thing
01:30:02.000 is is you're like well shoot this guy's
01:30:03.520 doing this thing the least I can do is
01:30:05.600 show up and so they're maximizing the
01:30:07.360 number of scheduled appointments they're
01:30:08.960 maximizing the number of shows they're
01:30:10.960 maximizing the number of opportunities
01:30:12.400 they're getting from those opportunities
01:30:14.400 and now we get to the call so now we got
01:30:16.679 to close
01:30:19.440 them understand the value of preparation
01:30:22.880 you would be amazed at how much of a
01:30:25.080 genius you sound like if you just do 5
01:30:28.040 minutes of research before a call and so
01:30:30.280 my rule of thumb for research is that if
01:30:32.320 it's something that you do all the time
01:30:34.080 it's about 10% of the time that you're
01:30:35.840 going to be on a call or meeting that
01:30:38.119 you can do in prep so if you have a
01:30:39.360 2-hour call then you've got 12 minutes
01:30:41.400 of prep if you've got a 60-minute call
01:30:43.480 then you do six minutes of prep now this
01:30:45.080 is something that if you do it all the
01:30:46.199 time if this is like I'm doing a
01:30:47.760 quarterly meeting then it reverses it's
01:30:49.760 like 6 hours of prep for 1 hour of
01:30:52.159 presentation if it's something that you
01:30:53.360 don't do often and so sales people do
01:30:55.760 the same call over and over again but
01:30:57.320 the thing that's different the tiny bit
01:30:59.000 of difference is the prospect they're
01:31:00.360 speaking with and so like this applies
01:31:02.440 to everything like if you're picking a
01:31:03.719 girl up at her house if you do 5 Seconds
01:31:06.159 of research in the car before you go in
01:31:07.760 and you look at what her dad does and
01:31:09.000 look at the company of the of the father
01:31:10.639 and say hey so Mr so and so really nice
01:31:12.960 to meet you so I see you work at you
01:31:14.159 know whatever engineering like do you
01:31:15.480 like that stuff I see that they just had
01:31:16.719 a a press lease coming out do you have
01:31:18.080 any involvement in that this guy would
01:31:20.159 immediately see you no matter how you're
01:31:22.080 dressed what you look like as it's a
01:31:24.440 it's a check they're like whoo like I
01:31:26.800 will respect this person because he did
01:31:29.000 me the honor of actually taking some
01:31:31.320 time to look me up and figure out more
01:31:34.000 about my business he didn't show up like
01:31:36.040 everybody else does not knowing which
01:31:37.760 way is Sunday trying to figure things
01:31:39.520 out as they go I'm telling you the best
01:31:42.080 salespeople take those five minutes they
01:31:44.280 do that tiny bit of research and the
01:31:46.440 amount of Rapport that you build in that
01:31:49.119 first one minute from having those
01:31:52.560 Secrets the person is then like oh wow
01:31:55.119 they know about me think about what it
01:31:57.119 takes to close someone no like and Trust
01:31:59.520 well all of a sudden you feel known
01:32:02.080 because they did it you like people who
01:32:04.600 know more about you and what else do you
01:32:06.880 do you trust people who know more about
01:32:09.600 you because you approximate friendship
01:32:11.520 you approximate a relationship and you
01:32:13.520 do and you get to do a ton of that at
01:32:15.480 the first second of the call rather than
01:32:17.520 taking the five first minutes the call
01:32:19.320 to show that you don't know what you're
01:32:20.719 doing right as I started selling gym
01:32:22.480 owners rather than weight loss when I
01:32:24.080 was selling my turnaround business I
01:32:26.520 started getting leads but I didn't have
01:32:28.360 any like methodology so like I had a
01:32:30.560 webinar it didn't work and so I just
01:32:31.960 started finding people on Google using
01:32:33.719 their emails and so I'd find their
01:32:35.600 social profiles and I'd liter have to
01:32:37.239 piece together like a profile of who
01:32:38.719 this person was cuz the only thing I was
01:32:40.520 collecting was an email for this webinar
01:32:42.639 and so I'd find like three or four
01:32:44.119 social profiles and then I would connect
01:32:45.880 with them and I would do some research
01:32:47.480 so that I could make my reach out not
01:32:48.960 look sketchy as hell and so when I would
01:32:51.480 do my reach out that I would have all
01:32:53.400 this data that I put as almost like a
01:32:54.920 little profile together um about them
01:32:57.280 and so when I hopped on the phone they
01:32:58.920 were like whoa like you know a lot about
01:33:01.440 my gym and I was like well yeah and I
01:33:03.159 saw that because I look at the images
01:33:05.040 like so I saw your square footage layout
01:33:06.880 I think if you move this here this might
01:33:08.679 actually be able to allow you to double
01:33:10.560 the amount of usable square footage that
01:33:12.159 you have for the sessions and that would
01:33:13.679 help me sell more people into your gym
01:33:15.280 so I don't know if you're open to
01:33:16.159 something like that but now I'm coming
01:33:17.719 with like I see the problem I also have
01:33:19.679 the solution cuz I thought about it
01:33:20.800 before we got on the phone cuz I don't
01:33:22.199 want to waste your time trying to figure
01:33:23.400 things out now I want to figure them out
01:33:25.159 beforeand come with you with Solutions
01:33:26.639 and this is when I was starting out so I
01:33:27.800 didn't have a reputation yet so I had to
01:33:29.719 build the reputation by showing up and
01:33:32.360 providing more value than other people
01:33:33.920 were ahead of time and this is where
01:33:35.320 like if you're new and you're coming
01:33:36.400 into a space you win through prep like
01:33:39.320 the big guys have the reputation the
01:33:41.760 small guys went through
01:33:45.679 preparation the best sales people take
01:33:47.760 notes this is one of those things that
01:33:49.960 is just like prep but it preps you for
01:33:52.920 the next call
01:33:54.239 and so you do your public preparation
01:33:56.639 with what you can find and observe you
01:33:58.760 do your second call preparation with
01:34:00.440 what you find out on the phone and I'm
01:34:02.440 telling you if you hop on the phone and
01:34:03.679 say oh yeah so you've got your daughter
01:34:05.360 Sarah and Jessica and they're at you
01:34:07.400 know Colorado and they're finishing up
01:34:09.239 and you've got X Y and Z happening in
01:34:11.280 the business is that correct okay cool
01:34:13.280 just making sure just reading over some
01:34:14.679 of the past Nots got on the call they're
01:34:16.560 like oh wow I don't have to resay my
01:34:18.679 whole life story again this guy now when
01:34:20.760 this guy makes recommendations I assume
01:34:22.840 he does it within the cont context of my
01:34:24.199 business because one of the big things
01:34:26.040 when you are selling something is that
01:34:27.520 people want to make sure that it not
01:34:28.600 only that it works but it's going to
01:34:29.800 work for them and so you can address
01:34:32.800 that concern before it ever comes up by
01:34:36.280 proving that your recommendations are
01:34:38.080 contextual this is also what switches
01:34:40.119 you from being a Salesman to a
01:34:41.840 consultant this is what switches you
01:34:43.719 from somebody who's just trying to close
01:34:45.360 to somebody who's trying to
01:34:48.719 help the most brilliant salespeople
01:34:51.159 listen more than they talk and this is
01:34:53.080 one that people get wrong all the time
01:34:55.239 is that they see super talkative people
01:34:57.080 I mean moms in high school are like you
01:34:58.600 should get into sales cuz you don't shut
01:35:00.159 up uh no that's not not always the case
01:35:03.520 that's what that's what bad salesp
01:35:04.719 people look like uh and unfortunately
01:35:06.920 the thing is is the best salesp people
01:35:09.400 don't come off as salespeople they just
01:35:12.320 close and so people don't feel sold they
01:35:16.400 feel like they bought and so everybody
01:35:19.080 buys stuff every day all the time and
01:35:21.560 they're buying from companies that have
01:35:22.760 salespeople and they don't know it so
01:35:25.840 when you go to a restaurant and they ask
01:35:27.000 you if you want dessert that's a sale
01:35:29.040 they get commissions on those things and
01:35:30.840 if they do it in a weird way you're like
01:35:32.560 uh I don't want to be sold if they do in
01:35:33.920 a great way you're like oh I'm so glad
01:35:35.000 that person made that recommendation and
01:35:36.600 so you never felt like you got sold you
01:35:38.400 felt like you bought and so the problem
01:35:40.239 is that the reputation of salese is
01:35:41.679 terrible because you only remember the
01:35:43.040 bad ones we actually did this big study
01:35:45.280 because we have a huge amount of sales
01:35:46.520 calls that we can look at across the
01:35:47.560 whole portfolio and we use software that
01:35:49.119 analyzes the calls with AI and all that
01:35:50.760 stuff we can see what's talk time versus
01:35:52.400 listen time and the best best
01:35:53.800 salespeople listen twice as much as they
01:35:55.760 talk and so the little isms that I have
01:35:58.840 for this is that the person who's
01:36:00.040 answering the questions is the one
01:36:01.239 getting interrogated you don't want to
01:36:03.040 be the one getting interrogated and
01:36:04.840 whenever you answer questions you give
01:36:06.719 the other person something to attack and
01:36:08.960 so you want them to be answering so that
01:36:11.280 you have things that you can pick apart
01:36:12.719 and move around if you're the one
01:36:14.400 answering questions then you're the one
01:36:16.199 who's getting picked apart and has
01:36:18.119 things that they can disagree with I
01:36:19.679 want to be like smoke right they can't
01:36:22.280 they can't catch anything that I say and
01:36:24.280 so if someone says you know hey well
01:36:26.360 tell me tell me what makes you better
01:36:27.679 than your competition I'd be like well
01:36:28.920 what things you're looking
01:36:30.600 for right back to them right it's like
01:36:33.080 it's like hot potato it's like right
01:36:34.199 back to you well I would want this this
01:36:36.320 and this and this I'm like why are those
01:36:37.880 things important to you right back to
01:36:40.280 you right like I I can do this all day
01:36:42.840 right like I I cannot answer because the
01:36:44.480 thing is is that they believe nothing
01:36:45.880 that you say they believe everything
01:36:47.280 that they say and so I need them to say
01:36:49.239 that it's a good idea not me when I
01:36:50.960 started selling weight loss I realized
01:36:53.000 really quickly that I had an agenda of
01:36:55.400 what I wanted to tell people they needed
01:36:57.280 to do and I realized that I didn't have
01:37:00.280 time in 15 minutes to re-educate someone
01:37:02.960 their last 10 years of life of all the
01:37:05.159 experiences good and bad that they had
01:37:07.320 prior to me what I needed to do in that
01:37:09.199 moment was get them to buy and then I
01:37:10.880 could spend the rest of my time trying
01:37:12.280 to do the real education stuff and so I
01:37:15.159 wanted to Simply align with where they
01:37:16.880 were coming from to get them to make the
01:37:18.760 sale and so that was why I started
01:37:22.320 asking what have you done before for
01:37:23.840 what did you like what did you not like
01:37:25.000 rather than picking apart the things
01:37:27.080 they did and then they like I actually
01:37:28.480 really like that about that other thing
01:37:30.480 lost the sale only takes a few times of
01:37:32.520 doing that to be like I'm going to shut
01:37:33.679 the [ __ ] up and just let them tell me
01:37:35.679 what they liked and then I'll say we're
01:37:37.440 like that and not like that and so the
01:37:39.159 whole concept here is you want to
01:37:41.520 educate the prospect so that they can
01:37:43.560 come to their own conclusion and so the
01:37:46.000 only gaps that you're filling is is hard
01:37:48.880 information and I only give that
01:37:51.000 information after I already know it's
01:37:52.560 the right answer and so just like
01:37:54.920 lawyers don't ask questions when they're
01:37:56.679 on the stand that they don't already
01:37:58.400 know the answers to should never ask for
01:38:00.360 the sale unless you already know they're
01:38:01.760 going to buy and so there are times and
01:38:03.639 this is where pattern recognition is
01:38:04.880 helpful for salese this is what the
01:38:06.440 brilliant salese do is that if they're
01:38:08.639 like I don't think he's ready there I
01:38:09.880 don't think he's ready yet and it's like
01:38:11.080 you don't you don't go for the kill you
01:38:12.880 just ask more questions like I feel some
01:38:14.520 hesitation like what are your main
01:38:16.080 concerns right now like I'm feeling some
01:38:17.760 hesitation around price talk to me about
01:38:19.679 that there's two ways by the way if
01:38:21.199 you're weirded out about asking
01:38:22.520 questions is that you can both give
01:38:24.520 commands or ask questions and so you can
01:38:26.719 change the the Cadence up in the script
01:38:29.040 by saying so instead of saying for
01:38:30.360 example hey how's it going it's an easy
01:38:32.840 first thing a lot of people say on the
01:38:34.000 first thing of the call but if I say
01:38:35.320 tell me about your day it's a very
01:38:37.199 different thing because it it people
01:38:39.760 have automatic responses to questions
01:38:41.440 they hear all the time and so if you
01:38:42.800 want to break a pattern with somebody
01:38:44.239 and then get them more present you say
01:38:45.800 tell me about your
01:38:47.080 T and then like oh uh I mean it it was
01:38:50.000 good I had a couple calls before this
01:38:51.280 and you're like oh that's fantastic was
01:38:52.400 that related to this thing cuz I looked
01:38:53.960 looked you up online totally different
01:38:55.679 perspective on that salesperson the
01:38:57.119 first 30 seconds right so they listen
01:38:59.880 more than they talk they are like smoke
01:39:03.000 you only answer questions with questions
01:39:05.960 unless you already know that the
01:39:07.520 statement that you're going to say is in
01:39:09.719 alignment with what you know the person
01:39:11.440 wants and so if they're like tell me why
01:39:13.920 you're different then I'd be like well
01:39:15.280 what have you done in the past because
01:39:17.000 then it'll give me more context so I can
01:39:18.560 help explain it now they're going to say
01:39:20.159 all these things I'll be like what did
01:39:21.239 you like about that what did you not
01:39:22.679 like about that and so when I get to the
01:39:24.239 point where I actually have to say what
01:39:25.400 what are things about I'm going to
01:39:26.560 highlight all the things they liked
01:39:27.840 about the other stuff and I'm going to
01:39:28.920 not highlight the things they didn't
01:39:30.159 like about the other stuff and all of a
01:39:31.360 sudden they be like this is perfect i'
01:39:32.719 be like what do you know I just asked
01:39:34.360 you the question of the things you
01:39:35.400 wanted and as long as they are the
01:39:36.920 things that we can actually provide I
01:39:38.320 highlighted those features about our
01:39:40.320 thing because I already knew which piano
01:39:42.239 keys to play cuz you told
01:39:45.440 me they breathe the script and so the
01:39:48.400 reason I use that is because that is the
01:39:51.199 best description I can give is that they
01:39:52.719 can they can say it without thinking
01:39:54.599 just like you breathe without thinking
01:39:56.199 they can say the script without thinking
01:39:57.920 because you can't listen to a prospect
01:40:00.119 if you're waiting to talk because you're
01:40:01.880 trying to remember what you're going to
01:40:03.119 say next you need to know all of the
01:40:05.599 script like the Bible or like something
01:40:07.840 that you've memorized in the past so
01:40:10.159 that you can be 100% present with the
01:40:12.320 Prospect and listening and so my
01:40:14.679 favorite ISM around this is again and
01:40:17.800 the first time I learned this was I saw
01:40:19.800 an exceptional sales trainer training a
01:40:22.760 rep and he was just drilling them on the
01:40:25.599 opening 30 seconds of the script and so
01:40:28.520 they did the script and I heard and I
01:40:30.440 and I was watching him listen to them
01:40:32.599 while giving them visual cues and so
01:40:34.560 this is this was a huge advancement in
01:40:36.080 terms of my understanding of selling
01:40:37.639 happened because before this I knew how
01:40:39.400 a sell but I couldn't transfer the skill
01:40:41.159 but this guy was sitting there and he
01:40:42.760 was like yep yep yep pause harder on
01:40:45.119 this word do it again nice do it again
01:40:49.159 nice one more time nice keep going and
01:40:52.880 so he would get them to drill it three
01:40:54.880 times in a row the right way after
01:40:56.480 making the correction and then he would
01:40:58.159 keep going in the script and so the
01:41:00.480 point was is that if you're a
01:41:02.280 salesperson you need to be able to do it
01:41:04.800 again and again and again because the
01:41:08.960 word concision matters a lot you don't
01:41:11.360 want to be one of these salespeople that
01:41:12.599 takes a hundred words to say something
01:41:14.199 you could say in five it'll also make
01:41:16.000 your sales way longer so again the best
01:41:18.440 salesperson can take more calls because
01:41:20.480 they shorten the call required a medoc
01:41:23.480 salesperson will do the script in the
01:41:25.119 beginning and it'll close and they will
01:41:27.280 have coughed right before they asked for
01:41:28.960 the close and then the person closes and
01:41:31.280 so they get reinforcement for coughing
01:41:33.119 and so the next sales call they take
01:41:34.880 they add a cough in and whether that
01:41:37.520 person closes or not they're like well
01:41:38.719 it worked on that other one and so all
01:41:40.000 of a sudden they add coughing in right
01:41:41.320 before they close now the next time on
01:41:44.199 the time that they close let's say on
01:41:45.440 their fourth call after this they also
01:41:47.599 added a second question in before the
01:41:49.520 close so they add the second question in
01:41:51.639 and then you see where this happens is
01:41:52.800 that they cough and add a second
01:41:54.239 question to every single call that they
01:41:55.840 do and by doing this over time the
01:41:58.480 length of the script and the length of
01:42:00.000 the things that salespeople do continues
01:42:01.679 to expand because they get positive
01:42:03.360 reinforcement but the reality is that
01:42:04.880 that person might have just been willing
01:42:06.000 to buy no matter what and so the script
01:42:07.920 gets longer and longer even though it
01:42:09.320 might not have nothing to do with what
01:42:12.000 was required to close and so you want to
01:42:14.480 be as concise as humanly possible and
01:42:16.080 this is with the best sales people do in
01:42:17.960 order to close the most sales per day
01:42:20.599 per unit of time because the less time
01:42:22.360 you're on the phone after make the sale
01:42:23.679 the more time you have to fill your
01:42:24.679 calendar back up and close more deals
01:42:26.320 and so the three tactics this is the
01:42:27.639 sales managers is that you rehearse the
01:42:29.920 script every morning they do role plays
01:42:33.239 meaning let's pretend like I'm a
01:42:34.800 prospect like you got to you got to get
01:42:36.199 over whatever your weirdness is with
01:42:38.040 role playing like I don't know what it
01:42:40.119 is but so many managers like don't want
01:42:41.800 to role play like Get over yourself you
01:42:45.040 have to role play in order for them to
01:42:46.679 get good and when you do the role
01:42:49.000 playing you work on one specific part of
01:42:51.639 the script because if you're doing every
01:42:53.199 morning you're going to be able to work
01:42:54.000 through things pretty quickly but you're
01:42:55.239 like today we're just going to focus on
01:42:56.639 the intro today we're just going to
01:42:58.040 focus on the close today I just want you
01:42:59.800 to focus on how we're overcoming spouse
01:43:02.000 overcomes I want you to overcome I have
01:43:03.719 to think about it issues I want you to
01:43:05.159 give me two or three bangs in a row to
01:43:07.119 overcome that obstacle because you seem
01:43:09.599 to be struggling with it right and so by
01:43:11.560 and you just keep hitting it again and
01:43:13.239 again and again so that when it comes up
01:43:15.679 they just breathe it out rather than
01:43:17.199 thinking about it also because no one
01:43:19.360 can improve multiple things at the same
01:43:20.800 time so when you say hey there's nine
01:43:22.080 things you did wrong one it's a
01:43:23.159 incredibly discouraging second they
01:43:25.040 can't improve any of them and so if you
01:43:26.679 look at any good skills coach whether
01:43:28.199 it's a basketball coach or it's a
01:43:29.400 painting coach or a sales coach they
01:43:31.239 work they might see you have a hundred
01:43:32.960 things wrong with your game they're just
01:43:34.520 going to focus on one at a time until
01:43:36.520 they clean them all up and then all of a
01:43:38.040 sudden you become an exceptional sales
01:43:39.239 person so I said I had nine but I have
01:43:41.080 way more than nine so enjoy so here's
01:43:42.719 number
01:43:44.800 10 they kill zombies up front now that's
01:43:47.960 the term that we use internally you can
01:43:49.599 say diffuse the bomb which is one that I
01:43:51.119 did earlier in my career is what I used
01:43:52.320 to say but I'm Middle Eastern so you
01:43:54.159 know we had to change that the formal
01:43:55.719 definition that I use is you've got
01:43:57.040 obstacles and you've got objections an
01:43:58.599 obstacle occurs before you've mentioned
01:44:00.400 the price and so if someone says for
01:44:02.119 example um you know I have a special
01:44:04.280 snowflake thyroid issue right and you're
01:44:06.520 trying to say like you need to do this
01:44:07.719 thing to lose weight you know that
01:44:08.840 that's going to blow up on you in the
01:44:10.040 sale see we're doing bomb references so
01:44:11.840 you have to address it up front and it's
01:44:13.320 much easier to address things before you
01:44:15.480 ask for money than after if you do it
01:44:17.679 after it's called an objection all right
01:44:19.599 so I say obstacles are up front you want
01:44:21.080 to avoid them you want to move around
01:44:22.199 them right I mean you have to Crush
01:44:23.400 through them realistically but you get
01:44:25.360 through those and then objections you
01:44:27.000 have to handle but now the the time is
01:44:29.199 ticking on the bomb like now you have a
01:44:30.719 short period of time before it blows up
01:44:32.599 on you right uh or the zombie is about
01:44:34.840 to bite you whatever analogy you want
01:44:36.599 spouse for example or decision maker or
01:44:39.159 I'm not going to have time to do this
01:44:40.639 thing or there's elements of this you
01:44:42.760 know program or implementation that
01:44:44.199 aren't a fit for me you want to address
01:44:46.040 all that stuff up front so that you've
01:44:48.239 handled everything before the stakes get
01:44:50.800 lifted When you mention price and then
01:44:52.679 you go for for the close and the
01:44:54.159 obstacles and objections that you handle
01:44:56.239 are always the same and so they're going
01:44:58.199 to Bubble up to three main things one is
01:44:59.880 going to be circumstances so
01:45:01.360 circumstances is going to be time it's
01:45:03.199 going to be money it's going to be
01:45:05.199 things about this specific program or
01:45:07.000 implementation those are all
01:45:08.400 circumstances those are outside the next
01:45:10.159 is going to be other people it's going
01:45:11.520 to be my wife my employees my kid my
01:45:15.000 some my business partner somebody else
01:45:17.679 has decision-making Authority and the
01:45:19.239 third is going to be myself somebody who
01:45:21.400 themselves doubts that they can do it or
01:45:23.719 that they will be successful or that
01:45:25.360 it's the way they want it to be done the
01:45:27.040 good news is that most of the time when
01:45:29.679 you're diffusing these bombs they start
01:45:31.560 with the outside because time money fit
01:45:34.840 is what I like to call it are things
01:45:36.480 that are really easy to cast blame to
01:45:38.679 and it's and it's almost a it's a it's a
01:45:40.360 response right it's like they don't have
01:45:42.080 to think about like I don't have time I
01:45:43.159 don't have the money I don't have I
01:45:44.119 don't have the card I want like I don't
01:45:45.199 have the you know whatever if they talk
01:45:46.800 about an authority figure then it means
01:45:48.679 that like I would do it but this
01:45:51.159 person's in the way and so now you're
01:45:53.360 one step closer to the decision maker
01:45:55.320 once you handle that if you have
01:45:56.840 somebody who says I need to think about
01:45:58.360 it that's actually great cuz it means
01:45:59.920 you're already two layers of the onion
01:46:01.360 deeper to just like you're talking to
01:46:03.320 somebody who's in power who can make the
01:46:04.599 decision great now you just have to help
01:46:06.679 help them make the decision and so you
01:46:09.119 should know all of the key fundamentals
01:46:11.480 of how to overcome these now you can
01:46:13.679 memorize each of them which I highly
01:46:15.040 recommend but I think it's also good to
01:46:17.119 understand the fundamentals and so this
01:46:18.280 is what the best salespeople do is that
01:46:21.239 they have key
01:46:23.960 stories or metaphors to break the belief
01:46:27.639 that the person has around that obstacle
01:46:30.320 so for example if someone says hey um I
01:46:34.320 can't decide today because you know my
01:46:35.639 husband and I make all of our decisions
01:46:36.960 together right now this depends on the
01:46:39.679 nature of your sale if you're in a
01:46:41.360 transactional sale and I would say like
01:46:43.080 a consumer based sale that's under 1,000
01:46:44.840 bucks maybe 2,000 bucks usually you have
01:46:46.920 to do that right there if you have like
01:46:49.880 a B2B sale that's going to be a multi
01:46:52.480 you know multi call sale then you might
01:46:54.239 have to bring in stakeholders and so
01:46:56.280 this is one of the nuances that depends
01:46:57.679 on the thing you're selling in the price
01:46:58.840 point but the way that the best sales
01:47:02.040 people do this is that you play out
01:47:03.360 something in the past and you play it
01:47:04.560 out in the future okay so with a
01:47:06.639 decision maker you'd say hey so let me
01:47:08.920 tell you about this girl Susan she was
01:47:10.400 just like you and um she actually had
01:47:13.280 the same issue come up where she was
01:47:14.920 like I don't do anything without the
01:47:16.080 consent of my husband and you know what
01:47:18.080 happened she walked out her husband said
01:47:20.280 I don't want you to spend the money I
01:47:21.639 actually saw her a few years
01:47:23.360 later and when I talked to her I said
01:47:25.560 hey so how's how's things going with the
01:47:27.000 you know the fitness stuff she was like
01:47:29.280 oh they're they're not and I was like oh
01:47:31.599 why she was like well my husband never
01:47:33.199 lets me do anything and I was like oh
01:47:34.560 geez um that's got to be kind of rough
01:47:37.320 and she's like yeah it sucks and so the
01:47:40.280 thing is is that if you play it out into
01:47:42.400 the future like you're going to end up
01:47:44.199 resenting that person because they're
01:47:45.560 not letting you do what you want and so
01:47:47.080 I think what you're asking for is
01:47:48.119 permission when you really need support
01:47:49.840 that's how you how you like you go from
01:47:51.800 past to Future right and so then you can
01:47:54.960 play it out with this person so so let's
01:47:56.239 play it out five years so over the last
01:47:57.960 five years you've gained 5 pounds a year
01:47:59.320 so you're 25 pounds heavier so 5 years
01:48:01.119 from now if you're 25 pounds heavier
01:48:02.440 than you are right now they're like oh
01:48:04.280 my God if I'm 25 pounds heavier than I
01:48:05.679 am but that's just the track you're on
01:48:07.880 and so let's play it out it like what if
01:48:10.360 they say
01:48:11.639 no and so sometimes they're like well
01:48:13.760 then I would do it anyways then you're
01:48:14.679 like awesome let's sign you up now one
01:48:16.520 out of three times that's actually what
01:48:17.719 happened which is crazy I still am blown
01:48:19.520 away by that but then the two out of
01:48:21.159 three times then I go you want
01:48:22.480 permission not support now if you're
01:48:24.560 looking at time or money for example
01:48:27.280 then you say hey we need uh we need
01:48:29.280 resourcefulness not resources so it's
01:48:30.920 like you have your little isms that you
01:48:32.199 can remember if it's time then it's well
01:48:35.280 is it a seasonal thing because if it's a
01:48:37.000 seasonal thing means you're busy right
01:48:38.400 now uh and you might be you know less
01:48:40.360 busy later that assumes that you'll
01:48:42.320 never be busy again and so do you want
01:48:44.679 this thing to be long lasting this
01:48:45.920 implementation or do you want it to be
01:48:47.360 just like only for the time that you're
01:48:48.480 not busy and then you'll fall off again
01:48:49.639 when when you get busy well shoot I want
01:48:51.679 it to last forever it's like okay well
01:48:53.000 then you should probably start when
01:48:53.800 you're busy cuz that's what I'm going to
01:48:55.159 be giving you the most support is now so
01:48:56.800 that when you get to the the free time
01:48:58.360 it'll be easy coasting and when you get
01:48:59.880 busy again you know how to stick with it
01:49:01.440 because you had the support right and so
01:49:03.440 again it's like you have to be able to
01:49:04.719 dismantle these things because you
01:49:06.320 understand all of these there's a
01:49:08.360 fundamental underlying fallacy of giving
01:49:10.520 away power to something else because
01:49:12.880 people don't want to make mistakes they
01:49:15.040 don't want to fail and so they come up
01:49:16.960 with all of these excuses they come up
01:49:19.080 with time they say like that's the
01:49:20.880 seasonal thing you can have time in
01:49:22.159 terms of the money micro which is I
01:49:23.560 don't have time in my day I'm like well
01:49:25.440 you're here so when were you imagining
01:49:28.000 this is why you do this up front when
01:49:29.360 were you imagining how much time can you
01:49:30.760 dedicate to this implementation to this
01:49:32.119 SEO agency to this weight loss program
01:49:34.119 whatever it is right if you ask that up
01:49:36.520 front then if they say oh I don't have
01:49:39.199 time with it then you can say well what
01:49:40.760 changed between then and now just so I
01:49:42.840 have understanding did I ask the
01:49:44.880 question in a weird way that made you
01:49:46.960 like not understand it um and again this
01:49:49.159 is where tone matters a lot cuz now
01:49:50.560 you're in the red zone right now it's
01:49:52.199 like the bomb's way more sensitive cuz
01:49:54.280 the the the the time ticker is going and
01:49:56.440 so we want to be extra this is where
01:49:58.440 Rapport is so important in the beginning
01:50:00.639 because I I'll add this in this is a
01:50:02.719 bonus one I call it the ghetto tone okay
01:50:05.400 and I learned this from Sam back so he
01:50:08.199 had a personal training business and
01:50:09.400 that's why I I shadowed underneath when
01:50:11.320 I got into fitness he let me just work
01:50:12.880 for him for minimum wage uh and so I
01:50:14.760 learned how the gym business worked but
01:50:16.159 anyways I saw him have this you know
01:50:18.280 rich white lady doesn't put her weights
01:50:20.159 back right and he was still training at
01:50:22.360 the time like he was training sessions a
01:50:23.880 little bit um and so he was like girl
01:50:27.840 he's like I know you ain't about to
01:50:29.119 leave my gym without putting your
01:50:30.040 weights back and he's a Persian dude
01:50:32.239 right but he would get into this kind of
01:50:33.560 like ghetto like whatever you want to
01:50:36.320 call it way of talking and she'd be like
01:50:39.520 fine I'll go put him back and I thought
01:50:42.320 about that and I was like man if I had
01:50:44.320 just been like hey Susan can you put
01:50:45.599 your weights
01:50:46.760 back like she's like I pay for personal
01:50:50.520 training you can put my weights back
01:50:52.800 like that could get really bad really
01:50:54.719 fast but when you say it like that all
01:50:56.760 of a sudden it's like I'm communicating
01:50:58.840 the same thing and I get the desired
01:51:00.360 result and they think it's fun and
01:51:02.000 light-hearted and so in the same sense
01:51:03.960 when you're in the clothes I use a ton
01:51:06.800 of humor and that tonality to diffuse
01:51:11.239 hard conversations so I say like girl I
01:51:14.320 was like five minutes ago I like you had
01:51:16.000 four hours a week I was like what
01:51:17.119 happened to my four hours if I say that
01:51:19.320 no one's going be upset with me they' be
01:51:20.960 like ah well I mean I didn't know that
01:51:23.360 it was going to be X Y and Z and I'll be
01:51:25.760 like fine I know like and then then then
01:51:29.239 tone switch and you're like what's
01:51:31.079 really going
01:51:33.079 on and then you get the real stuff
01:51:35.960 because guess
01:51:38.840 what closers ask hard questions right
01:51:42.000 and they're the questions it's the place
01:51:43.360 where you don't want to go versus where
01:51:44.679 you need to go which is you want them to
01:51:47.400 diffuse the bomb in front of you not
01:51:48.800 when they get home right and so you
01:51:50.719 don't want them to sit with the decision
01:51:52.079 you want them to confront it's like you
01:51:53.679 might be wondering this is a lot of
01:51:55.239 money let's talk about it right you
01:51:57.199 might be wondering if your husband's
01:51:58.239 going to be against it well let's talk
01:51:59.320 about some reasons that he might not be
01:52:00.960 against it let's talk about uh what your
01:52:03.560 business partner will say if you buy
01:52:05.000 this without their permission let's talk
01:52:06.679 about that right and so you want to
01:52:09.119 confront those ugly things you don't
01:52:10.440 want to cuz like you're not like if I if
01:52:12.599 you take anything from this the best
01:52:14.840 salespeople want to confront it because
01:52:17.679 they're better at selling them than they
01:52:19.199 are at selling themselves so you want
01:52:21.199 them to confront the obstacle in front
01:52:23.040 of you so that you can help them through
01:52:24.800 it so don't wait for like you're not
01:52:26.880 going to avoid it I promise you you
01:52:28.960 think you're avoiding the landmine but
01:52:30.239 like CU sometimes you hear that thing in
01:52:31.880 the beginning of the call and you're
01:52:32.800 like that's a bit I don't know if I want
01:52:34.679 to blow the CL dude it's going to blow
01:52:35.920 up in the close if you can't even can't
01:52:37.440 even confront it before you've mentioned
01:52:38.960 price it's definitely coming up after
01:52:40.320 you mentioned price so like confront it
01:52:42.320 now so one of my favorite ways to get to
01:52:44.560 the hard question is asking what are you
01:52:46.800 afraid of
01:52:48.440 happening and then I follow that with
01:52:50.719 let's just play it out a lot of times
01:52:52.760 it's like people don't even want to look
01:52:54.679 at what's going to happen it's like no
01:52:56.000 let's play it out right like I remember
01:52:58.360 I had this this sale that happened where
01:53:00.480 I had a lady who was like I follow Dave
01:53:02.199 Ramsey and I have envelopes of cash and
01:53:06.520 if I give you this envelope that's my
01:53:08.199 grocery money for the week uh if I do
01:53:11.159 this program and I was like okay well
01:53:14.639 what are you afraid of and she like
01:53:16.639 paused and I was like is it that you
01:53:17.760 won't be able to afford food I was like
01:53:19.960 would you be afraid of that and she was
01:53:21.840 like well yeah cuz she thought she was
01:53:23.079 going to win the sale day but it was a
01:53:24.199 trap um and I was like but you're trying
01:53:26.679 to lose weight I was like worst case
01:53:27.880 scenario don't afford food you lose some
01:53:29.320 weight I was like when win now I did
01:53:32.040 that with a good tone so she got a laugh
01:53:33.760 out of it right and I was like but let's
01:53:35.400 be real I was like have you ever bought
01:53:36.480 anything in the past that you weren't
01:53:38.280 sure you could afford I was like and
01:53:39.800 where are you now you still survived
01:53:41.360 you're not on the couch right I was like
01:53:43.280 we always make it work in the end right
01:53:44.920 if and you have to you cut somewhere
01:53:46.280 else I was like this is something that's
01:53:47.280 going to last with you forever like you
01:53:48.560 have all these clothes I was like you
01:53:49.719 want to make all of them look better in
01:53:51.400 6 weeks I was like just lose 20 lbs what
01:53:53.560 are you afraid of let's play it out best
01:53:55.800 case worst case when you do that you can
01:53:57.920 basically take away the emotion from the
01:53:59.719 decision and say okay worst case
01:54:01.400 scenario you're on your friend's couch
01:54:03.360 and you know what you were poor before
01:54:05.159 this and you were happy then too so
01:54:06.480 worst case scenario is you're in the
01:54:07.560 same position you've been in before and
01:54:08.639 it was fine best case scenario you
01:54:10.280 change your life
01:54:11.960 forever so does that feel like a bet
01:54:13.800 you're willing to
01:54:15.239 take right and so if you if you just you
01:54:18.000 want to confront it and then walk into
01:54:20.239 what they're afraid of and just say
01:54:21.400 let's play it out so this happens here
01:54:23.440 this happens here best case worst case
01:54:25.800 and I can tell you like I've probably
01:54:27.480 closed more sales on best case worst
01:54:29.159 case than any other close I
01:54:32.599 have ask for the sale again and so this
01:54:35.360 is a big one if you do not ask for the
01:54:37.119 sale you will not get it that is a
01:54:38.360 promise once you ask if you ask again
01:54:40.280 you'll increase the likelihood that they
01:54:41.400 buy now there's a right way to do this
01:54:43.400 and a wrong way to do this if you just
01:54:45.400 ask again when someone says no bad look
01:54:49.000 if someone says no and you ask why and
01:54:51.599 then you resolve the why then you ask
01:54:53.760 again and that makes sense says hey I
01:54:56.760 can't make Tuesdays and you say no
01:54:59.280 worries if we're able to do it on
01:55:00.360 Thursday would that work for you and
01:55:01.520 they say yes they say awesome so you
01:55:02.719 want to move forward you ask again right
01:55:04.880 so all you're doing is resolving the
01:55:06.320 concern there's terms in the industry
01:55:08.040 called looping or you know uh obstacle
01:55:11.719 overcomes whatever whatever wording you
01:55:13.520 want to use is that you resolve the
01:55:15.199 concern and you ask again and you can do
01:55:17.480 this literally unlimited times as long
01:55:19.239 as you resolve the concern and then you
01:55:20.719 ask again I mean Lila will tell you that
01:55:22.679 like if it was either a Sunday sale cuz
01:55:25.119 I usually had way less calls on Sundays
01:55:27.800 um or it was the last appointment of the
01:55:29.880 day for me she just knew that I would
01:55:32.440 always close that sale because I would
01:55:34.480 just have unlimited time because I was
01:55:36.040 like I will just keep going and so I ask
01:55:38.560 again and again and again and I had um I
01:55:41.360 had a partner back in the day I don't
01:55:42.800 know if I like the visual but he's like
01:55:44.159 he's like you're like a pit pull on
01:55:45.320 someone's ankle he's like you just will
01:55:46.719 not [ __ ] let them leave and I was
01:55:48.400 like it's cuz I think I think that they
01:55:49.880 need it they came in cuz they're trying
01:55:51.239 to lose weight we sell weight loss
01:55:53.159 what's the problem like we just have to
01:55:55.560 figure it out and usually it's just like
01:55:57.000 it's mounds of stuff you have to UNP of
01:55:59.520 all these excuses of all the times that
01:56:01.639 they've been unsuccessful in their lives
01:56:03.320 it's like they came in because they want
01:56:04.679 to solve the problem and when then they
01:56:06.079 get confronted with the decision they
01:56:07.520 get freaked out again because they reli
01:56:09.280 this past traumas of the things they've
01:56:11.320 tried and then feeling like a failure
01:56:12.639 and then they associate that failure
01:56:13.760 with you in the moment you're like hey
01:56:14.920 Susan calm down we're just going to have
01:56:16.639 you eat some [ __ ] chicken and walk a
01:56:18.360 little bit it's going to be okay and so
01:56:20.280 the best closers come from the frame of
01:56:22.719 helping the Prospect and so I will tell
01:56:25.199 you this right now the best salespeople
01:56:27.920 care more about the prospect than they
01:56:30.280 do so whoever cares the most about the
01:56:32.119 prospect wins the sale and so if they
01:56:33.679 care more about themselves then they
01:56:35.679 will win now you're like well of course
01:56:36.800 they're going to care more about
01:56:37.800 themselves ah if you have more context
01:56:40.239 than they do which you should because
01:56:41.440 you know more about the product than
01:56:42.560 they do you should be able to have the
01:56:44.360 best perspective to say no I'm not going
01:56:46.560 to let this guy's limiting beliefs get
01:56:47.840 in the way cuz I really want to help him
01:56:49.800 or really want to help her and I can see
01:56:51.639 that today it feels safe to retreat back
01:56:54.320 to not taking action on this huge pain
01:56:56.239 that they have but I can see how this is
01:56:58.360 going to play out cuz I've seen a
01:56:59.360 hundred other people just like them walk
01:57:01.400 out the door and I see them you know a
01:57:03.199 year later and they're the exact same
01:57:04.480 position or worse and I don't want that
01:57:06.239 for them and so if you keep the human at
01:57:08.560 the Forefront of your mind when you're
01:57:09.920 making the sale you'll never come across
01:57:11.880 pushy because you they can hear the
01:57:13.800 intention they can hear the tonality in
01:57:15.119 your voice about you actually just
01:57:16.639 trying to help them so when you ask for
01:57:18.960 the sale again having key stories and
01:57:21.599 metaphors that you can use to break
01:57:23.960 beliefs is what allows you to then ask
01:57:27.199 again and you can do that literally
01:57:28.920 unlimited times as long as they have
01:57:31.000 time and you have time and you address
01:57:32.960 the problem now if you don't address the
01:57:34.159 problem and ask in they go annoy so you
01:57:35.840 just want to make sure that you have an
01:57:37.040 answer and you should have an answer
01:57:38.079 because you've had this conversation
01:57:39.760 before there's nothing they should be
01:57:41.320 able to tell you that should surprise
01:57:42.880 you if we zoom out we have a salesperson
01:57:45.560 who has maximum hours maximum days they
01:57:48.679 have as many time slots per day filled
01:57:51.000 up with the best Prospect effect CU they
01:57:52.679 work them well they have a plan before
01:57:54.840 and after to come prepared to the call
01:57:56.320 and take notes and follow up with them
01:57:58.079 bam famam the whole thing and when
01:58:00.400 they're on the call they're completely
01:58:01.800 present they breathe the script they
01:58:03.280 know how to handle obstacles they have
01:58:05.000 they have analogies and stories and
01:58:06.639 metaphors memorized so they can help
01:58:08.000 people overcome their issues they stick
01:58:09.920 to the script they don't add to the
01:58:11.280 script they keep their word concision as
01:58:13.040 tight as humanly possible so they can
01:58:14.679 maximize the number of sales they have
01:58:15.880 per day and maximize the conversion rate
01:58:17.639 of those sales fundamentally sales by
01:58:19.719 the way I should have defined this
01:58:20.719 earlier is increasing the likely that
01:58:22.520 the prospect buys that's all it is so
01:58:25.719 everything that has to do with sales
01:58:26.800 like if you had the perfect sales
01:58:28.360 process it means you would account for
01:58:29.520 every single variable that could ever
01:58:31.239 happen to any human and you would get
01:58:33.360 100% of people who go through this
01:58:35.079 process to buy that's what a perfect
01:58:37.119 sales process would be and so it's a
01:58:39.040 percentage conversion that's all it is
01:58:41.119 and so with that we have maximum
01:58:43.040 opportunities maximum percentage
01:58:44.199 conversion we have an amazing sales rep
01:58:46.119 but what if they can only do it for a
01:58:47.800 day that gets into the third bucket
01:58:49.639 which is what I would consider meta
01:58:50.679 skills which is traits of the best
01:58:55.800 salespeople the things that most sales
01:58:58.040 people struggle with are trait issues
01:59:00.920 meaning they are on and then they're off
01:59:02.960 again they're on and they're off they
01:59:04.040 get motivated they get demotivated
01:59:05.119 motivated demotivated if you feel like
01:59:06.679 this then it's a skilled deficiency you
01:59:08.800 just don't know how to sustain
01:59:10.000 performance for a long period of time
01:59:11.360 and I promise you the difference between
01:59:12.280 Champions and everyone else is they can
01:59:13.480 sustain performance it's not like I
01:59:15.560 don't know if sales is for me um I don't
01:59:18.440 know if I'm growing enough in my dude
01:59:20.599 here's the cleared deficiencies you
01:59:21.679 can't stay consistent there's some
01:59:22.880 growth that you can tackle right now
01:59:24.560 being consistent another kind of meta
01:59:26.400 skill around this is enthusiasm like
01:59:28.320 they're enthusiastic one week they're
01:59:29.679 not enthusiastic the next week being
01:59:31.400 able to sustain and maintain a high
01:59:33.480 level of enthusiasm for with the role
01:59:34.960 and when you're on the call is a skill
01:59:37.920 it's a skill you whistle while you work
01:59:39.760 you got to learn how to do it you got to
01:59:41.199 learn to like the stuff you don't love
01:59:42.920 so you can do the thing you really love
01:59:44.520 which is
01:59:47.000 sales the best salespeople kill for
01:59:49.360 sport so let me tell you this a little
01:59:50.679 analogy huh notice a little iies so I
01:59:53.159 heard this from uh Mike Ary and I just
01:59:55.239 love this he said there's three types of
01:59:57.079 sales people there's dogs horses and
01:59:58.480 tigers he like dogs you got to feed them
02:00:01.119 and if you don't feed them they starve
02:00:02.320 to death and you got to you got to give
02:00:03.360 them all this attention you got to rub
02:00:04.280 their belly every day and the moment you
02:00:05.360 stop they die horses they will Gallop as
02:00:08.360 long as you keep whipping them but the
02:00:09.599 moment you stop Galloping they just go
02:00:11.280 down to a trot he's like but Tigers he
02:00:14.040 said a tiger can eat a full meal but
02:00:16.199 then if a bunny walks across his line of
02:00:17.840 vision we'll kill the bunny for sport
02:00:20.199 he's like you want tigers and I love
02:00:22.920 that little analogy because the best
02:00:24.199 sales people that I've ever met in my
02:00:25.320 life they love sales they love the
02:00:28.560 thrill of the clothes of the hunt when I
02:00:31.480 was selling weight loss I would
02:00:33.800 sometimes have homeless people and
02:00:34.920 things like that that would come in who
02:00:36.040 would respond to my ads it would happen
02:00:37.760 right I had two ways to take it I could
02:00:39.679 try and not take it seriously try and
02:00:41.520 just like basically just get through the
02:00:42.639 sale so I could move on with my life or
02:00:45.000 I could see it as free practice and
02:00:48.000 what's crazy is the amount of times
02:00:49.480 where I judge someone as poor and turned
02:00:52.040 out that they just dress different I
02:00:53.599 don't know anything about
02:00:55.960 that was more times than I can count and
02:00:58.719 a lot of them were like hey I appreciate
02:01:00.119 you're just like you know Trea me well I
02:01:02.119 was like of course I was like this is a
02:01:03.719 business your money spends the same and
02:01:06.599 so you either practice the skill or you
02:01:09.960 close either way you win it's a lot like
02:01:13.000 lifting weights where if you have your
02:01:14.599 warm-up reps and they look different
02:01:16.440 than your heavy reps you're actually not
02:01:18.400 practicing at all so you're wasting all
02:01:20.400 these opportunities that you could be
02:01:21.639 practic practicing your skill sharpening
02:01:23.520 the sword which is what we call it in
02:01:24.760 the sales world you could be sharpening
02:01:27.119 your sword but you're actually making it
02:01:28.239 duller CU you're practicing the wrong
02:01:30.119 way you're learning bad habits by not
02:01:31.880 taking the sale seriously so the best
02:01:34.719 sales people kill for sport and so I had
02:01:37.560 uh I'll tell you a Jacob story which is
02:01:39.159 my my young my young you know started
02:01:41.639 with me at like 15 and now he's been
02:01:43.000 with me however many years seven he
02:01:44.480 started as a low man on the totem pole
02:01:46.320 and so when we would have lesser
02:01:47.679 qualified leads they handed all of them
02:01:49.719 to Jacob he's like I'll be the garbage
02:01:51.159 man he's like take anybody's leads he's
02:01:52.960 like I just want to get good I just want
02:01:54.040 to practice and so he's trying to take
02:01:55.560 as many reps as he possibly could and
02:01:57.280 guess what happened he started taking
02:01:58.639 more reps than everyone else did and
02:02:00.079 guess what happened after that he got
02:02:01.599 better than other people did cuz he took
02:02:03.000 more reps and he took every one of these
02:02:04.719 as a [ __ ] gift which is what it is is
02:02:06.360 that someone's going to give you the
02:02:07.440 time to learn the skill of sales the
02:02:09.360 business paid for that lead maybe it's
02:02:11.920 less qualified they paid for it just the
02:02:13.719 same and you have the benefit of
02:02:16.320 learning the amount of people who want
02:02:17.560 to learn how to sell better and are
02:02:19.040 unwilling to take quote unqualified
02:02:20.599 leads is ridiculous to me it's free
02:02:22.920 practice with stakes and you still have
02:02:25.159 the possibility of winning and closing a
02:02:29.119 deal track data the best salespeople
02:02:32.719 track data and so they're meticulous
02:02:35.400 about the data they track and so let me
02:02:36.840 explain this so you can judge and I've
02:02:38.880 just seen this across my portfolio the
02:02:40.960 skill of any person in any Endeavor that
02:02:43.480 they practice by the quantity and
02:02:45.719 quality of the metrics they track and so
02:02:47.880 if someone says oh I'm good at sales i'
02:02:49.480 be like cool tell me about the metrics
02:02:50.760 you track now if if they're like ah just
02:02:52.800 you know close rate it's like well
02:02:54.079 there's so many other metrics that you
02:02:55.440 could track to understand how good you
02:02:57.760 are at sales because the close rate is
02:02:59.119 really just an outcome it gives you no
02:03:00.320 leading indicators it tells you nothing
02:03:02.239 else right I want to know what
02:03:04.040 percentage of leads you're booking I
02:03:05.159 want to know what percentage of of
02:03:06.679 scheduled things are showing I want to
02:03:08.199 know of show rate what percentage are
02:03:09.960 you offering of offer how many of you're
02:03:11.840 closing how many how many what's your
02:03:13.920 average call to close are you doing one
02:03:15.320 call two call 1.2 like what's your
02:03:17.239 what's your average number what's your
02:03:18.440 average number of cash collected like
02:03:20.520 there's so many other metrics that you
02:03:21.880 can track to know how well you're doing
02:03:24.239 as a salesperson and yes for everybody
02:03:28.719 like shout this from the rooftops if you
02:03:30.639 can get their schedule rate up by 20%
02:03:32.239 it's just as good as getting their close
02:03:33.760 rate up by 20% and so there's so many
02:03:35.599 other things in the funnel that the best
02:03:37.400 sales people know about closing about
02:03:39.320 how to increase the total number of
02:03:40.639 sales they get by controlling all of the
02:03:43.280 other variables that are under their
02:03:44.480 control now the bad guys the dogs are
02:03:47.599 like I only want these times and I want
02:03:49.840 them to be spoonfed to me and if I don't
02:03:51.800 get them fed there and you don't pat me
02:03:53.360 on the head I'm going to starve to death
02:03:54.880 and die right that's what the dogs do
02:03:57.239 and if you've got sales people like that
02:03:58.599 they're dogs I don't care how many how
02:03:59.960 much experience they have they're dogs
02:04:01.920 right tigers are like I want to be
02:04:03.800 available to kill whenever because I
02:04:06.159 just love the hunt I would do this for
02:04:08.480 free I'm just happy I get paid to do it
02:04:10.440 pro tip if you are somebody who's
02:04:12.239 running a sales team if you want to
02:04:13.840 increase the close rates across the
02:04:15.239 entire team even more give the best
02:04:17.880 closers the best leads and the way you
02:04:20.280 do that is that you have to start by
02:04:21.719 scoring your leads first which means you
02:04:23.320 actually have to track data so you can
02:04:24.840 say these people have the highest
02:04:26.040 likelihood of closing when they have
02:04:27.199 these three characteristics they close
02:04:28.599 at a way higher percentage and then you
02:04:30.159 give those leads to the best guys so
02:04:32.079 fundamentally you'd want the worst leads
02:04:33.559 to go to the worst guy the best leads to
02:04:34.920 go to the best guy and everyone in
02:04:35.960 between and so by doing that you
02:04:38.119 actually match the org and so I actually
02:04:40.119 had a Salesman that I knew who was the
02:04:42.119 top sales rep for a time share business
02:04:44.520 and it's exactly what you think it was
02:04:46.119 so it's a billion dollar plus company
02:04:47.719 this guy was making 3 million a year in
02:04:49.000 commission selling time shares and I had
02:04:51.800 with him and I was like what do you do
02:04:54.520 you know differently and he said well I
02:04:56.119 won the sales competition and so I got
02:04:58.440 one hour with the CEO and on that one
02:05:00.639 hour with the CEO which is the prize for
02:05:02.159 winning the sales competition it was
02:05:03.239 3,000 sales people it was number one he
02:05:05.400 said I just said if you give me the best
02:05:07.679 leads instead of wasting them on these
02:05:08.920 guys who are new he's like I will make
02:05:10.320 you so much money and so the guy
02:05:12.239 experimented with his little Division
02:05:14.840 and he 5x his income as the sales guy
02:05:18.559 and then they took it and they rolled it
02:05:19.920 out Nationwide and they 5X the business
02:05:23.119 and so there's a huge opportunity in
02:05:26.040 every business to give the best closers
02:05:28.119 the best leads because you make more
02:05:30.000 money and what happens is is that the
02:05:33.480 best guys will actually make more and
02:05:34.800 more and more money which then creates a
02:05:36.719 survivorship bias for new guys coming in
02:05:39.480 and so if you know that best guy used to
02:05:42.239 make 200,000 a year as the top closer
02:05:44.480 but now can make 800,000 a year the
02:05:46.559 amount of sales people that you will
02:05:47.679 attract your opportunity will 10x now
02:05:50.639 even though the entry level guys now
02:05:52.400 make less than they did before the
02:05:54.880 opportunity just like the lottery the
02:05:56.280 same reason people buy tickets is they
02:05:57.559 assume that they're going to get there
02:05:59.119 and so by having it this way you'll have
02:06:01.520 people come in willing to make less
02:06:03.119 because they know that if they if they
02:06:04.639 perform well they'll go to the big
02:06:06.920 leagues now the other benefit of this is
02:06:08.840 that you train your new guys on the
02:06:10.960 worst leads so you lose the least money
02:06:13.400 as a business but they also develop
02:06:15.000 their skills because they've got to
02:06:16.000 learn how to Big borrowed steel and
02:06:18.119 squeeze blood from the stones from the
02:06:20.239 least qualified customers and so when
02:06:22.280 they get to somebody who's got a 700
02:06:23.599 credit score and actually has intent to
02:06:25.440 buy they're like oh my God this is
02:06:26.760 amazing because they practiced on
02:06:28.679 somebody who's like missing an arm and
02:06:31.000 missing seven credit cards and they are
02:06:32.800 in bankruptcy and they're actually in
02:06:34.559 the middle of a divorce and the real
02:06:35.800 name isn't Al it's actually Larry and
02:06:38.920 you know it's complicated I'm a little
02:06:40.800 liquid right now I'm between thing you
02:06:43.559 know whatever right and they're closing
02:06:45.559 those people for lunch money uh and so
02:06:48.239 when you learn how to do that when you
02:06:49.639 get to like qualified prospects you're
02:06:50.920 like oh my God this amazing but at that
02:06:52.599 point the business doesn't bear the cost
02:06:54.440 the salesperson does so that they can
02:06:55.800 develop their skills cuz just being
02:06:57.639 real you're still paying them to learn
02:07:00.840 and I'd rather pay as little as I can so
02:07:02.559 I can allocate the resources the best
02:07:04.800 way possible in the
02:07:07.159 business my biggest pet peeve and the
02:07:09.559 reverse of that is my favorite thing
02:07:11.119 about the best salespeople is they never
02:07:13.239 blame circumstances so whenever I have a
02:07:15.559 salesperson is like the leads are bad or
02:07:18.159 you know uh these These people aren't a
02:07:20.800 good fit or just like whatever BS that
02:07:22.960 they can come up with or like I don't
02:07:24.719 like the commission structure we should
02:07:26.320 change
02:07:27.440 like just focus on the things you can
02:07:29.679 control right and the guys that I love
02:07:31.599 the most never complain they pick up the
02:07:34.280 extra shifts they call the leads the
02:07:36.360 most they work them the most they're
02:07:38.320 like these leads are amazing I'm so
02:07:39.960 grateful to have these and be able to
02:07:41.719 practice and get paid to do it and
02:07:44.559 there's a time and a place for giving
02:07:46.159 feedback on stuff group calls not one of
02:07:49.360 them if you are one of these salese you
02:07:51.520 give it oneone with the manager say hey
02:07:53.000 by the way I've noticed like some people
02:07:54.599 get on the phone just objectively like
02:07:56.599 their credit scores are just
02:07:57.559 consistently lower than they were a
02:07:58.599 couple months ago I don't know if we've
02:07:59.639 changed anything on the marketing side
02:08:00.880 I'm going to approach the leads the same
02:08:02.280 I love The Practice just thought might
02:08:04.159 be you know useful data for marketing
02:08:05.840 right that's very different than like
02:08:07.199 dude these leads are [ __ ] I'm I'm not
02:08:08.599 taking these calls right that's just a
02:08:10.599 primadonna and I hate that and so again
02:08:13.480 the worse the leads the better you get
02:08:15.480 the flex your skill and the best sales
02:08:18.000 people take 100% of the control and the
02:08:20.040 best marketers take 100% of the control
02:08:21.599 too and so if everybody is taking
02:08:23.520 absolute blame for every outcome guess
02:08:25.520 what you win we doubled one of our
02:08:27.400 portfolio company sales by tweaking
02:08:29.520 several tiny things in the sales process
02:08:31.599 and you can use all the same tactics in
02:08:33.360 your business too enjoy three young
02:08:35.679 Founders who are all sad because they
02:08:39.360 were not making the amount of money that
02:08:41.320 they wanted to make so before I show you
02:08:43.199 the data let me explain what each of
02:08:44.719 these terms actually mean so show rate
02:08:46.400 is the percentage of people who have an
02:08:48.440 appointment who show up for their
02:08:49.840 appointment so in any business if if you
02:08:51.639 deal with people you will have sessions
02:08:53.559 or appointments you have a time slot
02:08:55.480 that someone says they're going to show
02:08:56.719 up right if it's a sales consult then
02:08:58.320 they are a prospect and they're going to
02:08:59.599 show up to get sold so if I have 100
02:09:01.400 people have an appointment and 70 show
02:09:03.119 up that would be a 70% show rate the
02:09:05.320 second one here is offer rate which we
02:09:07.520 forgot to put in the rate so let me just
02:09:09.000 put that in for you there you go offer
02:09:11.199 rate which is the percentage of people
02:09:12.800 that we actually make an offer to you
02:09:14.440 might be like well why would I not offer
02:09:15.880 everybody well not everyone's qualified
02:09:17.639 and so for example if I work with only
02:09:19.320 gym owners and somebody comes on it's
02:09:20.719 like Oh I'm a personal trainer well you
02:09:21.920 shouldn't be here we had all these other
02:09:23.239 things that said don't be here but you
02:09:24.440 still came why are you here that means
02:09:26.280 that you don't offer them anything and
02:09:27.320 that's it now if 100% of people who
02:09:28.559 showed up show right you are able to
02:09:30.119 offer to then that means that your offer
02:09:31.480 rate would be 100% And that is an
02:09:32.840 indicator of the quality of the lead
02:09:34.599 flow that you have the third is close
02:09:36.639 rate this depends on how you can track
02:09:38.280 this all right so you can either do it
02:09:39.719 based on percentage of people who show
02:09:41.559 or you can do it on percentage of people
02:09:42.920 who are offered what I normally do is
02:09:44.760 I'll just track both I'm going to guess
02:09:46.320 that this one is off of offer rate
02:09:47.520 because it's what we have here it's good
02:09:48.840 to have both stats here because let's
02:09:50.639 say a Sal man wants to artificially
02:09:53.000 increase his close rate well then he
02:09:54.719 will just say well I'm not going to
02:09:56.559 offer anyone unless I know they're going
02:09:57.800 to say yes and so then their close rate
02:09:59.159 is high and then they'll show that
02:10:00.559 there's a really low quality score but
02:10:02.000 if that salesman this is why having team
02:10:03.800 stats is so important and individually
02:10:05.400 is because if the team is all saying
02:10:07.000 that they're offer rate 70 and one guy
02:10:08.480 saying his offer rate's 30 but he has
02:10:09.920 100% close rate and they all have 30%
02:10:11.520 close rates we know where the data went
02:10:13.400 and this is why having high quality data
02:10:15.719 allows you to see what the problems are
02:10:17.239 if I didn't have this percentage then I
02:10:18.760 wouldn't know it's because we have low
02:10:20.159 quality leads or because my salesman
02:10:21.719 suck this data allows me to identify the
02:10:23.920 problem and then fix it so the fourth
02:10:25.360 set here is percentage of cash collected
02:10:27.239 up front meaning if we're selling $1,000
02:10:29.400 widgets and the average cash we collect
02:10:31.920 today is $500 because people do payment
02:10:34.400 plans then we would know our cash
02:10:35.719 collected percentage would be 50% if I
02:10:37.639 have a low close rate but High cash
02:10:39.280 collected percentage that would tell me
02:10:40.840 a different story than a really high
02:10:42.960 close rate and really low cash collected
02:10:44.760 percentage i' be like oh so they're just
02:10:46.119 getting anyone to say yes and taking $10
02:10:49.040 down if they can versus somebody saying
02:10:50.679 we have a hard line and so it's really
02:10:51.960 trying to find the magic between these
02:10:53.400 two and saying how can I get as many
02:10:54.559 people to say yes and get as much cash
02:10:55.800 collected up front the final one here is
02:10:57.360 just unit sold and this is really just
02:10:58.760 the output of these four well if we
02:11:00.199 multiply these things together how many
02:11:01.599 do we end up closing and that's the
02:11:03.000 result so beforehand damn we had a 49%
02:11:07.679 show rate so let's say we have 100
02:11:09.440 appointments now we have 49 who actually
02:11:11.520 show up for their appointment and then
02:11:12.679 of the 49 we're able to offer 83% of
02:11:15.559 them beforehand so 80% of that is 40 40
02:11:18.960 people now are getting offered out of
02:11:20.840 our original 100 appointments of the
02:11:22.520 people who get offered 27% of them which
02:11:25.199 is 10 people roughly are actually buying
02:11:28.440 in that closing percentage and then our
02:11:30.320 cash collected from those 10 people is
02:11:32.239 we're getting a little less than half of
02:11:33.920 the cash that we closed down now I gave
02:11:35.840 you 100 as a number but the actual
02:11:37.639 number of units sold for this business
02:11:39.639 in the prior month was 56 units all
02:11:42.320 right so this is current state if you
02:11:44.800 don't know these numbers in your
02:11:45.920 business you should so that you can
02:11:47.639 improve them let's say I invested in
02:11:49.040 your business today the first thing we
02:11:50.119 want to do is get the data so that so we
02:11:51.400 can see what Baseline is so we can see
02:11:53.320 where the discrepancies are and where we
02:11:55.119 think the biggest opportunities for
02:11:56.320 improvement are and you're going to have
02:11:57.280 to wait till the end of the video I'm
02:11:58.480 going to show you what happened after so
02:11:59.960 let's start with problem number one or
02:12:02.119 opportunity for improvement number one
02:12:03.760 we had a low show rate as in based on
02:12:06.040 our benchmarks of 70% for any kind of
02:12:08.040 appointment type business we think that
02:12:09.639 we should have at least 70 there Allen
02:12:11.199 which was a company that I had all we
02:12:12.760 did was show rates we were doing 4,000
02:12:14.480 appointments a day we experimented we
02:12:16.559 had a machine learning team to think
02:12:18.079 like what was the number of
02:12:19.639 communications that we had to have with
02:12:21.280 a prospect what was the delay between
02:12:23.119 responses that got the most people what
02:12:25.040 were the total number of exchanges how
02:12:27.000 far apart were the exchanges there is
02:12:28.559 lots of data that we were able to
02:12:29.599 collect so their number was 49% of
02:12:31.880 appointments were showing up what we
02:12:33.320 wanted them to be at was 70% this is our
02:12:35.599 Benchmark where we'd say okay this isn't
02:12:37.400 a problem anymore now do we want to
02:12:39.119 improve things absolutely but where are
02:12:40.520 we going to allocate our effort at the
02:12:41.920 constraint this was a constraint now to
02:12:43.880 give context here this Delta is a 40%
02:12:47.800 difference 40% is a lot think about the
02:12:49.719 S&P 500 they're like we trying grow 9% a
02:12:51.800 year it's like boom I unlock that I get
02:12:53.520 40% growth I don't have to do anything
02:12:54.920 else for like 4 years in the S&P big
02:12:56.920 wins that's what we look for lots of
02:12:58.520 things can affect show rate by the way
02:13:00.280 the number one one that affects show
02:13:01.960 rate is number of total time side sa
02:13:03.360 available take that to the bank but one
02:13:04.760 of the other ones is the targeting and
02:13:06.320 the offer itself so targeting is who's
02:13:09.079 actually seeing this promotion if I'm
02:13:11.079 targeting teeny boppers for example I
02:13:13.360 might get people to schedule but then
02:13:16.199 realize that they're not here for a
02:13:17.800 laser hair removal appointment so the
02:13:19.559 targeting there would be off and and so
02:13:21.400 that would affect our show rate and that
02:13:23.000 has nothing to do with our lead nurture
02:13:24.360 sequence or our salesman or anything
02:13:26.000 like that it's just the wrong people
02:13:27.199 were seeing it so that was issue number
02:13:28.639 one for context for us just imagine
02:13:30.559 that's underneath it was 25 to 35y olds
02:13:33.360 who were gainfully employed and love
02:13:34.760 their job and this when we came in to
02:13:36.880 look at it was actually targeting 18 to
02:13:38.559 24y olds the reason that this was far
02:13:40.880 off for us is that the ad objective now
02:13:42.800 I'm going to get a little bit tactical
02:13:43.840 with you ad acis.com at hold Co we have
02:13:46.000 media buyers we have Pros who do this
02:13:48.159 for a living and so when they zoomed in
02:13:50.119 on how their Med a buyer was optimizing
02:13:52.599 the traffic they were optimizing against
02:13:54.159 what a lot of people would initially
02:13:55.520 think they should do which is optimizing
02:13:56.920 for the lowest cost leads and the lowest
02:13:58.599 cost appointments what we had to do we
02:14:00.639 switch to optimize around cost per sale
02:14:03.040 if we can optimize around who we
02:14:04.480 actually sell to we will shift where the
02:14:06.400 sales come from and just to give you how
02:14:07.920 big of a problem this was they had to
02:14:09.360 cancel 75% of their appointments before
02:14:11.920 the 49% show rate the sales guys are
02:14:13.880 spending most of their time just looking
02:14:14.920 at their appointment looking up the
02:14:16.000 person cancelling to get their 49% show
02:14:18.239 rate and that's about the closest thing
02:14:19.599 to literally burning money so second big
02:14:21.760 problem was multitasking and this really
02:14:24.000 goes for any role but especially like
02:14:25.599 sales-driven roles they had a setting
02:14:27.800 team and a closing team and the Setters
02:14:30.280 were both trying to call leads to get
02:14:32.440 appointments and then also nurturing and
02:14:34.360 doing the follow-up to remind them of
02:14:36.079 the appointment and it's similar as that
02:14:37.360 may sound in your mind it's two
02:14:38.520 completely different activities you're
02:14:39.679 banging phones calling people up you're
02:14:41.400 in that flow and then you're like oh
02:14:42.800 wait Sarah has an appointment today let
02:14:44.280 me go REM mind Sarah does Sarah going to
02:14:45.760 interrup it and you're like wait I'm
02:14:46.679 calling and then you start like and it's
02:14:48.199 you go back and forth right so they had
02:14:49.800 three big issues number number one is
02:14:51.599 that they weren't double dialing right
02:14:53.239 which is one of the most common things
02:14:54.320 that you can do by the way if you're
02:14:55.400 doing phone calls because a lot of
02:14:57.159 initial screens will stop the first call
02:14:58.760 but if you dial twice you'll get through
02:15:00.559 number two is that the time to contact
02:15:03.920 was too slow so lead would come in and
02:15:06.199 they would just like sit there for 30
02:15:08.119 minutes 60 minutes an hour 2 hours 3
02:15:10.599 hours right and they weren't getting
02:15:12.199 contacted it's like what did this person
02:15:13.520 do they're like oh I'd like to find out
02:15:14.719 more information nothing and the third
02:15:16.280 thing is that they didn't have the right
02:15:17.599 times to set appointments and they
02:15:18.599 weren't nurturing correctly so we go
02:15:20.639 same day next day I'm just giving you
02:15:22.480 some secrets and they didn't have
02:15:23.800 morning of nurture meaning if you have
02:15:26.800 an appointment today and you booked this
02:15:28.079 appointment 3 days ago if I don't remind
02:15:30.000 you that day that you have an
02:15:31.320 appointment the likely that you show is
02:15:32.760 lower and so these are the problems that
02:15:34.199 they have no double dial slow speed to
02:15:36.320 contact and they didn't have any mning
02:15:38.040 of nurture but wait there's more the
02:15:40.320 second problem they had or opportunity
02:15:42.320 for improvement was that they had a low
02:15:43.840 close rate and this is based on our
02:15:45.599 Benchmark I would normally give you a
02:15:47.159 kpi but it has so many different
02:15:48.920 variables in terms of what percentage
02:15:51.040 close rate is cuz if you're selling in
02:15:52.840 person for example for a low ticket
02:15:54.599 thing you might be able to sell 80% plus
02:15:56.520 of people walking the door on the flip
02:15:58.119 side if you're selling an investment
02:15:59.800 opportunity over the phone on you know a
02:16:02.360 first or second contact you might sell
02:16:04.079 5% but for this particular type of sale
02:16:06.159 that they had which was a two call close
02:16:08.320 for like I would say a mid-priced
02:16:09.480 consumer service in my opinion they
02:16:11.159 should have been about 40% so 40% is
02:16:13.159 what I wanted them to be at and then
02:16:15.000 current was 27% so this is where they
02:16:17.679 were this is where we wanted them to be
02:16:19.480 and again for context here this is about
02:16:21.760 a 50% Improvement so problem number one
02:16:23.960 is that they had service level Discovery
02:16:25.639 if you're not familiar with that
02:16:26.440 terminology in a sales script there's
02:16:28.040 different kind of phases that you go
02:16:29.440 through in a conversation and the
02:16:31.000 opening part is often a little bit of
02:16:32.679 Rapport and then right after that you
02:16:33.760 get into Discovery and Discovery is
02:16:35.080 where you're discovering what the
02:16:36.920 problems that the person's going through
02:16:38.080 you're trying to understand why they are
02:16:40.359 where they are why they're on the phone
02:16:41.718 with you why they decided to take time
02:16:43.280 out of their day why this problem is
02:16:44.879 important to them what they've tried in
02:16:45.920 the past etc etc right this is the
02:16:47.879 Discovery this gives you all the
02:16:49.280 ammunition that you're going to use at
02:16:50.519 the end of the sale to close it so the
02:16:52.558 way that they were doing was simply
02:16:53.679 saying how much money do you want to
02:16:54.959 make just asking the one question which
02:16:57.318 is the big obvious question it's surface
02:16:59.240 level but the big thing that you always
02:17:00.718 want to ask when you're selling is
02:17:02.000 intention why do they want this like
02:17:04.318 what changes as a result of this how
02:17:06.318 will your life look different what can
02:17:07.638 you not do now that you would be able to
02:17:09.240 do as a result of this change who else
02:17:11.080 in that in your life would that affect
02:17:12.679 why does that matter to you right and so
02:17:14.160 these are all why questions and it's to
02:17:16.080 to dig up their intentions because if
02:17:18.478 you can understand why someone's there
02:17:20.080 it's much easier to get them to agree to
02:17:22.439 getting them there right but if you
02:17:23.959 don't know that someone's trying to
02:17:25.638 let's say replace their income versus
02:17:28.519 quit their job versus just have side
02:17:31.280 hustle money those are very different
02:17:32.879 intentions if I want to talk to side
02:17:34.439 hustle money I'm probably not going to
02:17:35.840 be like this is going to take a ton of
02:17:37.638 time on the flip side if someone's like
02:17:39.599 I hate my job I just want to do
02:17:41.519 something that's not this then I might
02:17:43.240 talk about what the day-to-day looks
02:17:45.040 like in this scenario and ask them if
02:17:46.599 that sounds better to them so if you
02:17:47.920 think about sales process
02:17:51.318 what they were doing is they were asking
02:17:53.120 questions that were here surface level
02:17:56.280 but this is where all the meat is and
02:17:58.240 that's where all the money is is the
02:17:59.638 questions that are below the surface is
02:18:01.599 understanding why someone's even doing
02:18:02.760 this to begin with look at that Iceberg
02:18:04.398 killer Iceberg and so the second issue
02:18:06.359 is that they had a lot of objections
02:18:07.959 coming up on the call I'll say
02:18:09.478 objections but I also mean obstacles for
02:18:11.200 those of you who are sales sales senses
02:18:13.920 objections happen after you talk about
02:18:15.679 the number obstacles happen before you
02:18:17.519 talk about the number if you come on the
02:18:18.760 phone and I say hey why are you here and
02:18:20.040 you're like I just want to find more
02:18:21.040 information that's actually an obstacle
02:18:22.478 like you already have to confront that
02:18:23.679 cuz like no you're not hopping on phone
02:18:24.760 calls all day trying to find information
02:18:26.359 what problem you trying to solve and
02:18:27.478 then they're like well and then you get
02:18:28.760 into it right but if you don't address
02:18:29.799 that up front it'll blow up on you in
02:18:31.318 the clothes so objections and obstacles
02:18:33.879 is what they were encountering a lot of
02:18:35.240 and part of that is because they
02:18:36.879 Discovery was wrong right they were
02:18:38.000 talking to service levels so then lots
02:18:39.558 of [ __ ] was blowing up on them in the
02:18:41.000 close common objections that happen
02:18:42.840 after you present price is uh this is
02:18:44.920 too much I need to think about it I have
02:18:46.599 to talk to my spouse I'm not sure if
02:18:48.240 this is for me I'd like to get more data
02:18:49.879 can you send me a brochure like these
02:18:51.439 are all just the make believe things
02:18:52.840 that people will say in order to not buy
02:18:54.840 from you interestingly a lot of times if
02:18:56.840 you stay in the surface level they'll
02:18:58.160 even give you what we call Smoke screens
02:18:59.679 but basically like they'll just come up
02:19:01.478 with uh a reason that they're not going
02:19:02.920 to do it and it's not even the reason
02:19:04.398 they just throw a smoke bomb up and
02:19:06.200 they're like I don't like English you
02:19:08.200 know walk away right has nothing to do
02:19:09.519 with it they just want to get off the
02:19:10.359 phone so those are the two issues that
02:19:11.760 we had on the sales and that was getting
02:19:13.718 us to this 27% close rate and what this
02:19:16.799 looks like is lots of argumentation and
02:19:19.519 like hard closing and it's because the
02:19:21.558 sale isn't positioned properly and they
02:19:24.359 were basically talking at people and not
02:19:26.478 listening if the salesperson is talking
02:19:28.478 more than the prospect in your sales
02:19:30.240 like these are likely issues that are
02:19:32.000 coming up I'm going to give you two
02:19:33.318 examples real quick to show you how
02:19:35.200 important delivery of a messages so if I
02:19:37.879 say I have to think about it and I say
02:19:39.718 oh like what are your main concerns or
02:19:41.439 what are the main like what are the main
02:19:42.478 variables that you're considering you're
02:19:43.840 not thinking wow this guy's a douchebag
02:19:46.040 I sound like I just genuinely want to
02:19:47.638 know I call it childlike curiosity I
02:19:49.640 always cue it by tilting my head I'm
02:19:51.319 like huh what are the main things and I
02:19:52.920 would increase my voice at the end there
02:19:54.840 an improperly trained salesp person
02:19:56.280 might be like well what are the main
02:19:57.560 concerns you have and all of a sudden
02:19:58.880 that sounds like a very different thing
02:20:00.000 so they're saying the script but they're
02:20:01.439 not but the prospect isn't hearing the
02:20:02.960 same message and these are little
02:20:04.319 details that actually can make a huge
02:20:05.720 difference in ultimately how you close
02:20:07.439 there's a lot of things in tone but I'll
02:20:08.880 just say one is how you raise or lower
02:20:11.280 your voice and the second is where you
02:20:12.760 choose to emphasize if I say I didn't
02:20:15.040 say he hit his wife if I say like that I
02:20:17.240 have neutral Tone If I say I didn't say
02:20:19.120 he hit his wife then it's like I'm not
02:20:21.399 saying that I didn't say he hit his wife
02:20:23.680 is now saying that like those weren't my
02:20:25.399 words I didn't say he hit his wife he's
02:20:27.760 the one to question I didn't say he hit
02:20:29.640 his wife means like he might have done
02:20:30.960 something else but he did something to
02:20:32.200 his wife I didn't say he hit his wife it
02:20:34.359 could have been somebody else's I didn't
02:20:35.760 say he hit his wife it might have been
02:20:37.160 his kid right and so it's the same
02:20:38.880 sentence but simply emphasizing
02:20:40.439 different parts of it communicate
02:20:41.680 different things and so the tone and
02:20:43.920 emphasis create a altogether package of
02:20:46.160 how we communicate and for them their
02:20:47.640 tonality was way off as a team because
02:20:49.560 they were missing the first five minutes
02:20:51.560 of discovering and setting the frame
02:20:52.800 properly and so I'll give you the last
02:20:54.520 set of problems opportunities for
02:20:56.200 improvement and then we'll dive into
02:20:57.359 what we did to solve them and what
02:20:58.359 happened sales problem three opportunity
02:21:01.399 for improvement people in orc structure
02:21:03.800 issues so issue number one is that CEO
02:21:07.439 was the sales manager and that was
02:21:09.720 because he was the best closer he had a
02:21:11.960 significantly higher close rate than the
02:21:13.840 rest of the team but he wasn't a very
02:21:16.040 good sales manager even though he was a
02:21:18.080 good Closer by the way that's one of the
02:21:19.399 main issues that a lot of sales teams
02:21:21.040 have they promote their best closer as a
02:21:22.600 sales manager and often times those are
02:21:24.240 two very different skills and we could
02:21:25.840 see this because the churn on their
02:21:27.960 sales team was through the roof just to
02:21:29.399 be clear like they were a group of young
02:21:31.120 Founders it's not uncommon it's actually
02:21:32.880 probably very common because usually
02:21:35.040 when you start a business learning how
02:21:36.640 to promote and sell the product is
02:21:38.040 usually the job of the founders like how
02:21:39.439 do I get people to want to buy the thing
02:21:40.840 and so they end up getting the most reps
02:21:42.319 early on and also understanding the
02:21:44.120 prospect better than just about anyone
02:21:45.479 and so one of the big things you guys
02:21:47.040 were in a little mini sales last I is
02:21:48.680 that companies will over educate on the
02:21:50.800 product and under educate on the
02:21:52.319 prospect the person that you should be
02:21:53.880 educating your sales stuff on is who
02:21:55.240 we're talking to more than what we're
02:21:57.160 selling cuz for me if I know someone
02:21:59.520 deep in their core what their intentions
02:22:01.160 are I can tell them anything I know
02:22:02.880 someone inside and out and then someone
02:22:04.600 says sell this thing and I know nothing
02:22:06.439 about it I could probably get them to
02:22:07.840 buy on the flip side I know everything
02:22:09.319 about this thing and I don't know who
02:22:10.800 I'm talking to talking to a child a man
02:22:12.760 a woman old young different language and
02:22:15.200 so a lot of people talk like hey sell me
02:22:16.680 this pen when in reality what we want to
02:22:18.439 do is like talk to John the majority of
02:22:20.920 good sales trainers who try to do that
02:22:22.960 gimmick what they want the person to do
02:22:25.040 is ask them a question it actually has
02:22:26.680 nothing to do with the pen and so if
02:22:27.880 they say sell me this pen what you do is
02:22:29.479 you take the pen and you put it in your
02:22:30.800 pocket and you say how's it going what
02:22:33.640 brought you in today right cuz I got to
02:22:35.080 go from where they're at to wanting a
02:22:36.600 pen I'm not going to just be like hey
02:22:38.160 buy this pen give me money like it
02:22:39.840 doesn't work that way but bad salesmen
02:22:41.399 do so the second issue was the setting
02:22:43.479 team expectations one of the benefits of
02:22:45.280 working with someone who has more
02:22:46.200 experience is that we know what the
02:22:47.920 Benchmark should be and so a lot of
02:22:49.640 times we can reset some 's minimum
02:22:51.000 standard and they're like well they're
02:22:52.760 setting two a day and we're like they
02:22:53.920 should all be minimum setting three and
02:22:56.399 that sounds tiny but again 2 to three is
02:22:58.760 a 50% increase in sets and that's across
02:23:00.800 a whole team so that means a lot of
02:23:02.680 productivity but if you set the bar low
02:23:04.399 people just naturally shrink down to
02:23:06.359 that level all right so you understand
02:23:07.840 the problems and here is the data this
02:23:10.040 is before they had a low rate issue they
02:23:12.040 had low close rate and multiple issues
02:23:13.359 around that and they had people in
02:23:14.200 organizational issues I want you to
02:23:15.600 pause real quick in the video in the
02:23:17.279 comments to be like what would you do
02:23:18.800 how would you attack these issue if this
02:23:20.600 was your business and then I'll tell you
02:23:22.000 what we
02:23:25.560 did now there's two elements of
02:23:27.600 solutions element one is what would you
02:23:29.640 do to attempt to solve the problem and
02:23:31.279 the second is which one do we do in what
02:23:33.000 order the third problem that was
02:23:34.560 actually the first thing we decided to
02:23:35.880 fix was so we hired a sales director the
02:23:38.359 reason for that was because the CEO was
02:23:40.080 overly involved he was micromanaging he
02:23:41.800 wasn't a good manager and he also wasn't
02:23:43.040 doing CEO stuff and so we had to hire an
02:23:45.080 experienced sales director who in this
02:23:46.640 instance had been a sales trainer for a
02:23:48.279 similar type of sale in a consumer good
02:23:50.240 this guy ended up being exceptional and
02:23:52.359 being able to implement the rest of the
02:23:54.080 changes that we outlined so this was in
02:23:55.880 terms of order of importance I think if
02:23:57.560 we hadn't done this and had tried to do
02:23:58.960 the rest of them it would have fallen
02:24:00.040 flat this is like one of the most common
02:24:02.880 errors that business owners and Founders
02:24:04.880 make is that they see the what and not
02:24:06.479 the who or they focus on the how and not
02:24:08.600 The Who and if you have the same problem
02:24:10.399 that has recurred multiple quarters in a
02:24:12.160 row in the same Department underneath of
02:24:14.479 the same who it might not be a what
02:24:16.279 issue it might be a who issue one of the
02:24:17.960 reasons having experience is help
02:24:20.920 is because you know what it looks like
02:24:22.359 when it's right some of the biggest
02:24:23.600 costs in the business are hiring
02:24:25.120 incorrectly you waste the time trying to
02:24:27.000 find them you waste the time onboarding
02:24:28.560 them and training them and then you
02:24:29.600 waste the time of all the time it takes
02:24:31.399 you to figure out that they're not the
02:24:32.319 right fit and all the loss growth that
02:24:34.479 you would have had to then start that
02:24:36.200 process over again that's tough but a
02:24:38.319 lot of businesses have to deal with that
02:24:39.399 which is why picking Personnel is so
02:24:40.680 important with this instance we looked
02:24:42.720 at culture fit which is like do we think
02:24:44.479 that this guy will fit in which we
02:24:45.720 usually the founders pick that part out
02:24:47.279 like hey does this guy fit in cool and
02:24:48.520 then we're going to hardcore drill on
02:24:50.000 usually experience and tactical
02:24:52.359 knowledge and so we have subject matter
02:24:53.840 experts at holdco media buying cro
02:24:56.279 experts sales experts Finance expert
02:24:58.080 whatever and we will then do tactical
02:25:00.279 interviews we talked about earlier you
02:25:01.960 can know that someone is good based on
02:25:03.880 the quality and quantity of the data
02:25:05.040 that they collect I would ask somebody
02:25:07.080 what data do you plan on collecting and
02:25:08.479 how would you plan on fixing those
02:25:09.520 things based on how vague they are and
02:25:11.439 how high level they go in terms of their
02:25:13.160 Solutions it'll tell you how nuan they
02:25:15.319 can be in their thinking and ultimately
02:25:16.640 executing Solutions sales directors
02:25:18.800 specifically in my experience when I
02:25:21.359 have guys who are like I just want to
02:25:22.720 build up people I want to give these
02:25:24.279 guys skills and they marry that with
02:25:26.240 like and these are the metrics that I
02:25:27.279 track to know X Y and Z that's a good
02:25:29.080 sales director the next thing we decided
02:25:30.960 to solve boom was fixing the ad
02:25:33.319 targeting and the reason we did the
02:25:34.760 sales director first was because we're
02:25:36.880 like well how do we know if anything
02:25:38.160 else is going to happen afterwards if we
02:25:39.760 fix this so what we ended up doing here
02:25:41.880 it turns out is that we also had another
02:25:43.520 Personnel issue the media buyer was
02:25:45.240 asleep at the wheel they were optimizing
02:25:46.680 around the wrong stuff they were trying
02:25:48.040 to split their attention and start their
02:25:49.200 own side hustle it was clear that they
02:25:50.720 were negligent they actually were doing
02:25:52.399 the right thing and then they stopped
02:25:53.880 doing the right thing and it was clear
02:25:55.279 that that type of behavior the founders
02:25:57.120 felt was not going to correct itself so
02:25:58.840 they let go of that person hired a new
02:26:00.720 person and boom fixed the ad targeting
02:26:02.800 problem we were back to 25 to 35y old
02:26:04.439 people who love their job what did we
02:26:05.800 fix next boom We reduced the sales team
02:26:08.880 what and we reset expectations for the
02:26:10.960 setting team what we looked at is sales
02:26:12.560 team utilization if we know that guys
02:26:14.080 can take 10 sales a day and they're
02:26:15.479 actually only taking four then we have
02:26:17.120 too many sales people in this instance
02:26:18.640 it gives you an opportunity to to cut
02:26:20.960 the fat for lack of better term and
02:26:22.319 reward the people who are actually doing
02:26:24.240 their jobs and closing well if you cut
02:26:26.240 the lowest percentage of the team and
02:26:27.520 you have utilization like you have space
02:26:29.800 you lose the lowest closing percentage
02:26:32.200 people and you gain more closes just by
02:26:35.080 Shifting the closing rate overall of the
02:26:37.000 team when you make those changes in my
02:26:39.200 experience sales people get into a
02:26:41.080 rhythm if you don't take enough sales
02:26:42.800 calls you're too desperate to close the
02:26:44.840 deal and then you start being too hard
02:26:47.319 and not listening enough cuz it's about
02:26:48.760 you not them when sales people have more
02:26:50.520 and more consults they sell from the
02:26:52.040 back of their heel they're open-minded
02:26:53.640 they're asking questions they're feeling
02:26:54.960 good and they get in a rhythm the
02:26:56.560 setting team we both downsized and
02:26:58.840 increased expectations how did all these
02:27:00.720 sales increase by having fewer people we
02:27:02.279 had better people that's how and that
02:27:04.000 also helps recreate the culture of the
02:27:05.640 team so that we can have a new standard
02:27:08.439 set of high performers because there's
02:27:10.479 nothing that demotivates a high
02:27:11.800 performer like a low performer who's
02:27:13.080 still on the team and so we went from
02:27:14.600 two to four in terms of our expectation
02:27:17.080 per day for the team in terms of sets
02:27:19.240 sales fix numero qu I'm messing all my
02:27:22.399 columns up now just going to have to
02:27:23.640 deal with it we promoted one Setter to
02:27:25.479 lead nurture specialist I was saying
02:27:26.800 earlier that they were multitasking
02:27:28.279 right so they're doing some setting and
02:27:29.880 they're doing some lead nurture and that
02:27:31.240 gets really hard for a team of six guys
02:27:32.760 to split those things we took one of the
02:27:34.439 Setters who was really good and made
02:27:36.560 that person the lead nurture specialist
02:27:38.080 who basically acted as the bridge for
02:27:39.920 both the setting team and the closing
02:27:41.520 team to basically coordinate and remind
02:27:43.240 the people of their appointments and we
02:27:44.479 equipped that lead nurture specialist
02:27:46.040 with one of our checklists for what that
02:27:47.560 role needs to do to get the most people
02:27:49.600 to show up and I'm not going to give you
02:27:50.840 all because of the long checklist I'll
02:27:51.960 give you two quick examples one of them
02:27:53.359 is doing a three-way intro once you have
02:27:55.160 the set appointment between the setter
02:27:57.160 and the closer and doing it via iPhone
02:27:58.840 if you can because now you have a known
02:28:00.920 person and an unknown person and a
02:28:02.720 person that Bridges the two they might
02:28:04.080 know show on Johnny over here but not on
02:28:06.240 the guy that they just spoke with and so
02:28:07.720 the idea is how can I bridge that Gap
02:28:09.640 and kind of make the association for
02:28:11.120 them add some trust the other thing is
02:28:12.680 that the closers mning of would remind
02:28:15.040 them with either a voice memo or a video
02:28:17.640 text personalized to them being like hey
02:28:19.720 John really excited for our apointment
02:28:21.359 today I saw your profile XYZ
02:28:23.319 personalized to you really pumped for
02:28:24.640 you I think we might help you out so
02:28:25.600 that's just a couple of the things that
02:28:26.560 we have on that list that we had them
02:28:27.840 Implement and all do consistently and
02:28:29.560 sales team fix number five boom is we
02:28:32.880 optimize the sales scripts I said
02:28:34.279 earlier that the discovery was to
02:28:36.120 surface level so we rescripted the
02:28:37.720 discovery made sure we were asking
02:28:38.760 deeper more meaningful questions and a
02:28:40.880 part of that is also bringing some of
02:28:42.240 the objections to the front it's much
02:28:44.240 easier and this is the this is the
02:28:45.600 terminology that our team uses which is
02:28:47.720 killing zombies right it's a lot easier
02:28:49.560 to kill a zombies when it's far away
02:28:50.760 than when it's on top of you if
02:28:51.760 somebody's trying to bring up a zombie
02:28:53.080 in the clothes another way of saying it
02:28:54.680 is like you want to diffuse the bomb
02:28:56.040 before it goes off in the clothes in
02:28:57.439 your face so we solve the problem before
02:28:59.560 we bring it up now this is actually
02:29:01.080 something that we added to this part of
02:29:02.279 the script which is prior to the
02:29:04.000 appointment we say hey is there anyone
02:29:05.479 else who'd be required to make a
02:29:06.760 decision about this thing if they say
02:29:08.399 yes then you say cool well let's push
02:29:10.240 back the appointment and let's get that
02:29:11.399 person on that way you have all the
02:29:13.359 decision makers present so these are
02:29:14.680 just little things but like little 1%
02:29:16.680 improvements over and over over again is
02:29:18.560 what yield these 50% boosts and the
02:29:20.840 third main change we did was that we
02:29:23.200 drilled the team on looping and looping
02:29:25.080 is just a sales terminology for
02:29:27.439 basically when you encounter an
02:29:29.439 objection handling the objection and
02:29:31.760 then asking again handle the objection
02:29:34.319 ask again right because a lot of sales
02:29:36.000 people are afraid to ask if someone says
02:29:37.600 no and they don't want to ask again
02:29:39.000 right and I can tell you this is that
02:29:40.120 the number of sales you make is direct
02:29:41.359 proportional to how many times you ask
02:29:42.880 there's ways to do it wrong and there's
02:29:44.240 ways to do it right the idea is that you
02:29:45.760 should be able to resolve the concern
02:29:47.479 right so if someone says I need to think
02:29:48.840 about it and you say well what are you
02:29:50.080 your main concerns and they say well it
02:29:51.800 seems really complicated you say oh what
02:29:54.240 part specifically feels more complicated
02:29:55.840 they're like it's the whole Tech thing
02:29:57.080 and we're like oh we also have a vendor
02:29:58.800 that can actually fill that in I think
02:30:00.279 it's a couple bucks extra but like we
02:30:01.600 can just handle that for you does that
02:30:03.040 solve the problem and they're like oh
02:30:05.359 okay so you guys will you guys will just
02:30:06.840 handed that one part of it like yeah
02:30:08.000 we'll handed that part of it for you
02:30:09.600 cool now this is where the salesman says
02:30:11.520 great you want to move forward you have
02:30:12.800 your idea on you hey what C you like you
02:30:14.520 can just make the ask right after that
02:30:16.279 and so then at that point you might say
02:30:17.720 ready to move forward then and they
02:30:18.760 might say this feels like a fast
02:30:20.319 decision it's like oh well what makes it
02:30:22.640 fast how long you been thinking about
02:30:23.920 this they're like well I mean I just met
02:30:25.200 you and you say well how long have you
02:30:26.680 wanted to solve this problem and then
02:30:28.160 they would say well I mean a long time
02:30:29.600 it's like well that doesn't sound like a
02:30:30.680 fast decision at all it sounds like
02:30:31.960 you've already made the decision a long
02:30:33.000 time ago that you wanted to change now
02:30:34.279 we're just acting on it so now do you
02:30:36.160 want to move forward right keep looping
02:30:37.640 and continuing to resolve the concern
02:30:39.279 ask again resolve the concern ask again
02:30:41.000 drum roll
02:30:42.200 please what happened in the real world
02:30:45.160 so let's go to the data all right so in
02:30:48.359 our first column we had 49% show rates
02:30:51.479 after we implemented sales fix 2 fixing
02:30:52.960 the ad targeting sales Fix 4 promoted
02:30:55.319 one lead Setter to lead nurture
02:30:56.880 specialist and sales fix 3 reduced the
02:30:59.200 team size and reset expectations survey
02:31:02.880 says we had a 70% boost which is almost
02:31:06.160 exactly the kpi and that's because when
02:31:08.439 you do things that work they work so
02:31:10.160 that was a 40% Improvement in sales and
02:31:12.240 to be clear this was just over 2 months
02:31:14.080 all right so some of these changes going
02:31:15.160 to happen real quick if you know what
02:31:16.240 you're doing the second change we have
02:31:17.760 is our offer rate and so here's what
02:31:19.359 happened so survey
02:31:20.720 says 80% we actually offered just about
02:31:23.399 the same amount of people realistically
02:31:25.040 what they were doing is offering people
02:31:26.120 who weren't qualified cuz the sales team
02:31:27.359 wanted to eat and I get that like
02:31:28.640 there's a human component here they were
02:31:29.960 offering people were not qualified the
02:31:31.439 deal cuz they needed commissions right
02:31:32.840 which is what we were trying to fix with
02:31:33.960 the targeting close rates we went from
02:31:35.600 27% and 60 days later we were
02:31:38.319 at 41% so 1% above our Benchmark all
02:31:42.840 right this is a 50% Improvement in sales
02:31:45.359 so 40 and 50 Kazam next up we have
02:31:48.319 percentage of cash collected a really
02:31:50.040 good metric for knowing how strong the
02:31:51.279 sales team in is and this is especially
02:31:52.840 important for that early Discovery
02:31:54.399 portion and how good they are at looping
02:31:56.040 and closing because the deeper you get
02:31:58.160 the discovery the the more convicted the
02:32:01.000 buyer will be about the solution and the
02:32:03.279 more likely they are to pay up FR as a
02:32:05.920 measure of their conviction in the
02:32:07.319 solution the survey says we went from 47
02:32:09.399 to 82% so we almost doubled the amount
02:32:13.520 of cash that we were collecting up front
02:32:15.880 per sale in 60 days we had a 40%
02:32:18.560 Improvement and we had a 50% Improv and
02:32:20.279 we had a almost doubling of cash
02:32:22.080 collected so if we almost doubled the
02:32:24.880 amount of sales that happened and we
02:32:27.040 almost doubled the cash upfront
02:32:29.000 collected what did we do to the cash FL
02:32:30.319 the business Forex ah much more enticing
02:32:33.720 after we added all these four changes
02:32:35.560 together and we waited 60 days what
02:32:37.520 happened survey says we went from 56 to
02:32:40.640 93 sales a month and that was just from
02:32:43.680 a few of these fixes on one particular
02:32:46.000 part of the organization I taught 116
02:32:49.319 sales Prof professionals my closing
02:32:51.200 framework and after implementing it they
02:32:54.000 increased how much they closed enjoy um
02:32:57.040 Alex Becker who's the who's the founder
02:32:58.560 of that uh clued me in recently to
02:33:01.160 something he's like dude your your your
02:33:02.800 rowes is insane because he can see
02:33:04.399 everyone's revenue and their ad Spin and
02:33:06.600 I was like what do you mean he's like
02:33:08.319 you have the highest return on ad spend
02:33:09.800 of everyone in the entire platform by
02:33:12.279 like a mile and I didn't really ever
02:33:14.560 think about it but our lifetime return
02:33:16.319 on Advertising is 36
02:33:18.120 to1 so to do over you know hund now you
02:33:22.960 know five or 10 million whatever we're
02:33:24.279 at now um we've spent just under $3
02:33:28.240 million in advertising and so there's a
02:33:31.520 lot of other pieces to you know making
02:33:33.479 more but just for everyone on this call
02:33:36.120 we're talking specifically about sales
02:33:39.080 correct yes yeah so so Alex yeah yeah
02:33:42.920 99% of these guys are are
02:33:45.240 closers and they're getting closing
02:33:47.319 positions a couple people are sorting
02:33:48.520 like a closer agency where they partner
02:33:50.240 up with a guy like you and they're like
02:33:51.560 hey let's do like a little JB deal I
02:33:53.240 slam your deals okay sweet well then why
02:33:57.160 don't I so what I'm going to do is
02:33:58.399 because I do have a presentation um
02:34:00.479 which is just how I think about sales um
02:34:03.640 and I have the the third part of the
02:34:05.120 presentation about scaling sales teams
02:34:06.680 does anyone here have multiple closers
02:34:08.120 who work for them or is is most people
02:34:10.880 just closing on your own right
02:34:13.760 now you guys got to talk with Alex he
02:34:16.160 don't bite I also can't see I can't see
02:34:18.479 the chat I can't see the chat
02:34:21.399 we're working towards that
02:34:23.319 Alex okay so how about this I'll give
02:34:26.040 you the things that so um Russell when I
02:34:29.120 first met him was like dude how did you
02:34:30.600 learn how to sell so well and it was
02:34:32.880 because I looked at my CRM and I'd done
02:34:35.080 4,000 sales one-on-one uh in Fitness and
02:34:39.600 so that's a lot of reps you know I was
02:34:42.399 taking 20 consults a day for like four
02:34:44.359 years and so that's in person face to
02:34:46.760 face my team would double or triple book
02:34:48.279 me every 30 minutes and I just sold the
02:34:50.560 same thing over and over again and
02:34:51.680 because I was really good at sales I
02:34:53.680 ended up not hiring a ton of salespeople
02:34:55.600 and I would actually have my manager set
02:34:57.279 appointments for me all at one location
02:34:59.760 so I had six gyms and so I would go
02:35:01.680 there they'd stack up an entire day I'd
02:35:04.000 mow down a whole day go to a different
02:35:06.120 gym and they'd been stacking all the
02:35:07.560 appointments and I'd mow down and so
02:35:09.160 usually I do 20 to 25 consults a day and
02:35:11.960 you just get you you know you just get
02:35:13.479 these reps in of reading people gauging
02:35:15.520 tonality and seeing where you need to
02:35:17.560 lean in and where you need to lean back
02:35:19.439 and so um you know over time I've then
02:35:22.000 started training sales people and sales
02:35:23.640 managers I had a remote sales team we F
02:35:25.720 we'd fly out and do turnarounds um like
02:35:28.439 in person so I had eight guys we'd fly
02:35:30.120 out to eight facilities every month and
02:35:31.800 we turn these facilities around because
02:35:33.399 I know Mike you were in the Fitness
02:35:34.319 World before this um that's right and
02:35:36.920 then I brought that sales team in-house
02:35:38.439 and they started doing phone sales for
02:35:39.760 high ticket so I've had um I've had
02:35:41.920 in-person phone High ticket low ticket
02:35:44.359 we've kind of done a lot of those things
02:35:45.920 I trained mortgage leads teams um so
02:35:48.120 kind of the whole Gambit and there's
02:35:50.000 definitely some things that I've seen
02:35:51.399 you know I've bought every sales product
02:35:53.160 on the market I bought Grant stuff
02:35:54.399 bought bford stuff um and I think
02:35:56.880 there's a lot of Merit and there's a lot
02:35:58.120 of good stuff out there but in my
02:36:00.160 experience uh Simplicity is what scales
02:36:03.240 and so I'll give you if you're okay with
02:36:05.120 it I'll give you the few things that I
02:36:08.000 have implemented consistently within my
02:36:09.960 companies that have generated outsize
02:36:11.640 returns is that cool all right awesome
02:36:15.600 what I'm Gonna Roll let get all right
02:36:20.800 full Jam so as I said Simplicity right
02:36:23.960 I'm a the world's best graphic designer
02:36:26.840 uh as you can see here so I'm trying to

02:36:53.880 you guys to uh grow your thing in the
02:36:55.720 past I promise you it's not your fault
02:36:56.920 lots of information very confusing um
02:36:59.840 and you can sometimes be inundated with
02:37:03.000 lots of different sales people's
02:37:04.080 information you've got Mike here who's a
02:37:05.640 who's a gem and knows his [ __ ] and you

02:37:15.800 and become the salesp person I want what
02:37:16.960 if I never hit the 100 100 Grand a year
02:37:18.640 what if I never hit the 100 Grand a
02:37:19.760 month or whatever don't hit the million
02:37:21.160 a month goal that I have and then what
02:37:23.279 does that what does that mean about me
02:37:24.520 right if you've ever thought those
02:37:25.560 things um like I can tell you I did two
02:37:28.680 um right after the instance that I had
02:37:30.520 uh mic with that individual um and that
02:37:32.640 individual drained my entire bank
02:37:34.080 account and then sent it to their
02:37:35.200 girlfriend in Sweden and then filed
02:37:36.800 bankruptcy after that happened I had
02:37:39.040 $1,200 because I had sold all my gyms
02:37:41.160 and put my money into that account so I
02:37:43.120 started at zero which I'm very grateful
02:37:44.920 for because it gave me the experience
02:37:46.600 that I have now and so what I'm going to
02:37:48.680 show you is that you can have a simple
02:37:50.359 sales process that can yield outsid
02:37:52.240 returns a lot of people like to make
02:37:53.640 this fancy because it makes it easier to
02:37:55.520 sell stuff to people about selling but
02:37:58.279 these are the things that I have seen
02:37:59.399 that have unlocked the growth for us
02:38:01.359 because I don't think I'm the best
02:38:02.520 marketer out there I think we've simply
02:38:04.359 attached a phone to a funnel um and
02:38:06.439 we've been very efficient at it and so
02:38:08.960 as a result of that I've always been
02:38:10.240 able to make more per customer than
02:38:11.840 anyone else because of how efficient we
02:38:14.120 are at the conversion process all right
02:38:15.720 and so that's what we're here for so I
02:38:17.399 want to show you exactly step by step
02:38:18.840 our process for selling all right and so
02:38:21.120 there should be two types of people here
02:38:22.880 some of you guys who are under $100,000
02:38:24.479 a month and I'll show you how to never
02:38:25.880 compete on price again all right and if
02:38:27.800 you guys are over $100,000 a month I'll
02:38:29.399 show you exactly what we did to scale a
02:38:30.920 team to get to a million a month and
02:38:32.240 Beyond is that cool because if you're
02:38:34.200 under a 100 it's just you right if
02:38:36.000 you're over a 100 you need people all
02:38:37.600 right so it's gonna kind of be like the
02:38:39.359 actual sing itself and then the scaling
02:38:41.279 of the sales all right so that's kind of
02:38:43.240 the goal for the 60 minutes I'll
02:38:44.479 probably be able to get it done in 40ish
02:38:46.319 I'll talk fast so we can have some time
02:38:48.240 all right everyone can just listen fast
02:38:49.840 is that all right all right
02:38:52.120 I'm
02:38:53.640 it so I've been really fortunate um yeah
02:38:56.359 now we're at 105 or 110 or whatever it
02:38:58.399 is um in in selling stuff which has been
02:39:00.680 cool what's been coolers we've been able
02:39:02.359 to donate to causes you guys don't know
02:39:04.080 my story but um I had a I had a gym
02:39:06.800 teacher after school who stayed with me
02:39:08.479 he didn't have to he didn't know me from
02:39:09.840 anybody and he worked out with me for an
02:39:11.840 entire year and taught me how to work
02:39:13.080 out because I was like a really insecure
02:39:14.520 kid and as a result of that I got into
02:39:16.680 fitness and so I feel like it's all of
02:39:18.520 our opportunity because you guys are on
02:39:19.880 here like we're already in the top 1% in
02:39:22.240 the world you know what I mean like
02:39:23.760 we're bitching about not making 100
02:39:25.240 Grand a month like [ __ ] you you know
02:39:27.680 what I mean like really and so um it's
02:39:30.680 been a great privilege to be able to
02:39:31.760 give back you we've donated 1.4 million
02:39:33.840 just in the last three years actually
02:39:35.120 1.7 now I have to update that um but
02:39:37.640 anyways just the causes that we that we
02:39:39.040 care about and so for us it's it's kids
02:39:40.880 being able to have the opportunity that
02:39:41.920 we had all right and uh if you guys are
02:39:44.000 in the fitness industry Arnold was my
02:39:45.359 hero is the reason I quit my job um and
02:39:47.319 I've been able to you know grow a
02:39:48.439 friendship with him which is been
02:39:49.600 awesome um and we've had you know over a
02:39:52.319 thousand clients hit $100,000 a year
02:39:53.960 using the sales framework I'm going to
02:39:55.120 show you all right so like you can
02:39:57.359 imagine that these people are not maybe
02:40:00.240 as good as you are you can imagine that
02:40:02.399 somebody in that thousand is probably
02:40:03.680 not as naturally talented right so the
02:40:05.760 process works okay and we've got a lot
02:40:07.920 of people over seven figures now um but
02:40:10.160 it wasn't that way right so this is me
02:40:11.399 when I started my first gym I slept on
02:40:13.399 the floor I had $5,000 total my rent was
02:40:16.279 $5,000 um and so I had one month that I
02:40:18.319 had to learn how to make money
02:40:20.000 and uh I built a funnel because I
02:40:22.479 learned this from the internet and I was
02:40:23.840 actually I sent this picture to my dad
02:40:25.200 because I was so excited I was so proud
02:40:27.600 of this picture because I sold that many
02:40:29.200 people in the first in the first two
02:40:30.760 weeks uh for
02:40:33.279 free um and things started to grow right
02:40:35.560 I my that was my one of my gyms I had
02:40:37.279 nine employees I felt like a badass you
02:40:39.680 know my dad finally told me he thought I
02:40:41.240 you know wasn't a schmuck for you know
02:40:43.200 being an idiot and getting into fitness
02:40:44.600 so I thought I felt like I was figuring
02:40:45.720 things out and then all of a sudden
02:40:47.960 Facebook slap happened this is years ago
02:40:49.680 and there's been many slaps Facebook
02:40:51.000 just kind of kind of has its it its
02:40:52.680 [ __ ] hand proverbially swinging back
02:40:54.439 and forth but um you know we got slapped
02:40:56.800 and overnight my my lead cost went up 5x
02:40:58.880 right and so my my money my moneymaking
02:41:00.720 rain turned into a desert and the thing
02:41:03.080 was my marketing was losing money every
02:41:04.439 day and all I could think about was
02:41:05.960 letting my dad down and more
02:41:07.319 realistically having my dad be right I'm
02:41:10.359 gonna I'm gonna all right cool um and so
02:41:13.680 the question that I asked myself was
02:41:14.640 like how can I afford to get more leads
02:41:16.120 right and so I called on my friends up
02:41:17.840 and he had a he was a brick and mortar
02:41:19.439 gym owner and he told me that things
02:41:20.960 were going great for him and I was like
02:41:22.439 what the hell dude what are you what are
02:41:23.800 you doing he was like dude we just we
02:41:25.279 just attached the phone to the funnel
02:41:26.800 and I was like no [ __ ] he's like we're
02:41:28.439 selling expensive stuff on the front end
02:41:29.840 now instead of selling trials I was like
02:41:31.920 well that's cool I'll do that and so we
02:41:33.880 went from losing two and a half two to
02:41:35.160 one to making 10 to one return on the
02:41:36.720 front end right and what that meant for
02:41:38.439 my business is I went from being able to
02:41:39.920 break even at $10 a lead to being able
02:41:42.000 to spend up A1 $100 a lead and still
02:41:44.080 make money which is crazy right and so
02:41:46.319 then things started to grow again for me
02:41:48.120 and then we you know open location after
02:41:49.840 location and things grow and I met this
02:41:51.960 guy and uh I was I was I met I joined
02:41:54.840 his Mastermind I was trying to I told
02:41:56.160 him I wanted to create a nationwide gym
02:41:57.640 gym chain and he said uh you should
02:41:59.520 teach other people how you do what you
02:42:01.040 do and not grow that chain and I was
02:42:03.000 like well you make more money than me so
02:42:04.960 okay I'll listen and so then I started
02:42:07.040 making uh our doing our Marketing System
02:42:09.240 Mike this is by the way at that guy's
02:42:10.600 gym um did 191 signups in 19 days and
02:42:13.800 that was the stack of contracts um some
02:42:16.120 of you guys may have seen this it was
02:42:17.200 like the most run ad for like a year and
02:42:18.720 a half
02:42:19.680 um but we did I know $100,000 in in 19
02:42:22.520 days in sales like in the ghetto all
02:42:23.920 right so these are the three Frameworks
02:42:25.920 sorry I sped through that because we
02:42:27.160 already covered a little bit of my story
02:42:28.240 early so I wanted to get through it um
02:42:30.600 and these are the free Frameworks that I
02:42:31.680 kind of discovered um to scale High
02:42:33.200 ticket all right and it'll take if you
02:42:35.399 if you're if you're partnering some with
02:42:36.880 someone then it'll help take their
02:42:38.319 losing funnels and turn them into into
02:42:39.800 cash machines and I mean that genuinely
02:42:41.800 all right so the free three Frameworks
02:42:43.840 that I do is one is the closure
02:42:45.279 framework all right these are the
02:42:46.240 questions that get prospects to say yes
02:42:48.439 all right and so adding this to any kind
02:42:49.880 of any funnel process is going to
02:42:51.479 instantly make it more profitable all
02:42:53.080 right and I'm going to walk through the
02:42:54.279 questions that we ask and specifically
02:42:56.160 what only three things that you can say
02:42:57.479 on a sales call period it's the number
02:42:59.279 one mistake that all the sales guys that
02:43:00.800 even my guys make and I have to remind
02:43:02.720 them up all right the second thing is
02:43:04.319 the conviction framework so anyone who
02:43:05.720 believes can outperform a seasoned sales
02:43:07.600 rep by simply learning control their
02:43:08.840 tone all right so some of you guys right
02:43:10.600 now can I get a hand um I'm gonna
02:43:12.520 unshare my screen real quick can I get
02:43:14.000 hands on the screen of who here is newer
02:43:16.160 to this newer to high ticket sales okay
02:43:18.920 great great perfect then this is for you
02:43:22.319 I'm going to show you how you can beat
02:43:23.479 the best sales reps all right and this
02:43:25.359 is how I never ever hire seasoned
02:43:27.800 closers just FYI no no mik we're goodna
02:43:31.439 TR trading sales people I
02:43:33.399 don't um but I'm gonna show you how you
02:43:35.680 can beat seasoned prep seasoned Pros all
02:43:38.120 right which if I can find my
02:43:40.760 presentation there we go um by learning
02:43:43.880 control your tone and the last one is
02:43:46.040 scaling so for all you guys who are over
02:43:47.600 $100,000 a month and need to scale a
02:43:49.680 team I'm going to show you how to
02:43:50.720 duplicate the skill in other people all
02:43:52.760 right because it's one level of the
02:43:54.000 skill is learning to sell another level
02:43:56.319 of the skill is teaching to sell and
02:43:58.520 it's a more valuable skill so if you can
02:44:00.520 duplicate your skill in someone else
02:44:03.080 that is how you can make 10 times 100
02:44:05.120 times more money because it's no longer
02:44:06.920 you're no longer constrained by your
02:44:08.399 time all right so let's rock and roll
02:44:10.479 close your framework so after pouring
02:44:13.240 over like hundreds of scripts like I
02:44:14.800 mean it hundreds of scripts um I
02:44:17.080 realized that there was always like
02:44:18.479 these minor in wording but if I hit
02:44:20.920 these kind of main Milestones along the
02:44:22.560 way I ended up closing the sale right
02:44:25.200 and the nice thing is that this process
02:44:26.680 works for B Toc and B2B so I don't know
02:44:28.760 what stuff you're selling but it works
02:44:30.120 for both and it worked for $500 tickets
02:44:32.359 as much as $100,000 tickets the process
02:44:34.240 is the same right and the way I teach my
02:44:36.600 sales teams and now thousands of clients
02:44:38.840 is This Acronym right and like even when
02:44:41.000 I'm thinking through sales calls we use
02:44:42.520 we like closer C right l so the C is
02:44:45.840 clarify why the person is on the phone
02:44:47.720 with you right that's the the objective
02:44:49.800 why are you here why' you take the time
02:44:51.319 to take the call what's the problem
02:44:54.279 right what are we trying to solve here
02:44:56.640 after that then we're like got it so
02:44:58.560 what I'm hearing is you're struggling
02:45:00.240 with this does that sound about right
02:45:01.760 I'm going to label you with a problem
02:45:04.240 after that we overview their past pain
02:45:06.720 it's like okay so you have this problem
02:45:08.040 I can't be the first person you've
02:45:09.120 talked to about this tell me a little
02:45:10.279 bit about what you've done so far to try
02:45:11.720 to try and get past this right tell me
02:45:13.960 more about that how'd that work out for
02:45:15.600 you okay understood after that it's like
02:45:18.600 okay so hearing all these things this is
02:45:20.760 why you're here this is what you're
02:45:21.840 trying to get this is what you've tried
02:45:23.080 and hasn't worked okay well can I tell
02:45:25.279 you about how I think we might be able
02:45:26.200 to solve your problem this is where we
02:45:27.720 sell the vacation right and then finally
02:45:30.560 or step before finally we explain away
02:45:32.560 their concerned so this is where we tell
02:45:34.200 them about the program and then we're
02:45:35.439 like do you want to do it they say yes
02:45:37.600 or no if they say no then we explain
02:45:40.080 away their concerns so they say yes and
02:45:41.880 then once they say yes we reinforce the
02:45:44.120 decision and this last R here is a point
02:45:46.319 that I added years later because we
02:45:48.319 realize that
02:45:49.800 the sale the sale just continues
02:45:52.479 throughout the entire customer
02:45:53.640 relationship right and so for you guys
02:45:55.439 if you're dealing with clients uh who
02:45:57.720 you're selling for you have to also sell
02:45:59.800 them on continuously selling right you
02:46:01.880 might have closed the card or closed the
02:46:03.520 first payment but they're onboarding
02:46:05.319 experience they got to close them again
02:46:07.439 and then after that when they have their
02:46:08.640 first week check-in call they got to get
02:46:10.200 closed again because we have to
02:46:11.319 consistently sell them on why they
02:46:13.120 should do anything why should they not
02:46:14.720 just watch Netflix why should they why
02:46:16.240 should they take action why should they
02:46:17.359 have the discomfort of getting you know
02:46:19.040 smacked on the phone by a stranger right
02:46:21.000 why should they why should they feel the
02:46:22.600 The Sting of failure we have to sell
02:46:24.399 them consistently to help them overcome
02:46:26.319 their pains right and so I'll show you
02:46:28.359 each some of these more closely so
02:46:30.240 clarifying why they're there right it's
02:46:31.640 like what made you come in today what
02:46:32.840 made you reach out what's your goal
02:46:34.160 right now why is that important to you
02:46:35.960 right okay helping me understand what
02:46:37.880 what you what are we doing here right
02:46:39.720 this is one where someone in the
02:46:40.840 beginning like you have to hit this
02:46:42.800 because if someone says like you I just
02:46:44.120 wanted to find out more information
02:46:45.560 you're like cool but why like what did
02:46:48.200 you want the information to solve what
02:46:49.760 was the like I'm sure you don't just go
02:46:51.359 around collecting information all day
02:46:52.720 right like there's something you're
02:46:53.439 trying to get out of this what's the
02:46:55.399 problem and then and then you get what
02:46:57.760 you need you're like got it okay so just
02:47:00.000 so I'm hearing you right it sounds like
02:47:01.520 this is your goal correct then they
02:47:03.479 acknowledge they have a problem this is
02:47:04.920 important because they have to say it
02:47:06.960 they have to own it I can't cure cancer
02:47:08.920 until you admit that you have it right
02:47:10.800 we got to give it to you before we can
02:47:12.040 cure it after that we overview the past
02:47:14.720 right so it's like what have you tried
02:47:15.720 so far to accomplish this how long did
02:47:17.479 you do it for how long long ago how did
02:47:20.000 that work for you what else have you
02:47:21.520 tried we call this the pain cycle right
02:47:23.840 we consistently do this over and over
02:47:25.640 again so we've exhausted all options
02:47:27.279 right at that point we have tons of ammo
02:47:29.000 that we can use later in the clo which
02:47:30.319 I'm sure you're aware of right and the
02:47:32.279 big piece here is we explain how it's
02:47:33.600 not their fault because if they had this
02:47:35.600 missing piece or two of the equation
02:47:37.720 they were halfway there they were three4
02:47:39.479 the way there they were just missing
02:47:40.760 this one piece which we're going to
02:47:41.800 provide for them right and the nice
02:47:43.680 thing is is for most of you hopefully
02:47:45.120 you're selling a a holistic solution
02:47:47.920 right so for example I'm G to use a
02:47:49.640 fitness example because Mike's from from
02:47:51.040 that background too if someone came in
02:47:52.640 and said they tried workouts in the past
02:47:54.439 I'm be like I'm not telling you don't
02:47:56.160 that you don't need to workout it's
02:47:57.080 great but you also need the nutrition
02:47:58.479 and the accountability right you need
02:47:59.960 nutrition to make sure they stop eating
02:48:01.040 [ __ ] because if you just start working
02:48:01.840 out eating Donuts it's not going to work
02:48:03.240 right of course now if I make you the
02:48:04.840 best plan in the world but you don't
02:48:05.720 follow it's not going to work either
02:48:06.760 that's why you need the accountability
02:48:07.680 and that's what I'm here for and so from
02:48:09.240 that point that's kind of how you can
02:48:10.479 naturally transition so it's like I'm
02:48:11.800 hearing these things this is what you're
02:48:13.160 missing well do you want to hear how the
02:48:14.640 program works because I think we might
02:48:16.680 be able to solve that for you they'll
02:48:17.760 say yes all so what we've seen is that
02:48:19.600 there's three things that make clients
02:48:21.080 successful right and at this point this
02:48:23.439 is my belief is that three things has
02:48:25.399 been you know unequivocal and most
02:48:27.040 pitches is that I think it's human brain
02:48:28.600 is that you can't take more than three
02:48:30.479 but typically it's like three pillars to
02:48:32.920 the to the stool or three you know
02:48:34.760 finish and accountability if I was
02:48:36.200 selling leads I'd want them to be you
02:48:38.040 know timely uh you know qualified and
02:48:42.439 you know uh exclusive right there'll be
02:48:44.960 three elements to make what makes a good
02:48:46.920 lead right there's there's always three
02:48:48.359 that you can usually find when you're
02:48:49.960 selling a solution and most times not
02:48:52.800 most times every time if you're on the
02:48:55.399 phone with the prospect you always have
02:48:57.120 the upper hand because they have
02:48:58.240 admitted at the beginning of this phone
02:48:59.560 call that they have a problem they have
02:49:01.560 not solved it and so inherently they're
02:49:03.640 going to be missing one of the keys they
02:49:05.040 cannot have them all or they would not
02:49:06.200 be on the phone so you have a you you
02:49:08.240 you are in in an unlosable situation
02:49:10.800 unless you choose to lose it right
02:49:12.399 unless you choose to lose the frame and
02:49:14.240 so in this instance it has been my
02:49:16.399 experience that we use stories short
02:49:18.680 short anecdotal stories to to to break
02:49:21.479 the belief of the prospect around a
02:49:23.319 topic what's important here is that we
02:49:25.200 don't get into uh jargon right we don't
02:49:28.120 get into technobabble and talking about
02:49:30.880 the program and the modules and the the
02:49:34.960 things they're going to do because all
02:49:36.439 of that sounds like work and that's not
02:49:39.720 what they're there for they're there for
02:49:40.880 a result right and so instead I would
02:49:44.520 say something like with the Fitness
02:49:46.120 Nutrition accountability like I said
02:49:47.200 earlier so if I was trying to explain
02:49:48.680 accountability be like listen you don't
02:49:50.040 have accountability when you were a kid
02:49:52.000 you ever like have your parents tell you
02:49:53.239 to brush your teeth they were like yeah
02:49:55.080 like you know how you're like I don't
02:49:56.200 want to I don't want to and they would
02:49:57.239 tell you oh no you got to go brush your
02:49:58.439 teeth and and you go and you brush your
02:49:59.720 teeth and you sulk back to bed and next
02:50:01.479 night you do the same thing they tell
02:50:02.600 you brush your teeth you go brush your
02:50:03.520 teeth go back to bed but you're an adult
02:50:05.800 now right you brush your teeth they're
02:50:07.560 like yeah and that's because you had
02:50:09.319 external accountability that turned into
02:50:11.239 an internal habit right and that's what
02:50:13.279 we're going to do for you here right so
02:50:14.640 I didn't tell them about [ __ ] the
02:50:16.760 coaching call that they're going to have
02:50:18.080 and the post that they're going to have
02:50:19.359 and the blah blah blah we told them as
02:50:21.239 the result of that we gave them an
02:50:22.640 anecdotal story that made sense to them
02:50:24.560 for that's probably a really key point I
02:50:26.040 just want to drive home ear out when you
02:50:27.279 have your pitch part it shouldn't be
02:50:29.279 longer than three minutes like tops
02:50:32.120 because no one really gives a [ __ ] and
02:50:33.960 at the end of the day the reason they're
02:50:35.279 going to buy is going to be because of
02:50:37.120 how understood they
02:50:39.800 feel so how much when you went through
02:50:42.479 that overview of the pain you were able
02:50:44.399 to restate back to them accurately
02:50:47.520 exactly how they felt felt and the
02:50:49.319 struggles they are experiencing which is
02:50:51.319 why you need to shut the [ __ ] up when
02:50:52.640 they're talking right and so there's
02:50:55.399 only three things that are ever said on
02:50:57.000 a sales call do you guys know what they
02:50:58.319 are there's only three things that ever
02:51:00.239 come out of your
02:51:01.479 mouth
02:51:03.040 questions restatements and anecdotal
02:51:06.279 stories which is the story that I just
02:51:07.520 referenced the three stories that you
02:51:09.080 will use to break a belief that's it so
02:51:12.040 this so that's how you sell them the
02:51:13.200 vacation you have these little sound
02:51:14.680 bites right I'll give you another
02:51:16.120 example so if I was doing um if I was
02:51:18.319 doing food right I'm like listen uh
02:51:21.439 three parts of the program Fitness
02:51:22.960 accountability so nutrition wise you've
02:51:25.600 got to eat stuff that's going to make
02:51:28.399 you lose weight can we agree on that yes
02:51:30.560 okay cool but the problem is you don't
02:51:32.399 want to do that right that's where we're
02:51:33.600 here right right okay so let me ask you
02:51:36.239 a question when uh do you feel like
02:51:38.600 what's your favorite TV show they're
02:51:40.279 going to be like
02:51:42.600 uh whatever Game of Thrones you're like
02:51:45.000 okay Game of Thrones do you feel like
02:51:46.439 you need to get like motivated to watch
02:51:48.560 came through like man I was trying to
02:51:50.080 watch it tonight but I just couldn't you
02:51:51.600 know I just I just I got really busy and
02:51:53.239 I just couldn't sit down on the couch
02:51:54.399 and turn the TV on I couldn't do it
02:51:55.920 right of course not because you look
02:51:57.920 forward to it because you wanted to do
02:51:59.319 it and the key that we're going to do
02:52:00.880 here is we're going to get you to look
02:52:02.200 forward to the foods that you're eating
02:52:03.680 because if you look forward to it you
02:52:04.520 don't need to be motivated because you
02:52:05.840 do it on your own because you like it
02:52:07.279 does that make sense right so what I
02:52:11.080 didn't talk about the macros and the
02:52:13.920 carb cycling and the intermittent
02:52:15.479 fasting and the calorie counting and the
02:52:17.399 blah blah blah blah blah because the end
02:52:18.760 of the day that does not matter what
02:52:20.680 they want is for them to solve the
02:52:23.479 problem and have it be painfree right
02:52:25.680 and that's what we're explaining to them
02:52:26.720 so that's selling the vacation right and
02:52:28.319 this is a saying that I've used for a
02:52:29.479 long time which is sell the vacation not
02:52:30.920 the plane fright right and so this is
02:52:33.239 what everyone else talks about they're
02:52:34.399 like sir for us to get you these results
02:52:36.319 you're going to have to take your pants
02:52:37.359 off you're goingon to have to jump
02:52:38.120 through this Loop you're gonna have to
02:52:39.359 go through the TSA the airport lines
02:52:41.000 pack your suitcases take your shoes off
02:52:42.520 do the layovers connect your flights uh
02:52:44.560 have a person farting next to you don't
02:52:45.960 worry they don't have covid you'll have
02:52:47.600 turbulence probably on the plane then as
02:52:49.840 soon as you're out you think you're done
02:52:51.080 you still have to wait a baggage CLA
02:52:52.319 they probably lost your bag right and in
02:52:54.120 our world it's your modules your MPL
02:52:55.479 your Macros your workouts your support
02:52:56.640 team your URLs your domains your funnels
02:52:58.479 your targeting your ads and the other
02:53:00.479 [ __ ] that doesn't matter right but
02:53:02.439 instead what they want is you sell Maui
02:53:04.960 Final Destination and you always sell
02:53:06.680 the same thing because the difference is
02:53:08.520 only the level of service and how they
02:53:09.960 want to get there right if you have
02:53:11.399 multiple levels of service so do they
02:53:13.080 want to swim to Maui to where they're
02:53:14.560 trying to go there's sharks and you
02:53:16.560 could drown or get robbed right this
02:53:18.760 chick crazy uh do they want to take a
02:53:21.439 boat to Maui it'll take a little longer
02:53:23.279 but there's no shark attacks but there's
02:53:25.080 still no Wi-Fi and you're kind of you
02:53:26.479 know in the sun uh do you want to take a
02:53:28.000 normal flight to Maui get there a little
02:53:29.760 faster still smells bad has security bad
02:53:31.560 food but you're going to get there or do
02:53:33.000 you want to take a private jet to Maui
02:53:34.319 right direct non-stop champagne on the
02:53:35.840 plane suitcase is packed when you arrive
02:53:38.319 right and so that's the selling piece e
02:53:41.560 is explaining way they concerns and so
02:53:43.680 these are the questions that sound like
02:53:45.359 um so there's I'm sure Mike has already
02:53:47.560 taught you a lot of the uh the obstacle
02:53:49.239 overcome Concepts right so fundamentally
02:53:53.080 there's there's three big ones right
02:53:54.359 price and rather than teach you like the
02:53:56.800 uh the the the drilling of the obstacles
02:53:59.080 I told you there's two things you need
02:54:00.080 to memorize one of them are the stories
02:54:01.760 the second are the obstacle overcomes
02:54:03.479 all right because those are the things
02:54:04.520 that you're in the Red Zone like that's
02:54:06.520 not where you start thinking about what
02:54:07.800 you're going to say all right so the two
02:54:10.080 things that you need to memorize as a
02:54:11.479 salesperson are the stories about what
02:54:13.760 you
02:54:14.680 sell and the obstacles that you're going
02:54:16.920 to encounter when you're in the red zone
02:54:19.399 the questions on the front end you need
02:54:20.920 to know the Milestones you need to hit
02:54:22.720 in order to move forward and this is one
02:54:24.399 of the big mistakes I'm sure Mike talks
02:54:26.040 about a lot which is you need to sit in
02:54:28.319 the pain if someone does not clarify why
02:54:31.040 they need a solution you do not ask for
02:54:33.200 the sale if they're if we just say hey
02:54:35.760 you know what what brought you to here
02:54:37.200 today I just want to find out more
02:54:38.520 information Okay cool so you know let me
02:54:41.279 tell you about the program like that's
02:54:42.680 not we didn't get the [ __ ] like we
02:54:43.960 don't know why they're there we don't
02:54:45.120 know what their goals are like one of
02:54:46.720 the things drives me nuts about my team
02:54:48.040 sometimes is I'm like dude we're eight
02:54:49.600 minutes in the conversation I was like I
02:54:50.720 don't know how many clients they have I
02:54:51.840 don't know what their revenue is I don't
02:54:52.960 know what their profit is I don't know
02:54:54.040 what their biggest pain and struggle was
02:54:55.479 right now I'm like what are you doing
02:54:57.760 I'm like you just told them they're like
02:54:59.160 oh Jim is $100 million doll company I'm
02:55:01.040 like they don't give a [ __ ] but they do
02:55:03.800 my sales guys because they get their OS
02:55:05.279 puffed up right but it has nothing to do
02:55:07.200 with the prospect they do not care right
02:55:08.960 they only care about them so right
02:55:11.120 that's right yeah that's the issue right
02:55:14.880 everyone talks way too much about the
02:55:16.239 product and so when you're training
02:55:17.880 sales people you don't train them on the
02:55:20.439 product you train them on the
02:55:24.800 prospect the product doesn't matter I
02:55:26.960 mean it matters obviously from like how
02:55:28.279 you're going to make money because you
02:55:29.200 have to do a good job because I'm going
02:55:30.439 to get that in the second point but in
02:55:32.120 terms of when you are selling and
02:55:34.040 training someone if you guys know
02:55:36.520 someone or know a specific Niche really
02:55:38.720 well then you will know their pains and
02:55:41.080 if you have a new salesperson you hear
02:55:42.920 them say [ __ ] and you're like that's not
02:55:44.640 what he thinks what is's he doing he
02:55:46.200 might know the product perfectly but he
02:55:48.040 just said that the guy's problem was not
02:55:49.560 the problem and so then it doesn't
02:55:51.080 matter what the product is because he
02:55:52.200 doesn't feel like it's for him even
02:55:53.600 though it's totally for him but you just
02:55:55.479 misarticulated the problem that's where
02:55:57.920 the clarity has to happen if you nail
02:55:59.560 that the rest of the pitch is easy all
02:56:01.640 right and so the key here is relying on
02:56:04.920 past agreements that have already been
02:56:06.319 made so this person with their partner
02:56:08.800 with their spouse with their B you know
02:56:10.439 whatever has that person knows that
02:56:13.279 there's a problem and they also don't
02:56:15.239 approve of that problem and so why would
02:56:17.080 they be in any way against remedying a
02:56:19.000 problem that they already don't approve
02:56:20.760 of right and then finally we always tack
02:56:23.399 on sometimes it's better ask for
02:56:24.680 forgiveness than permission right ha
02:56:26.399 depends on the ticket sale right but you
02:56:28.160 can get those in right and then
02:56:29.720 obviously last last case here is you
02:56:32.399 just do a delayed close and say let's
02:56:33.720 get your car down we can put it down
02:56:34.960 payment we can pay the rest on Friday
02:56:36.760 and if between now and then you know
02:56:38.479 your partner comes back and says no man
02:56:40.080 I want to be poor I want to keep
02:56:41.560 struggling and like I want to never make
02:56:43.600 money and like continue to do this for
02:56:45.160 the rest of our lives and I'll
02:56:46.279 absolutely tear up the contract don't
02:56:47.479 worry about it
02:56:49.600 right finally you've got stalls right I
02:56:52.080 need to think about it so these are
02:56:55.600 because people don't people are afraid
02:56:57.640 of making mistakes right people are
02:56:59.920 afraid of making mistakes and because of
02:57:02.760 that they don't like making decisions
02:57:05.200 because it's easier to let life make the
02:57:06.760 decision for you and so they like doing
02:57:08.359 it that way because then they feel like
02:57:10.640 it's not their fault right and so I mean
02:57:14.000 a great obstacle over for this is what's
02:57:15.680 your main concern which is usually my
02:57:17.239 number one thing I go to when someone's
02:57:18.520 like I need to think about it it's like
02:57:19.720 totally what's your main concern right
02:57:21.279 let's think about it together right and
02:57:23.720 so fundamentally these are the things
02:57:25.239 that they need to know do you feel like
02:57:27.239 what we're doing can meet your needs and
02:57:28.840 solve the problem yes or no yes do you
02:57:31.880 want to work with us as a company do you
02:57:34.160 like our values do you like what we
02:57:35.520 stand for do you believe what we believe
02:57:37.160 about the world yes do you have access
02:57:39.840 to funds or know someone who does yes
02:57:42.680 well then let's rock and roll because
02:57:44.200 those are the only things we know to me
02:57:46.080 the B decision right do you like the
02:57:47.840 product do you like us and do you have
02:57:50.000 the money to do it that's it simple as
02:57:52.319 that right and so when we walk through
02:57:54.200 those if you encounter these situations
02:57:56.760 obviously there's you know if you're
02:57:58.080 going to do it now sooner or later you
02:57:59.319 might as well like there's plenty of
02:58:00.640 things to say but I think it's more
02:58:02.600 important to understand the theory
02:58:03.760 behind why someone has this objection
02:58:06.760 right they have an objection around
02:58:07.960 price because they don't see the value
02:58:09.200 because you didn't articulate it they
02:58:11.000 have an objection around decision maker
02:58:12.239 usually because you [ __ ] something up
02:58:13.239 earlier in the sale but at this point
02:58:14.600 you're in the red zone so you got to
02:58:15.600 deal with it so you rely on pasted
02:58:17.479 agreements if they come with a stall
02:58:19.560 then you help them confront a decision
02:58:21.080 and make a logical choice and teach them
02:58:23.359 how to make a decision that in that
02:58:25.160 moment you say what are you most afraid
02:58:26.880 of happening I'm afraid of you just
02:58:29.920 you're afraid of me taking the money
02:58:31.239 right just taking your money and you
02:58:32.279 getting nothing right again well let me
02:58:34.239 tell you how that's not going to happen
02:58:35.880 right you can bring their concerns all
02:58:37.479 right and then finally they say yes and
02:58:38.760 you're like awesome and this is where if
02:58:40.120 you're selling for someone else get them
02:58:41.880 to send a personalized video like hey
02:58:43.479 Johnny saw you just signed up with us
02:58:44.840 today super pumped to have you uh you're
02:58:47.439 going to be meeting with Heather
02:58:48.399 tomorrow she's going to get you kicked
02:58:49.680 off um you should in the mail get a
02:58:51.640 special gift so keep lookout for that
02:58:53.800 and then uh you know send a handwritten
02:58:55.319 card if someone just bought a really
02:58:56.880 expensive thing people are making their
02:58:58.880 decision about whether they believe in
02:59:00.160 you as a company within the first 48
02:59:01.960 hours after the sale they make a
02:59:04.439 decision of whether or not they're going
02:59:05.680 to be with you in the long term and how
02:59:07.640 they are treated in the first 48 hours
02:59:09.239 after they give you money so it's
02:59:11.160 critical and it's usually in that point
02:59:13.359 that people [ __ ] up and just ignore them
02:59:15.720 framework two and you know Mike I can
02:59:17.760 stop I'll just do framework two and then
02:59:19.279 we can do the Q&A because if I don't
02:59:20.760 have time to scale the sales teams I can
02:59:22.040 hit on the points later um so this is a
02:59:24.840 big one for everyone who is who's newer
02:59:26.760 to sales all right if you
02:59:29.359 believe you can outperform to season
02:59:31.600 sales rep by learning control your tone
02:59:33.680 all right and so I reworked all of our
02:59:35.840 scripts into the closer framework and
02:59:37.279 the thing is is immediately some people
02:59:39.080 were crushing it right While others were
02:59:40.840 still not selling [ __ ] and I was like
02:59:42.479 what the [ __ ] right and so I talked to
02:59:44.479 my friends and they were like dude you
02:59:45.680 should read this book by Jordan buffer
02:59:47.560 and the big biggest thing that I got
02:59:48.600 from the book was just he was very
02:59:50.520 specific about tonality and that was a
02:59:52.560 big shift for me in just learning to
02:59:55.399 teach how to ask the question not just
02:59:58.640 asking the question right and
03:00:01.399 so in the book he talks about having the
03:00:04.319 same issue that I had with scaling sales
03:00:06.000 it's like I give the script to two guys
03:00:07.200 some guy crushes some guy doesn't I'm
03:00:08.359 like what the [ __ ] right and the thing
03:00:09.720 is there's a hidden dialogue that the
03:00:12.000 sales team does not know that they are
03:00:13.520 talking in right and so the words are
03:00:16.680 not going to be enough all right they're
03:00:18.200 just literally 10% so the words that you
03:00:20.640 have it might be the most tested script
03:00:22.160 in the world it's still only 10% 90% is
03:00:25.680 how you say the words right because how
03:00:28.840 you say what you say is tonality like
03:00:31.880 right now I could give everyone here you
03:00:33.760 know Jerry Seinfeld standup script you
03:00:36.080 could read it it wouldn't be funny right
03:00:39.000 because it's not just that you had the
03:00:40.359 script it's how you deliver it right and
03:00:42.520 that takes time to develop right and
03:00:44.560 that's kind of unconscious Mastery and
03:00:46.479 so there's two ways to do this all right
03:00:48.239 that I have found you can either trick
03:00:49.840 yourself into it or you can train
03:00:51.720 yourself to do it all right and since we
03:00:54.080 don't have enough time to uh to train on
03:00:57.160 the influence of tonalities here's the
03:00:58.640 trick that I teach all right conviction
03:01:01.080 will correct your
03:01:02.760 tone conviction made real so um let me
03:01:06.160 tell you this story so I was I was
03:01:08.920 brought in to do a day of Consulting for
03:01:10.640 this mortgage leads company to train
03:01:12.000 their sales team and the first half of
03:01:14.800 the day I reworked the whole script I
03:01:16.120 put the closure framework made it a
03:01:17.319 question based um sale and then I came
03:01:20.439 in and they were expecting me to like
03:01:21.600 rain you know fire and brimstone on
03:01:23.359 these guys and so I sat down I was like
03:01:25.040 who's the guy having the most trouble it
03:01:26.160 was this guy John so I was like John and
03:01:28.200 they were still on the leads I was like
03:01:30.040 John how good are the leads he was like
03:01:34.160 well you know and I was like we're good
03:01:36.520 thanks and I was like let me show you
03:01:38.680 how you would answer it if you actually
03:01:39.880 believed that the leads were good I was
03:01:41.399 like you say like dude these leads are
03:01:42.800 [ __ ] unbelievable right now I'm
03:01:44.239 studying for my real estate exam so I
03:01:45.760 can get in on these leads my aunt is her
03:01:48.200 and she has more business she can handle
03:01:49.479 and I'm sending her traffic I'm trying
03:01:51.000 to get my my my brother to do it with me
03:01:53.160 I'm not sure how long I'm in a worker
03:01:54.439 because these leads are killing it for
03:01:55.560 us
03:01:58.120 right if you believe in the product you
03:02:01.239 don't need to have all the sales skills
03:02:03.520 you'll do it the right way because
03:02:05.000 you'll actually want to help the person
03:02:06.880 so that's why the most important part of
03:02:09.040 the sale is the product Because unless
03:02:11.560 you're a malicious
03:02:13.479 person like most people here was
03:02:15.520 everyone here have some level of ethics
03:02:17.479 on some level like no near just wants to
03:02:18.920 like take someone's last dollar right so
03:02:21.720 then the only way to sell hard because
03:02:24.319 if you're going to close you got to sell
03:02:25.880 hard the only way to sell hard is to
03:02:27.840 believe through and through balls to
03:02:29.200 bones when you look at yourself in the
03:02:30.319 mirror at night this is what I talked
03:02:31.760 about when Mike said at the very
03:02:32.800 beginning like what happens when people
03:02:34.359 start hating on you the only way that
03:02:36.279 I've been able to stay where we're at in
03:02:37.680 the gym industry Mike knows the amount
03:02:39.080 of hate that I get right the only way
03:02:41.080 we've been able to do that is that I
03:02:42.680 read the
03:02:44.000 testimonials the thousand of them that I
03:02:46.680 have of Jim who have gone to six figures
03:02:49.359 of the hundred gyms we've taken to seven
03:02:51.120 figures right like I know beyond a
03:02:54.040 shadow of a doubt that our product works
03:02:56.239 I also know that if you sign up for a
03:02:58.080 gym not everyone loses weight and I'm
03:03:00.239 willing to deal with that I I'm willing
03:03:02.600 to give everyone the opportunity to
03:03:04.800 change their life so here's the tactics
03:03:07.040 around this reread testimonials out loud
03:03:10.920 daily in front of your sales team all
03:03:12.720 right and if the business that you're
03:03:13.800 working for doesn't have testimonials
03:03:15.279 find another business all right I'm
03:03:17.040 serious you're not going to be able to
03:03:18.239 close unless you're like literally
03:03:20.000 unless you're unethical you're not going
03:03:21.000 to be able to close so go find something
03:03:23.000 that is a good product because there's
03:03:24.319 plenty of them out there all right find
03:03:26.200 a good product that you believe in you
03:03:27.880 just see tons of testimonials and then
03:03:30.000 read those every day in front of the
03:03:32.000 team all right second well this is for
03:03:34.479 the business owners but fix everything
03:03:36.120 you possibly can about the product all
03:03:37.960 right and never blame a customer for
03:03:39.640 lack of success so as much as there are
03:03:41.840 people who have not been successful
03:03:43.880 who've used gym launch I still take the
03:03:47.000 fact that they were not successful and I
03:03:48.319 think what could I have done that would
03:03:50.160 have made the next person like them
03:03:51.520 successful and you plug the hole right
03:03:53.760 if you do that over and over and over
03:03:55.920 and over again you know truly at the end
03:03:58.640 of the day when you look at yourself in
03:03:59.880 the mirror when no one else is watching
03:04:01.680 whether or not you truly put the effort
03:04:03.279 forth that merits the price that you are
03:04:05.200 charging right and only you can know
03:04:07.080 that and the thing is is like the reason
03:04:09.160 salese get beat up is because they don't
03:04:11.760 put the work in and then it grates on
03:04:13.520 their soul and then eventually they burn
03:04:15.840 out they burn out not because they can't
03:04:17.120 handle no but because they can't handle
03:04:18.560 how they feel about
03:04:20.479 themselves right and so you have to put
03:04:23.000 the work in to have the conviction
03:04:24.880 because that's what's going to get you
03:04:25.960 through it if you've ever met someone
03:04:28.000 who's a born again Christian all right
03:04:30.880 they are convicted they do not care how
03:04:33.479 many people tell them to shove it
03:04:35.800 because they are trying to save people's
03:04:39.800 Souls it's real like if you let that hit
03:04:42.239 you it's real you know what I mean and
03:04:44.239 if you can be a disciple of whatever the
03:04:47.239 product you have an evangelist in the
03:04:49.160 truest terms then all the scripting
03:04:51.800 stuff it won't matter why are some of
03:04:53.520 the best sales people clients who had
03:04:55.279 success because they believe in it
03:04:57.040 that's it and the most convicted person
03:04:59.560 will always win the fight right they'll
03:05:02.200 always lead the dance because they have
03:05:04.479 conviction in their skepticism you have
03:05:06.520 conviction in your product and one of
03:05:08.000 you is going to win out right and it's
03:05:10.359 the question is whose belief is stronger
03:05:12.279 because belief isn't binary it's not do
03:05:14.120 I believe or do I not believe it's how
03:05:15.479 much do I believe to what extent do I
03:05:17.399 believe would I bet $1,000 on this
03:05:19.760 product would I bet $10,000 on this
03:05:21.520 product would I sell my mother this
03:05:23.399 product think about it if you would sell
03:05:26.000 your mother this product how convicted
03:05:28.600 are
03:05:29.520 you probably very and you will have no
03:05:32.439 problem closing deals and notice that I
03:05:34.479 have a lower tone right now so that you
03:05:36.200 listen to the words that I'm saying so
03:05:37.479 you think that they're
03:05:38.720 important in terms of uh the training
03:05:41.080 schedule 60 minutes a day 5 days a week
03:05:43.520 my guys do world class sales training
03:05:45.040 they text me in the morning before they
03:05:46.200 wake up they text me once they're done
03:05:48.680 uh they do the first 25 minutes they
03:05:50.279 read the script out loud five minutes
03:05:52.279 they drill obstacles I need to think
03:05:54.200 about it I need to talk to my partner um
03:05:56.239 this is expensive and then they talk
03:05:58.880 they they drill the second half right as
03:06:00.160 a closer you got to talk you got to
03:06:01.359 listen you got to train both skills
03:06:02.880 right the talking is the tone and saying
03:06:04.479 the words the right way in the right
03:06:05.600 sequence without having to think about
03:06:06.800 it the listening is going over recording
03:06:09.359 and figure out what went right what went
03:06:11.680 wrong and what we're going to do next
03:06:12.960 time and saying it drilling it as a team
03:06:15.479 marking it and moving to the next one
03:06:18.239 that's the short answer we 10x the
03:06:20.439 recurring Revenue in one of my portfolio
03:06:22.080 companies by using what we call the
03:06:23.640 diagnostic sale there are seven steps
03:06:25.840 that you can use to follow the script
03:06:27.800 and apply it to your business enjoy I
03:06:29.640 cross $100 million in net worth by age
03:06:31.239 32 I sold my first big company for 46.2
03:06:34.000 million and the reason we're able to do
03:06:36.439 that is because we know how to grow
03:06:37.800 companies and so now I buy companies at
03:06:40.279 a lower price I grow them and then we
03:06:42.600 sell them and so I want to talk to you
03:06:44.600 about one of the companies we just
03:06:45.640 bought uh we bought them a year and a
03:06:48.600 half ago I think or a year ago uh they
03:06:50.720 had 14 locations so it was a chain of
03:06:53.359 brick and mortar and since then we've
03:06:55.439 gone from 14 to 32 locations and the
03:06:58.040 reason we're able to do that is because
03:06:59.439 we focused on the sales process and
03:07:01.840 through a process that I want to walk
03:07:03.040 you through something that I call the
03:07:04.520 diagnostic sale we're able to 10x the
03:07:06.760 recurring revenue of the business across
03:07:08.479 all the locations so before we get into
03:07:10.279 the nitty-gritty of the story let me
03:07:11.399 just walk you through the steps in the
03:07:12.560 diagnostic process first is we like to
03:07:14.479 have some sort of pre-sale questionnaire
03:07:16.040 which the purpose of that is to get get
03:07:17.600 more information that arms the
03:07:18.560 salesperson so they know who they're
03:07:19.680 talking to what their pains are but from
03:07:21.160 the sales perspective for them they also
03:07:24.399 increase their awareness of the problem
03:07:26.520 second is we get their information in
03:07:27.680 their credit card which is key and I'll
03:07:28.840 explain why it later uh third is we want
03:07:31.239 to understand what their current
03:07:32.040 situation is where are you at today then
03:07:33.960 we have your desired state so where
03:07:35.200 would you like to be at and then what's
03:07:37.000 the obstacle why aren't you there and
03:07:38.760 then finally once we have these big
03:07:40.680 three we present the desired State and
03:07:43.600 our vehicle to overcome the obstacle and
03:07:45.840 we tie our price to the way we're going
03:07:47.760 to get them there and then finally we
03:07:49.520 give them an incentive to prepay so
03:07:51.040 here's the five steps that we follow to
03:07:52.640 actually get this done so number one is
03:07:54.040 that we secret
03:07:55.279 shopped the business so we actually
03:07:57.640 looked into it we went there by the way
03:07:59.600 you should secret shop your own business
03:08:01.000 highly recommend doing it you'll be
03:08:02.399 horrified by what you hear your sales
03:08:04.080 guys say you're like I thought we had a
03:08:05.319 script what are you even doing number
03:08:06.800 two is from there this is basically
03:08:08.520 information gathering we figure out what
03:08:10.080 the constraint is okay where do we think
03:08:12.120 there's big opportunities in the
03:08:13.680 business now you should think about
03:08:15.479 yourself as your own business consultant
03:08:16.760 if you could buy your business today and
03:08:18.720 look at your business what would be the
03:08:20.080 no duh thing that you would do now for
03:08:21.920 this particular business we thought that
03:08:23.600 they had an offer constraint which
03:08:25.200 really came down to packaging we had
03:08:27.040 offer slash packaging because
03:08:29.520 fundamentally we're not going to change
03:08:31.279 the core of the business we're not going
03:08:32.560 to all of a sudden start selling soap
03:08:34.359 when you sell HVAC like that's not going
03:08:37.279 to happen right so the core of the
03:08:39.160 business can remain unchanged it's how
03:08:41.160 we're going to package the services we
03:08:43.640 deliver or that the services we sell to
03:08:45.680 a customer how are we're goingon to get
03:08:46.399 them to perceive what we're selling we
03:08:48.880 gathered the data we figured out the
03:08:50.120 constraint was that they should get way
03:08:51.160 more re-bookings which I thought was an
03:08:52.760 offer and packaging issue which is we
03:08:54.120 need to sell the solution sell the goal
03:08:56.040 and so number four is okay if we assume
03:08:57.880 that we're going to make this new
03:08:58.920 transition to this new new offer new
03:09:01.040 packaging we have to anticipate so you
03:09:03.880 we call it killing zombies uh which is
03:09:05.880 one way of putting it you anticipate the
03:09:08.200 obstacles or objections that people are
03:09:09.520 going to throw at you ahead of time
03:09:11.920 write this in neon marker above your
03:09:13.760 sales team which is it's way harder to
03:09:16.840 get someone to buy buy after you
03:09:18.080 presented the price because now they're
03:09:20.080 like he's trying to sell me so we have
03:09:22.040 to counter that before we become
03:09:23.560 salespeople in their mind we are a
03:09:26.080 trusted expert ideally if we're
03:09:27.600 positioned well and you should be that
03:09:28.960 way if you know what you're talking
03:09:29.960 about and I like to use the frame of
03:09:32.160 childlike curiosity I always tilt my
03:09:34.279 head I probably even did it
03:09:35.319 subconsciously just now you tilt your
03:09:37.279 head when you ask the question because
03:09:38.680 it's non-threatening you're like huh
03:09:40.800 that's weird what changed between then
03:09:42.279 and now just so I understand then they
03:09:44.160 can tell you rather than be like you
03:09:46.000 said that your husband said supports you
03:09:48.279 you can't say that now you have to buy
03:09:50.479 doesn't work that way if you win the
03:09:52.040 argument in a sale you lose the sale the
03:09:54.000 only way that you win the sale is being
03:09:56.279 willing to lose being right and so the
03:09:58.479 fifth step and this is the ongoing step
03:10:00.479 is that you implement the diagnostic
03:10:01.760 sales process so it's implementation so
03:10:04.200 now that I just outlined the five steps
03:10:05.960 let me deep dive into the implementation
03:10:07.680 into the actual business and how it did
03:10:09.200 this with this particular business when
03:10:11.000 we bought them I spent 4 hours with our
03:10:13.960 director of sales and we outlined the
03:10:15.720 new sales process we wanted to implement
03:10:18.120 and as soon as we implemented that sales
03:10:20.040 process we 4X LTV progression meaning
03:10:23.920 how much people paid us it went from 200
03:10:27.000 to 800 so really big jump and we the
03:10:30.520 crazy thing about this is that we didn't
03:10:31.920 change what we delivered we only changed
03:10:34.640 how we presented it and so this is the
03:10:37.479 key of how we create value how we scale
03:10:39.200 companies how we grow companies and many
03:10:42.000 companies keep these things as Secrets
03:10:44.520 uh as their special sauce and I just
03:10:46.359 fundamentally believe that that the more
03:10:48.040 we put out the more we get back and so
03:10:49.720 that's why I operate this way all right
03:10:51.279 so I will hold nothing back and this is
03:10:52.920 something I call the diagnostic sales
03:10:54.359 process now to be very clear the
03:10:57.399 diagnostic sales process is one of two
03:10:59.200 different sales or maybe three different
03:11:00.560 sales processes big picture that you can
03:11:02.600 have in a business one is a
03:11:04.160 transactional sale all the way on this
03:11:09.080 extreme so on one side you've got
03:11:11.279 transactional
03:11:13.120 sales and on this side you've got
03:11:15.160 Enterprise sales which is like
03:11:17.840 uh relational sales like if you think
03:11:19.399 about like you're selling some big
03:11:20.560 Fortune 500 company you have to get
03:11:22.239 stakeholders involved get budget
03:11:24.120 approval there's all that stuff and on
03:11:25.800 transactional side you've got like High
03:11:27.960 Velocity sales we're talking 20 30
03:11:29.880 minute sales a guy who stands in of the
03:11:31.640 car wash sells Car Wash somebody sells
03:11:33.040 gym memberships transactional and then
03:11:34.960 you've kind of got like this Middle
03:11:36.560 where you might sell something that's a
03:11:37.800 little bit higher ticket but it's a
03:11:39.239 little bit more custom all right now
03:11:41.560 what we did was I took their sale from
03:11:43.800 here a purely transactional sale and
03:11:46.239 moved it towards custom
03:11:47.800 all right now in a transactional sale
03:11:49.920 you typically fit the customer to the
03:11:52.600 product and so let's say that I sell
03:11:54.880 pens all right so I sell pens if
03:11:57.640 somebody comes in I'm going to basically
03:12:00.279 spend all my effort listening to what
03:12:02.040 they say they want and then telling them
03:12:03.760 how this pen fits their needs or I have
03:12:07.279 to basically say your needs are wrong
03:12:08.960 let me educate you more and this
03:12:10.600 actually solves all your problems right
03:12:12.520 and so those are pretty much the only
03:12:13.600 two approaches you can take in a
03:12:15.120 transactional sale now the advantages of
03:12:17.439 having this type of sale is that it's
03:12:19.160 really fast uh they tend to be lower
03:12:21.040 ticket in general uh and from an
03:12:23.520 operational perspective in the business
03:12:25.160 you don't need to personalize anything
03:12:26.720 and so you get the sales team and the
03:12:28.920 sales process to basically Orient
03:12:31.000 everyone like a funnel down to one
03:12:32.399 solution and then you just make a ton of
03:12:34.200 these Solutions and you get lots of
03:12:35.840 efficiencies because you only have to
03:12:37.040 produce one thing this the custom sale
03:12:40.880 is a harder sale sry easier sale to do
03:12:43.680 but harder on the operational side and
03:12:45.560 so the magic happens when you can
03:12:47.960 actually Bridge the product component of
03:12:52.239 transactional which you say okay we only
03:12:54.680 sell these types of widgets this is the
03:12:56.160 only thing we deliver
03:12:58.000 but I can do it in a way that feels
03:13:00.880 custom feels personalized all right so
03:13:03.359 I'm going to give you two examples and
03:13:04.760 I'll explain this one in a second this
03:13:05.960 chart that I have here which if you
03:13:07.640 could take your recurring revenue from
03:13:08.960 that to that just by changing how you
03:13:10.720 sell if you'd want to do that hang tight
03:13:12.720 we're going to break that the process so
03:13:15.520 if I had cuz I did this in the gym in
03:13:17.760 the gym world too which is part of why
03:13:20.359 our gyms make more money so a
03:13:22.560 traditional sale look something like
03:13:24.239 this someone comes in so this is
03:13:27.640 traditional and you say we have a
03:13:29.319 membership that's you know whatever $99
03:13:31.520 per month all right that's your
03:13:33.040 membership and you say our membership
03:13:35.359 has this this this and this and you want
03:13:39.040 that right because it's going to help
03:13:40.560 you accomplish all your dreams okay
03:13:43.120 sometimes you get people sometimes you
03:13:44.600 don't what I do
03:13:47.960 we do something called a
03:13:49.840 diagnostic and so the first thing is
03:13:52.160 that when the person walks in the door
03:13:54.840 we get them to fill out a pre-sale
03:13:57.439 questionnaire and so that's like an
03:13:59.680 application in a digital process but an
03:14:01.399 inperson process it follows the same
03:14:03.080 logic which by the way internet
03:14:05.120 businesses follow local businesses local
03:14:06.840 businesses can also model internet
03:14:08.160 businesses when you find out something
03:14:09.200 works in one place which I think has
03:14:10.520 been one of the big advantage of I've
03:14:11.760 had in business is I try and put it in a
03:14:13.279 completely different place and it often
03:14:14.399 works too if you understand the concept
03:14:16.319 and so we fill out a pre-sale
03:14:17.520 questionnaire now the pre-sale
03:14:18.920 questionnaire simply walks them through
03:14:20.920 all the reasons they walked in today and
03:14:22.560 it ask them the same question in
03:14:23.920 multiple different ways so it's like hey
03:14:26.160 like what brought you in today what's
03:14:27.960 the current problem you're dealing with
03:14:29.439 how long you've been dealing with it if
03:14:30.920 you had to quantify how much this has
03:14:33.160 cost you financially what would it be uh
03:14:35.960 if it continued for 5 years how much
03:14:37.960 worse would the situation be and so the
03:14:39.720 whole point is we're trying to agitate
03:14:41.080 tame we're trying to bring attention to
03:14:43.560 this problem and Elevate its importance
03:14:45.160 so that's what the pre-sale
03:14:45.960 questionnaire does now
03:14:48.239 the second thing is we get info and this
03:14:49.840 is very key so when someone comes in
03:14:51.840 after that we say hey I want to I want
03:14:53.359 to set up your account profile and so
03:14:55.080 when you do that you collect their
03:14:56.239 information and this is the key part you
03:14:59.160 get their credit card now you're like
03:15:00.760 wait a second I'm getting a credit card
03:15:02.399 but I haven't sold anything exactly and
03:15:04.680 you do that so that when you do sell
03:15:06.200 something later you don't have to ask
03:15:07.560 for it now you get the pre-sale they're
03:15:10.600 like wow I really do need this thing you
03:15:12.239 say hey let me complete your customer
03:15:13.600 profile just standard procedure no big
03:15:15.200 deal all right then you get their info
03:15:17.080 now if they're like well I don't want to
03:15:18.080 give you my credit card you're just like
03:15:19.279 it's just how the system works it's how
03:15:20.479 we complete
03:15:21.520 profiles and then they'll give it to you
03:15:24.040 all right so from there this is the this
03:15:28.000 is where the special the special magic
03:15:30.199 that's unique to each individual
03:15:32.239 business happens so in the weight loss
03:15:34.000 business I want to understand where
03:15:35.439 their goal at so we say what's
03:15:39.760 current and then four what's
03:15:44.359 desired where are you now where would
03:15:47.040 you like to be and then this one you ask
03:15:50.080 them say what's the
03:15:53.239 obstacle what's in between these two
03:15:55.439 things is the obstacle right current
03:15:58.040 I've got an obstacle getting in the way
03:15:59.279 of my desired that's all we're asking in
03:16:01.239 the process now in weight loss and in
03:16:04.040 most businesses the thing the person
03:16:06.600 thinks is in the way is often not the
03:16:08.800 real thing in the way and that's because
03:16:10.600 they've never had this conversation
03:16:11.800 before they clearly haven't solved the
03:16:13.199 solution and that's why they're coming
03:16:14.319 to you and so you want to just get their
03:16:16.600 word words more so so that you can
03:16:18.640 explain it back to them using the
03:16:19.960 language they gave you all right and so
03:16:22.520 in the weight loss world for example
03:16:25.000 instead of selling a membership I would
03:16:27.080 say okay well it sounds like you need
03:16:28.960 these three things Fitness distri
03:16:30.120 accountability Fitness wise you need to
03:16:31.600 work out X days a week nutrition-wise
03:16:33.560 you need to eat this food at this time
03:16:36.520 and we can help you meal prep the stuff
03:16:38.000 so you got when you go to restaurants
03:16:39.080 you can still stick on it and you need
03:16:40.880 accountability because if you don't if
03:16:42.000 you do if if I give you the best fitness
03:16:43.520 plan and the best nutrition plan but you
03:16:44.880 don't show up doesn't matter right
03:16:46.560 account is what makes the whole thing
03:16:47.680 work great finished nutrition
03:16:49.000 accountability easy three-step framework
03:16:51.160 fantastic now this is where it becomes
03:16:53.760 diagnostic now most
03:16:56.439 customers and this is why this is where
03:16:58.439 the magic happens is
03:17:00.439 that even if you still deliver the same
03:17:02.800 thing so fundamentally when I switch the
03:17:04.359 sales process the gyms remain the same
03:17:06.279 they still have workouts they still have
03:17:07.399 nutrition help they still have
03:17:08.359 accountability nothing changed but how
03:17:10.160 we presented changes and so rather than
03:17:12.640 saying hey I'm going to sell a four-week
03:17:14.680 thing or a six week thing I say hey
03:17:16.920 you're
03:17:17.880 currently 200 lb Okay now what's your
03:17:21.920 high school weight she says I want to I
03:17:24.080 want to get to 140 you say okay cool you
03:17:26.160 want to get to 140 this is your desired
03:17:28.439 okay so you have a 60 pound difference
03:17:30.399 now what we found is that we don't want
03:17:31.920 people to lose more than pound and a
03:17:33.960 half to two pounds a week all right so
03:17:35.640 let's just be conservative and call it
03:17:37.359 one and a half so then I take out my
03:17:39.160 calculator and I say what's one and a
03:17:41.160 half time 60 which would be other way
03:17:44.279 around it' be 60 divid by 1 and a half
03:17:45.920 which is 45 okay so 45 weeks is how
03:17:53.000 long it's going to take us to take you
03:17:55.239 from 200 to 140 so you lose a pound and
03:17:57.399 a half a week it's going to take 45
03:17:59.080 weeks and so
03:18:01.600 six present
03:18:05.160 price in
03:18:07.680 relation to
03:18:09.560 goal so you say awesome so we currently
03:18:12.520 charge 99 bucks a week we can get you
03:18:14.640 there in 45 weeks which means it's
03:18:18.160 $500 and that means and for us I added a
03:18:20.880 a guarantee on the back end which which
03:18:22.560 said hey if you show up to the workouts
03:18:23.960 for next 45 weeks and you log your food
03:18:25.840 and you don't lose the weight I'll keep
03:18:27.160 working with you for free until you do
03:18:29.199 so that means this is the translation
03:18:30.840 this is the key part in the script so
03:18:32.199 that means when you pay this $4,500 it
03:18:34.319 means that you can count that weight for
03:18:36.080 good you can put it out of your mind you
03:18:38.040 pay me this money we're going to get
03:18:39.239 there one way or another As Long as You
03:18:40.600 Follow the steps you're going to follow
03:18:41.479 the steps right great and so here you're
03:18:46.399 trying to sell 99 bucks a month or or
03:18:48.319 whatever this would be 99 bucks a week
03:18:49.520 if if I was doing equivalent pricing all
03:18:51.800 right so this would be like a
03:18:52.960 semi-private
03:18:54.199 program but by positioning it this way
03:18:56.920 I'm not selling a membership anymore I'm
03:18:58.960 selling exactly what they want and
03:19:00.479 putting a price tag on it and saying you
03:19:02.239 want to get to 140 it's going to take
03:19:03.880 this long and I'll guarantee that you
03:19:05.800 that you'll get there provided you
03:19:07.080 follow these
03:19:09.120 steps and then they say wow that's
03:19:11.279 awesome you say well if you
03:19:15.439 want I can can save you a little bit of
03:19:17.359 money you want to save a little bit of
03:19:18.880 money and they're like yeah I want to
03:19:20.199 save a little bit of money well if you
03:19:21.640 prepay you can save 10% a
03:19:24.000 day so I can save you 450 bucks you want
03:19:27.600 to do that that's what most people do
03:19:29.479 great you want to you want to use the
03:19:30.880 card you have in
03:19:33.160 file done so that's that's the process
03:19:37.120 now I took this process and applied it
03:19:40.720 to a completely different service
03:19:42.199 business that we own that's a chain that
03:19:44.840 this is a little bit more Medical but
03:19:46.960 the concept still applied which is and
03:19:49.279 this is the key part is you have to
03:19:50.560 figure out for whatever it is that you
03:19:52.319 sell what the current is versus what the
03:19:55.439 desired is so if I were uh a painter all
03:20:00.640 right and I was painting houses sounds
03:20:02.319 crazy right say hey so you currently
03:20:05.000 have this thing you want a completely
03:20:08.439 painted house and so the like now for
03:20:11.720 them this is like more us do it for you
03:20:13.840 rather than uh self-service like I'm
03:20:15.359 going to have to like they you're not
03:20:18.160 painting your house and them helping you
03:20:19.399 so they're actually going to paint the
03:20:20.600 house so then we just try and think how
03:20:22.920 can we how can we how can we sell to
03:20:25.439 goal and break it into a price that we
03:20:27.640 tie to that and so it' be like okay so
03:20:30.160 we're going to need four coats of paint
03:20:31.920 and inste to take this period of time
03:20:33.640 and then at that point your your whole
03:20:35.199 house is going to be weatherproofed and
03:20:36.600 so that means that when you pay this
03:20:37.720 price that's what you're going to get by
03:20:39.640 this state and if we don't get it done
03:20:41.239 by that date I'm going to give you
03:20:43.239 this and that way we can relieve their
03:20:45.600 risk that it's not going to happen
03:20:46.640 happen and we tie the purchase to the
03:20:48.760 outcome so this particular business when
03:20:51.120 I bought it or bought into it
03:20:54.160 um it was a business that they had
03:20:57.000 really good lead gen and they have a
03:20:59.640 good product but they didn't have good
03:21:01.760 packaging and I saw the opportunity
03:21:04.760 because I knew that if I installed my
03:21:06.520 sales process into their business I
03:21:09.000 could make it make a lot more money and
03:21:11.120 so if you have the opportunity to like
03:21:12.479 4X a business without opening new
03:21:14.640 locations you do that and so that's more
03:21:17.359 or less what we did so I actually wrote
03:21:18.760 down the new sales process took me four
03:21:20.359 hours so I wrote down the new sales
03:21:22.080 process and then I presented to the
03:21:23.359 management team and they were like wow
03:21:26.000 this is the most valuable thing we've
03:21:27.080 ever had happen to our business and I
03:21:28.319 said great so let me know when you do it
03:21:30.160 across all the locations and let's keep
03:21:32.000 buying and opening new ones and so 18
03:21:34.279 months later we have 32 locations and
03:21:35.920 the recurring Revenue in that time
03:21:37.520 period has gone up and the average
03:21:39.880 revenue per customer went from
03:21:44.720 $200 to $800
03:21:48.160 from this one process and that was
03:21:50.040 because before this they were selling
03:21:51.720 one-off transactions they were saying
03:21:53.399 hey we'll do this service for you so
03:21:55.040 think of it like botox or we're going to
03:21:56.520 do filler or we're going to do something
03:21:59.239 this one time and so rather than just
03:22:01.479 say sure give us a call when you want it
03:22:04.080 again which is pretty much what the
03:22:05.279 process was before this I say hey you
03:22:08.399 want to look a certain way you're not
03:22:09.800 here because you want filler you're here
03:22:11.080 because you want to look a certain way
03:22:12.560 so if I show this chart to you of faces
03:22:15.359 and filler densities
03:22:17.840 where where do you see yourself on here
03:22:20.319 currently now you let them self-identify
03:22:22.120 you can't be like look VI you're ugly
03:22:23.560 can't say that so you got to say where
03:22:25.600 are you on this chart and then they say
03:22:27.279 this now in the weight loss sale I got
03:22:28.680 them to step on the scale the scale
03:22:29.840 called you fat not me all right so maybe
03:22:32.000 just point to the third party not me so
03:22:34.520 so so you get them to pick how ugly they
03:22:36.479 are all right and then you say how
03:22:38.520 pretty do you want to be now everyone's
03:22:39.800 going to say I want to be super pretty
03:22:41.040 but here's the beautiful thing when they
03:22:42.880 pick how pretty they want to be they're
03:22:44.640 the one who set the goal and that means
03:22:46.640 The price came from them and you know
03:22:48.520 where I picked this up was yogurt stores
03:22:51.160 so one of the things I thought was
03:22:52.239 genius about like Yogurt Land and things
03:22:54.279 like that was if if you go to a store
03:22:56.920 and then they fill up your stuff behind
03:22:58.199 the counter and then they say hey it's
03:22:59.800 eight bucks you're like man what the
03:23:01.479 hell this place is so expensive but if
03:23:03.279 they give you the cup and you fill it up
03:23:05.600 and you put it on the scale you're like
03:23:07.000 man I'm a fat ass same pricing but
03:23:10.600 because I had control over what I picked
03:23:13.520 I'm the one who's responsible for the
03:23:14.920 decision and so by saying where are you
03:23:17.120 on this chart and again this is where
03:23:19.120 the magic happens I say current desired
03:23:21.120 that's where the thinking behind how I'm
03:23:23.319 going to structure a sale is where like
03:23:25.359 that's where the that's where the
03:23:26.160 experience that's where the expertise
03:23:27.279 that's where it comes in this is the
03:23:29.120 process and hopefully you guys can take
03:23:31.199 this for your business and think like
03:23:32.760 okay what's current what do they really
03:23:34.920 want they're not buying lip filler
03:23:36.319 they're not buying a painted house
03:23:38.600 they're buying an image in their mind of
03:23:40.479 what they want that house to signify or
03:23:41.760 what it means to them and this lady is
03:23:44.359 not buying filler she's trying to buy a
03:23:45.720 certain look she wants people to think
03:23:47.279 about her a certain way that she want
03:23:48.800 when people walk when she walks in the
03:23:49.760 room she wants guys to turn their heads
03:23:50.880 though cuz she's probably getting a
03:23:51.600 little older they're not turning their
03:23:53.160 heads as much and she still misses that
03:23:55.080 and she pay anything to get that so say
03:23:57.279 you're ugly now how pretty do you want
03:23:58.800 to be we say cool so for us to get you
03:24:00.960 from here to here it's going to take us
03:24:03.560 45 weeks it's going to take us Botox
03:24:05.840 filler and you know plastic surgery
03:24:08.520 whatever we're going to have to hit you
03:24:09.520 with a pretty shovel and bring you back
03:24:11.199 to life all right we're going to have to
03:24:12.600 do this and it's going to take this many
03:24:13.920 weeks for us to reverse this level of
03:24:15.319 Aging or at least take these cow feed
03:24:17.040 out or whatever it is and so we tie
03:24:19.239 where you're at to where you want to go
03:24:20.920 and then our solution is only the
03:24:22.640 vehicle that delivers this outcome and
03:24:25.160 so that is the moment that you present
03:24:27.000 the price because they picked where they
03:24:29.439 were where they want to go and then you
03:24:31.080 as the expert explain the path to
03:24:32.960 getting there so they pick the before
03:24:34.920 and after and you just use your
03:24:36.399 expertise of this is what we found best
03:24:37.840 to get people to hear Who start where
03:24:39.600 you're at and so we found out that this
03:24:42.840 opportunity existed within this
03:24:44.399 particular business because I had my
03:24:45.720 sales director your secret shop them so
03:24:47.279 mind you this is Brick and mor chain we
03:24:48.960 have a lot of locations so we could
03:24:50.279 sneak our way in it's harder if you have
03:24:51.800 like a you know four sales guys who do
03:24:53.800 all the sales they'll just tell the
03:24:54.720 owner right so we wanted a secret shop
03:24:56.520 before we actually completed the
03:24:57.640 investment and so uh when he went in he
03:25:00.520 was I asked him so I went through this
03:25:01.960 checklist I was like okay so did they
03:25:03.720 give you some sort of pre-sale question
03:25:04.920 he was like no I was like okay great I
03:25:08.160 like did you did they ask you for your
03:25:09.279 credit card or did they ask you for your
03:25:10.439 information or anything before you got
03:25:11.880 the service and he was like No And I was
03:25:13.439 like fantastic what else what else El
03:25:16.439 did they do it's like did they have you
03:25:17.840 set you know pick uh where you're at and
03:25:19.760 where what your goal is he said yeah
03:25:21.760 they did have me uh pick where I was at
03:25:23.960 but not where I wanted to go so they
03:25:25.720 just had him pick okay how ugly are you
03:25:27.520 and he's like okay now again not
03:25:29.279 completely flawed I want to be really
03:25:30.600 clear here like this is a at 14
03:25:32.720 locations they're not they're not idiots
03:25:34.279 they had the pain we agitated the pain
03:25:35.800 they said listen this is how ugly you
03:25:37.319 are on this scale that we invented and
03:25:39.479 you're here you're a seven ugly great so
03:25:42.199 he checked this but he didn't get to say
03:25:44.160 where he wanted to be so then from there
03:25:46.880 he just went right into the service and
03:25:49.439 then when he came out he just gave them
03:25:51.960 the card to pay for the service and that
03:25:54.439 was it and he just walked out the door
03:25:56.800 and I was like wait so they didn't they
03:25:58.319 didn't actually like ask you to buy a
03:26:00.640 package or get into some membership or
03:26:02.520 anything and he's like well they tried
03:26:04.160 to upsell me this one product at one
03:26:05.760 point but this was the price point and
03:26:07.720 the price point was like 20 bucks or
03:26:09.359 something and I knew what the average
03:26:10.800 customer's worth which was like 200 at
03:26:12.479 the time I was like that's like by the
03:26:15.160 way if you're going to do upsell you
03:26:16.680 want the price point to usually be
03:26:18.199 usually be five times more than the
03:26:20.439 current price because if you get 20% of
03:26:22.520 people so customers are fractal so we're
03:26:24.720 going to go into a little side quest
03:26:25.800 here but it'll be worth it for you since
03:26:26.840 we're talking about
03:26:29.560 sales so you've heard of 8020 right so
03:26:32.040 You' got a 100 people right the top 20%
03:26:35.479 you've got the 80 underneath
03:26:38.520 right these are the people 8020 have
03:26:41.520 five times the spending power of these
03:26:43.359 people and so because of that if you get
03:26:45.600 20% of people to buy something that's
03:26:47.840 five times as expensive so let's say my
03:26:49.800 current thing is
03:26:51.239 $11,000 if I'm going to have an upsell I
03:26:53.760 want my upsell to be
03:26:55.479 $5,000 because if 20% take it then it's
03:26:58.080 20% time 5,000 which means I add $1,000
03:27:01.840 to my average ticket so I go from $2,000
03:27:04.720 or sry $1,000 per customer to
03:27:08.760 $2,000 per
03:27:11.000 customer and so when I heard that their
03:27:13.199 upso was 10% it'd be like having a up be
03:27:16.720 like my upsell is 100 bucks okay fine
03:27:19.800 maybe 20% take that so I I go from a
03:27:22.080 th000 to
03:27:23.560 1,020 who cares like what's like why
03:27:26.840 bother right and fundamentally again
03:27:30.439 smart business owners and they were
03:27:32.439 upselling product which means there's no
03:27:33.600 real delivery in a brick and mor service
03:27:35.000 business so they could just hand the
03:27:35.880 product make the money and I think they
03:27:38.040 were using it more for commissions for
03:27:39.760 their staff to increase the average pay
03:27:41.560 which a different objective entirely and
03:27:43.520 totally fine but I was only looking at
03:27:45.960 this from how do I take customers who
03:27:47.560 are worth $200 and make them my goal is
03:27:49.960 to get them worth a th000 currently it's
03:27:51.199 $800 I'm going to keep getting there
03:27:52.760 until we get to 1,000 but I think that
03:27:54.479 we can get it to a thousand and
03:27:56.920 so we secret shop them number
03:28:00.080 one which by the way if you have a team
03:28:03.319 of people who are currently selling your
03:28:05.160 stuff secret shop them and then be
03:28:08.359 horrified by what you listen to on the
03:28:10.239 phone or what you see in person because
03:28:12.000 you have this beautiful idea of what you
03:28:14.040 think your sales process is and it's a
03:28:15.800 night nightmare it's an absolute
03:28:17.640 nightmare if they remember half of it
03:28:19.160 you'll be stoked and so if you run in an
03:28:21.479 environment especially in a in a lower
03:28:23.080 wage environment so if you're brick and
03:28:24.319 mortar you have a chain of of locations
03:28:26.160 and you have to take low skill labor and
03:28:27.960 teach them a sales process you've like
03:28:30.800 the the expertise in sales comes down to
03:28:33.439 how easy and simple you can make the
03:28:36.319 process and so that comes down to like
03:28:37.960 can I automate parts of the p uh the
03:28:40.160 point of sale so that they can't move
03:28:42.640 forward without doing this checkbox
03:28:44.439 right and by doing this checkbox they
03:28:45.760 have to ask the question so it forces
03:28:47.359 script adherence now training sales not
03:28:50.720 into this video but you want to
03:28:52.080 basically repeat the process over and
03:28:53.720 over and over until they're sick of it
03:28:55.439 until they say like yes Mom would you
03:28:57.439 like to have do you have your credit you
03:28:58.960 want to use the credit card on on file
03:29:00.399 like until they're saying it like they
03:29:01.920 could they can breathe it they can think
03:29:03.680 they can say without thinking about it
03:29:05.319 that's when you've maybe just started to
03:29:07.960 have a a team that's that's well trained
03:29:09.960 now that we finished these seven uh
03:29:11.279 pieces of the diagnostic I want to add
03:29:12.720 one more bonus because you're like wait
03:29:13.760 a second so where's the where's the
03:29:15.199 recurring Revenue great observation
03:29:17.279 Andrew okay so so number eight is
03:29:21.600 transition to recurring all right I
03:29:24.080 remember this I'll give you two separate
03:29:25.439 stories that'll drive this home so A
03:29:26.960 friend of mine has a a recurring
03:29:29.359 membership that he sells and he sells it
03:29:32.239 at uh I think he was sell at 300 bucks a
03:29:33.760 month and he couldn't get people stick
03:29:34.800 past three months and so he tried all
03:29:37.560 these different gimmicks and things and
03:29:39.239 he just couldn't crack three months of
03:29:40.960 LTV now that could have been a pricing
03:29:42.479 issue whatever so this is what he did he
03:29:45.520 stops selling it at $300 a month month
03:29:47.600 to month and started selling as a
03:29:49.239 $10,000 program with 36 Monon of
03:29:51.920 Interest
03:29:53.199 refinancing and so when people bought
03:29:55.439 they were buying a $10,000 price point
03:29:57.199 but they got an amazing payment plan and
03:29:59.960 so he didn't change anything about what
03:30:01.560 he sold but that took his average
03:30:04.239 customer from 3 months to eight months
03:30:06.920 so we're talking about a $900 so three
03:30:08.960 times 300 to 8 * 300 2,400 that kind of
03:30:12.720 change in a business life-changing in
03:30:14.640 terms of how much money you can make the
03:30:16.000 second one was I had a different friend
03:30:17.680 who had a continuity program uh he was
03:30:19.560 an uh agency and what he did was he
03:30:22.359 realized he had churn in his business
03:30:24.239 and so he said you know people are way
03:30:25.760 less likely to turn out of a payment
03:30:27.080 plan same as the other one than they are
03:30:28.960 out of a monthly recurring Revenue
03:30:30.239 strain and so what you call it to the
03:30:32.800 customer can affect the likelihood that
03:30:35.439 they pay but as far as the business is
03:30:37.960 concerned you just want payments that
03:30:39.640 are regular and all you do to take a
03:30:42.479 program and take it from from a payment
03:30:45.479 plan to to recurring in terms of what
03:30:47.160 how it actually looks and feels is you
03:30:48.840 just put an automatic recurring at the
03:30:50.560 end of the program and so when someone
03:30:52.479 buys this big thing and you make a
03:30:54.439 payment plan and then it recurs into the
03:30:56.199 exact same price as the payment plan you
03:30:58.199 just move the pieces around but the
03:30:59.880 likely they stick is way higher and so
03:31:01.760 that's exactly what we did as the last
03:31:03.960 step in the diagnostic sales process and
03:31:05.560 I wanted to highlight this point for you
03:31:07.359 because I've done it in every business
03:31:09.120 and so we give someone the option to
03:31:10.720 prepay you can give if you want a little
03:31:12.880 bit more aggressive you get 20% off if
03:31:14.600 they prepaid today if you want to have
03:31:16.800 one step down below that which is what I
03:31:18.239 like to do you give them 10% off if they
03:31:20.640 do half down and then make the rest his
03:31:22.560 payments and if they still can't do that
03:31:24.720 then I take the whole thing and I spread
03:31:26.640 it over let's say our 45 weeks and so
03:31:29.520 I'd say okay it's 99 bucks a week 99 a
03:31:31.760 week and there you go now they go from
03:31:34.120 99 a week to 80 bucks a week if they
03:31:37.040 prepay the whole thing and they go from
03:31:39.479 99 bucks a week to 90 a week if they
03:31:42.239 prepay half and here's the key part is
03:31:46.080 that when we present the price you
03:31:48.279 present it at the highest rate so you
03:31:50.800 present it at the payment plan let me
03:31:52.319 walk I'll walk you through this CU I
03:31:53.319 think it's important well I'm going to
03:31:54.279 put it here and so I don't have to flip
03:31:55.680 screens for you all right so you have
03:31:58.279 your full boat I'll say full interest
03:32:02.960 price so for us in our example is 4500
03:32:05.800 bucks all right 45 weeks time 99 roughly
03:32:08.560 all right so this is our full boat price
03:32:10.560 we have our prepayment
03:32:13.319 discount in full which is-
03:32:16.439 % all right so for us it's going to be
03:32:19.239 minus what is that 900 yeah 900 from
03:32:21.920 there so that's 5600 sorry other way uh
03:32:24.800 3600
03:32:26.600 3600 if they do half
03:32:30.560 down you say I'll let you save uh 450
03:32:34.080 bucks so 10% so 40 five Z all right so
03:32:37.640 this is
03:32:38.479 10% minus 10% that's- 20% now the reason
03:32:42.399 this is so important is think about the
03:32:43.920 alternative think about and this is what
03:32:45.960 most people do so listen to me Andrew
03:32:47.880 most people do this they present the
03:32:50.600 price is
03:32:51.800 $3,600 and then they say oh well we have
03:32:54.160 payment plans that we have interest on
03:32:56.520 and so we do we do have 10% interest if
03:32:58.840 you can put half down and we have 20%
03:33:01.160 interest if you put uh nothing down and
03:33:04.359 you just go onto a straight payment plan
03:33:06.840 well which one would you rather buy if
03:33:08.760 on one hand you have a $4,500 price tank
03:33:11.120 which anchors you high and you say or
03:33:13.439 you can get a benefit for prepaying
03:33:14.840 today rather than you think about 3600
03:33:17.560 you're considering it and then they say
03:33:18.840 oh it's even more even though you're
03:33:20.479 just considering this Peg guess what you
03:33:22.840 have to pay way more now be because you
03:33:24.840 can't afford it you have to pay
03:33:27.040 more Banks do it all the time and guess
03:33:29.319 what everyone hates Banks so if banks
03:33:31.120 want to fix their process Mr Bank maybe
03:33:32.600 this will work who knows anyway point is
03:33:34.160 is that this is how you present the
03:33:35.319 price because you get the benefit of a
03:33:36.479 price anchor and you get to be the good
03:33:39.359 guy for getting them to pay upfront
03:33:41.640 rather than the bad guy for them not
03:33:43.560 being able to so we're going to we're
03:33:45.359 going to go through step eight in uh in
03:33:47.600 the more
03:33:48.840 transition uh process for the sale and
03:33:51.800 so I want to just walk you through step
03:33:53.520 downs and so this is super important to
03:33:55.680 understand from a sales perspective so
03:33:56.760 we'll call this
03:33:57.960 sales step downs and uh this is by the
03:34:00.960 way a preview for my next book coming
03:34:03.520 out $100
03:34:04.520 million yeah anyways so so sales step
03:34:07.880 Downs is one of the things that we have
03:34:09.080 so obviously the first thing we're going
03:34:10.279 to present is a prepayment all right
03:34:11.680 which is painful today prepay yay by the
03:34:14.239 way you've probably noticed from any of
03:34:15.920 my content I don't say paidon fools and
03:34:18.199 that's because that's a that's a
03:34:20.080 Salesman term not a customer benefit if
03:34:23.120 you prepaid you get a benefit whereas
03:34:24.880 paidon full is like I got all the cash
03:34:26.920 to front good for me and so I have
03:34:29.359 trained myself because I used to say
03:34:30.760 paidon fools pipis P you know whatevers
03:34:32.760 pifs like all of that stuff I used to do
03:34:34.560 as a sales team sales leader and then I
03:34:36.399 also heard my team saying that to
03:34:37.960 customers like hey if you want to pay in
03:34:39.160 full today like it's just like kind of
03:34:41.840 gross and so I prefer to say like hey we
03:34:44.120 have a prepayment discount and so
03:34:45.880 training that just little Pro tip for
03:34:47.840 you so number one is prepay number two
03:34:50.680 is we do
03:34:53.600 discount uh with
03:34:56.239 partial so this is the half down
03:34:59.680 oops half
03:35:02.520 down here you can also do in-house well
03:35:05.399 this is whatever sorry this is credit
03:35:06.680 card or third
03:35:08.479 party so if you have like most most
03:35:12.319 businesses that sell legitimate Services
03:35:13.960 have third-party financing solution that
03:35:16.120 already exist and so I promise you there
03:35:18.880 is a banker somewhere who started a
03:35:20.760 business to service this Emerging Market
03:35:22.520 of whatever it is that you do who says
03:35:24.399 I'll bet you I can help Finance
03:35:25.640 transactions now the prices they charge
03:35:28.199 for that financing will differ based on
03:35:30.439 how risky your businesses and so like
03:35:33.120 there's financing for casinos like if
03:35:36.120 you want to get if you want to get a
03:35:37.239 loan to go gamble more like there's
03:35:39.080 financing for that but they will charge
03:35:40.800 you a lot of money right and so like
03:35:42.840 that being the extreme on the other hand
03:35:44.080 if you want to finance a house there's
03:35:45.239 obviously huge mortgage industry and so
03:35:47.000 from every step in between there are
03:35:48.520 Partners who will step in as third party
03:35:50.640 and take on that risk for you for a
03:35:52.359 price and so I prefer can I get the
03:35:54.920 prepayment because it's easiest and
03:35:56.239 fastest if not I usually have a third
03:35:58.120 party that I set up so that my customers
03:36:00.760 can get financing if we don't move past
03:36:02.800 either of these two things then I try to
03:36:04.439 go with a partial with some level of
03:36:06.279 discount not as much as here but a
03:36:08.000 little bit and if they still say
03:36:11.040 no then I go for continuity
03:36:16.399 which is why don't we just make a
03:36:17.520 payment plan on the thing and in this
03:36:19.279 particular business because what they
03:36:20.479 were doing before was simply rebooking
03:36:22.319 people for another session of
03:36:24.640 service we just had this be the
03:36:26.640 automatic like everyone gets rebooked
03:36:28.399 and that would became that became an
03:36:29.960 internal saying like I like having
03:36:31.560 mantras uh within sales teams which is
03:36:34.239 like everyone buys something like
03:36:36.160 everyone buys something there's no
03:36:37.920 reason someone should not buy something
03:36:40.120 and so sure we'll get them a prepay
03:36:41.800 maybe a partial okay fine we'll do a
03:36:43.479 payment plan that's whatever call it you
03:36:45.359 know 250 uh times four great that's our
03:36:48.239 th000 that's our th000 plan that we're
03:36:50.960 getting people to buy and you pay 250
03:36:52.840 today and then three more times and you
03:36:54.520 can do it every other month if it's a
03:36:55.960 more uh intermittent service whatever
03:36:58.199 just match the payments to when they get
03:37:00.880 delivery and then finally if they're
03:37:02.640 like well I can't do any of those things
03:37:03.840 and like cool let's just let's just book
03:37:05.439 the next time you want to come in that's
03:37:07.359 it and so this is the final of the
03:37:09.359 process in terms of in terms of the step
03:37:11.720 Downs that we might offer someone we
03:37:13.319 just walk through this whole process and
03:37:14.560 you're like wow maybe that's a l lot of
03:37:15.680 work I have to use my brain power but
03:37:17.000 welcome to business but let me tell you
03:37:19.080 why it's worth it so these are the
03:37:21.720 actual stats and I put the numbers
03:37:22.800 without the names to keep it nice open
03:37:24.319 loop for you so number one is that they
03:37:26.560 had 9% of Revenue uh that was recurring
03:37:29.319 within this product line all right so
03:37:31.279 they 9% that was occurring after we
03:37:33.560 implemented this
03:37:35.319 process
03:37:37.319 60% they took this 9% to 60% of this
03:37:40.279 product line within the company so
03:37:42.680 awesome number two they had basically no
03:37:47.520 membership at all because they just
03:37:49.199 weren't it wasn't even an option not
03:37:51.199 really and we were to push that to 30
03:37:54.080 that's a 30
03:37:56.399 30% into memberships this included
03:37:59.640 payment plans this is just
03:38:02.000 memberships and then we went from
03:38:04.160 getting one additional extra visit on
03:38:06.319 average per person meaning two to
03:38:08.560 getting 4 to
03:38:10.479 six visits per customer by introducing
03:38:14.080 this sales process from a money
03:38:16.239 perspective we went from $20,000 when we
03:38:19.439 uh bought the business so mind you this
03:38:21.680 business made a lot more money than this
03:38:24.000 single product line or this service line
03:38:26.080 but this is where I wanted to invest my
03:38:28.160 time because I thought there was a huge
03:38:29.399 opportunity here because I saw from the
03:38:31.080 secret shopper from the constraints I
03:38:32.640 thought this was a big area of attack
03:38:34.319 and so they only do 20,000 a month which
03:38:35.920 business de sizes not a lot and then
03:38:38.680 however many have been dots this later
03:38:41.319 over
03:38:43.120 250,000 per month in in
03:38:46.279 added and it continues to grow and this
03:38:49.439 compounds and that's the that's the
03:38:50.880 beauty of this type of sales process and
03:38:53.000 repackaging of what someone already
03:38:54.520 sells and so we went from 9 to 60 0 to
03:38:57.439 30% on memberships from one visit to
03:38:59.199 four to six visits and from 20 to
03:39:01.080 250,000 so we more than 10x the
03:39:03.399 recurring revenue of this business by
03:39:05.080 following a diagnostic process rather
03:39:07.080 than just selling some traditional
03:39:08.359 one-off thing the first thing you have
03:39:09.680 to learn how to do is how to sell the
03:39:11.520 second thing you have to learn how to do
03:39:12.880 is get someone else to sell for you and
03:39:14.880 so in this video I break down how he
03:39:16.239 scaled a new sales department from 0 to
03:39:18.479 40 sales reps doing 5 million plus per
03:39:21.359 month in sales within 90 days but before
03:39:24.520 I explain the $21.6 million increase let
03:39:26.840 me kind of give you some context on this
03:39:28.160 business and where it was in the life
03:39:29.319 cycle we brought in Mercenaries so when
03:39:32.399 I say mercenaries I mean an outsourced
03:39:34.439 sales team the founder of the business
03:39:35.960 had never been in sales at all he'd
03:39:38.439 never got on the phone he' never done
03:39:39.640 door Todo he never done anything related
03:39:41.319 to getting a stranger to give him money
03:39:42.560 one-on-one I thought it was too risky to
03:39:45.439 try and have somebody who's completely
03:39:47.439 new to it try and start from scratch and
03:39:50.040 so I called somebody in my network and I
03:39:51.760 said hey do you want to make a bunch of
03:39:53.000 money and he said yes can you round up
03:39:56.040 some of your guys and start taking
03:39:57.840 college for this company that I have and
03:39:59.399 so they started taking sales and we
03:40:01.199 started making more money we have a w
03:40:03.600 money up W fantastic and in a second
03:40:06.319 I'll walk you through all the statistics
03:40:08.120 of what the mercenaries and the ouse
03:40:09.760 team did which then led us to a fully
03:40:12.760 in-house team now as you can imagine
03:40:15.319 imagine going from zero sales guys to 40
03:40:18.640 sales guys in a fresh company is hard
03:40:20.880 but let me explain some of the problems
03:40:22.279 with the mercenaries and then I'll walk
03:40:24.000 you through the actual stats so there
03:40:25.439 were three main problems with the
03:40:26.880 mercenaries all right problem number one
03:40:29.680 is that we were giving them 20% of the
03:40:31.840 revenue all right now this is something
03:40:34.520 that I was vehemently against to be very
03:40:37.479 honest with you in this particular
03:40:39.080 company I was in a minority position I
03:40:40.720 said it's ultimately your call I was
03:40:42.080 like but I would not do it at this
03:40:43.319 percentage they decided to move forward
03:40:44.800 with it anyways and hey we made money
03:40:46.279 there was a w there but it was a problem
03:40:48.279 20% of Revenue coming in is a big
03:40:50.640 [ __ ] check the sales team company was
03:40:52.560 arguing we can't get the top guys to
03:40:54.720 sell unless we give them a really big
03:40:56.279 rip that's sales slang big commission so
03:40:58.720 we had to give them 20% of the revenue
03:41:01.160 that they collected as commission to The
03:41:03.040 Mercenaries team the ouse sales team the
03:41:05.439 second problem that came
03:41:07.080 up is related to Performance they were
03:41:10.199 getting less than 30% of people to
03:41:12.840 ascend meaning people who buy the first
03:41:14.920 thing to buy the next thing and we
03:41:17.199 wanted it to be higher than that or I
03:41:18.680 believe that it should be higher than
03:41:20.160 that we're paying a lot and we're not
03:41:22.359 getting as much out as we want the third
03:41:24.359 problem with the ouse sales team and
03:41:25.920 this is one that I think more long-term
03:41:27.600 about because I'm investor in the
03:41:28.640 business
03:41:30.680 is is the sellability and Enterprise
03:41:33.279 value of the business meaning in the
03:41:35.319 future we'd like to sell the company at
03:41:37.080 some point probably and even if you
03:41:38.880 don't want to sell a business creating a
03:41:40.520 sellable business still makes the
03:41:42.159 business more valuable and so if you can
03:41:44.399 make a business more Val Val to a
03:41:45.640 stranger it also becomes more valuable
03:41:47.239 to you if you have a outsourced sales
03:41:49.279 team something that exists outside of
03:41:51.080 the business that's responsible for 203
03:41:53.479 40% of the revenue in the business then
03:41:55.359 that could be a material issue that's
03:41:57.600 why we decided to look at these three
03:41:59.399 things and say all right let's see if we
03:42:01.760 can move this in house I'm going to walk
03:42:03.359 you through first the funnel kind of
03:42:05.479 before and after and then I'll walk you
03:42:07.120 through the process that we did to fix
03:42:08.680 it or swap it over that resulted in the
03:42:11.159 $21.6 million increase in profit not
03:42:13.800 Revenue profit the way that this process
03:42:16.080 was structured is we had a two call set
03:42:18.000 up we've got a percentage of people who
03:42:20.000 schedule a call a percentage of people
03:42:22.000 who show to the call and then schedule
03:42:24.560 the next thing then they have to show to
03:42:27.120 the next thing and they go to the next
03:42:29.880 call and then do they buy so let me walk
03:42:32.880 you through the stats here because
03:42:34.359 everyone who bought the product had a
03:42:35.960 first call that they wanted to attend
03:42:37.680 100% of people were scheduled to show up
03:42:40.640 for this call with the Outsource sales
03:42:42.439 team we had
03:42:43.600 74% of people are actually showing for
03:42:46.199 the call once they got on the call we're
03:42:48.720 able to get
03:42:51.080 53% to schedule the follow-up call and
03:42:54.399 so some people call this a qualification
03:42:56.279 call which is if you're going to sell
03:42:57.880 something else you want to make sure the
03:42:59.279 person actually fits for the thing you
03:43:00.479 sell makes sense right you want to make
03:43:02.159 sure they have the problem to solve and
03:43:03.199 the money to spend with the 53% the
03:43:06.319 Outsource team wanted to only give their
03:43:08.159 closers because he's trying to optimize
03:43:09.840 for his dollars per hour for his team
03:43:12.080 only the easiest closes so they weren't
03:43:14.279 willing to take call they weren't
03:43:15.720 already sure were going to close all
03:43:17.800 right so because of that they're only
03:43:19.000 passing 53% or almost half to the next
03:43:22.040 call now again this is just scheduling
03:43:23.960 now from here we had 63% showing up to
03:43:27.399 call two so this is call one this is
03:43:30.560 call two now this is the close call this
03:43:33.640 is the set call this is the close so
03:43:35.279 I'll just put set this is close so the
03:43:38.600 last box we got to fill in here is how
03:43:40.239 many people were they actually selling
03:43:41.840 all right and they were getting 80% of
03:43:43.800 people who show go to the second call
03:43:46.600 the closed call to buy all right and so
03:43:49.720 that is where money came out the other
03:43:51.520 side hooray so let's walk through the
03:43:53.880 math as if a 100 people bought the
03:43:55.960 product so if 100 people bought the
03:43:57.920 product then it means that we'd have 74
03:44:00.720 74% of 100 74 people who would show up
03:44:03.920 to this first call now of the 74 people
03:44:07.800 53% so about 37 of them would then
03:44:11.920 schedule for the second call of the 37
03:44:15.199 people who scheduled for the second call
03:44:16.880 we're going to have 22 so 63% 22 of them
03:44:21.000 are actually going to show up to this
03:44:22.439 close call now 80% of these 22 are going
03:44:26.239 to close which means we'd have about 20
03:44:29.159 sales or
03:44:31.760 20% of that front end that ascends now
03:44:34.239 remember I said at the very beginning
03:44:35.560 one of the
03:44:38.439 problems is that we wanted it to be
03:44:40.359 closer to 30 this is the issue and so I
03:44:42.960 want to be very clear a big part of this
03:44:44.840 was was the price point we were selling
03:44:46.159 at and the fact that we were selling
03:44:47.640 people who are already customers we're
03:44:49.680 not selling cold traffic here we're
03:44:51.600 selling people who already bought this
03:44:53.159 already demonstrated an interest and
03:44:54.319 we're saying do you want more help with
03:44:55.399 that thing so we thought it should be
03:44:57.080 much higher so there's five steps that
03:44:58.960 we broke down that we had to do to go
03:45:01.000 from out ofh housee team mercenaries to
03:45:03.880 in-house sales team and the first one
03:45:06.040 started with hiring a director now right
03:45:08.720 off the BET let me explain our thinking
03:45:10.000 process before I explain who we were
03:45:12.080 looking for and how we found them cuz
03:45:13.600 listen you don't want to hire 40 people
03:45:15.000 people right you were thinking okay I
03:45:16.640 want to hire one person who can then
03:45:19.000 hire 40
03:45:21.520 people times a lot more circles right
03:45:23.800 it's even long to write it out all right
03:45:26.159 it's an old investor saying which is
03:45:27.720 hire one to hire 10 we're going to hire
03:45:29.520 the one person not the 40 that's the
03:45:31.279 main decision after that what we're
03:45:33.120 looking for is who who are we looking
03:45:35.239 for what do they look like and then how
03:45:38.279 are we going to find them okay now from
03:45:40.399 a who perspective we wanted someone who
03:45:42.479 had been there done that
03:45:45.239 which means specifically somebody who
03:45:46.680 sold this type of product in this type
03:45:48.800 of industry and ideally scaled a big
03:45:51.760 team and knows how to coach up new
03:45:53.960 salespeople so that's what been there
03:45:55.960 means for us for this particular role
03:45:58.399 the next thing is you want the person to
03:46:00.080 be metric driven so one of the easiest
03:46:02.720 ways that you can measure someone's
03:46:04.080 Proficiency in any skills this little
03:46:05.520 Pro tip the quality and quantity of
03:46:07.840 metrics that someone explains about how
03:46:10.520 they do their job is directly correlated
03:46:12.920 with how good they are at the job and so
03:46:15.399 if someone's like hey I'm an amazing HR
03:46:18.159 person and I say cool what metrics do
03:46:20.359 you track and they're like well the
03:46:22.880 happiness of the team and I'd be like
03:46:24.720 what else do you track how many
03:46:26.000 complaints I get on payroll I'd be like
03:46:28.000 okay what else do you track the order
03:46:29.680 that they tell me the metrics they're
03:46:30.880 looking at and what they track is going
03:46:32.720 to tell me what they care about what
03:46:34.159 they pay attention to and their level of
03:46:36.199 expertise now on the flip side if
03:46:37.880 someone says hey I like to take
03:46:39.720 companies from on average a 45-day time
03:46:41.760 to fill to 20-day time to fill because
03:46:43.640 we know that every day that company
03:46:45.239 doesn't have something they need they're
03:46:46.319 losing money there's opportunity cost of
03:46:48.080 Revenue they should be making by not
03:46:49.319 having them this is really interesting
03:46:50.720 because they're connecting their metrics
03:46:52.560 to the company's revenue and so how
03:46:54.279 people talk about the metrics and which
03:46:56.239 metc they track and how they connect
03:46:57.640 those with how it makes the company more
03:46:58.920 money will show you how good they are
03:47:00.760 what they do the third one is just kind
03:47:02.439 of the I would say
03:47:04.359 demeanor now I've hired a lot of sales
03:47:07.239 people and sales directors in my life
03:47:08.760 and the personality of a sales leader is
03:47:12.920 usually not the same as the personality
03:47:15.359 of a sales killer now there are some
03:47:17.040 superstars who can do both but it's
03:47:19.199 rarer often times the demeanor of sales
03:47:21.960 directors is a little bit more even
03:47:23.359 killed usually more humble very servant
03:47:25.840 oriented they have to be people people
03:47:28.279 they have to be the type of person who
03:47:29.479 wants to pour into the team and loves
03:47:32.120 watching someone improve their skill set
03:47:34.199 and can repeat the same directions over
03:47:36.560 and over and over again without losing
03:47:38.399 enthusiasm that's who you want you want
03:47:40.239 somebody who's like a Energizer Bunny of
03:47:42.840 of Positive Vibes because for the most
03:47:44.560 part sales director is just Performance
03:47:46.920 Management they manage the culture of
03:47:48.399 the team like the output of the entire
03:47:50.439 team is the direct function of the sales
03:47:52.640 director and so if you think about this
03:47:54.080 like on a on a football team or
03:47:55.520 something you can switch the coaches and
03:47:57.000 all of a sudden the whole team does way
03:47:58.159 better it's because the coach drives the
03:48:00.600 culture in the team that drives the
03:48:02.279 performance and the output and so that
03:48:04.040 is what they are responsible for and so
03:48:05.960 if they don't have values everything
03:48:08.040 else that comes from the team is going
03:48:09.359 to be a diluted version of them now we
03:48:11.439 go to the how you're like okay well that
03:48:12.640 sounds like an amazing unicorn Alex how
03:48:14.399 do you find that person who's going to
03:48:15.720 replace this well I personally have a
03:48:18.199 relatively large network of salespeople
03:48:20.040 and so one of the big things here is
03:48:22.120 that you can either this is the core 4
03:48:24.880 by the way you can do
03:48:26.880 Outreach which means you reach out to
03:48:29.000 strangers who you think might fit the
03:48:31.359 role you can run ads so you run ads to
03:48:34.600 go get more people content you can also
03:48:37.279 do recruiter I've used all of these all
03:48:39.680 right so there there's pros and cons to
03:48:40.840 each of them but what I will do is I'm
03:48:42.439 going to cross out two of these early
03:48:43.800 for most of you most people think that
03:48:46.080 you can run ads for these types of roles
03:48:48.000 the reality is usually no the higher the
03:48:50.479 role is the better the person is the
03:48:53.040 less likely they're going to respond to
03:48:54.319 an ad cuz think about it an amazing
03:48:56.279 sales director is always going to have a
03:48:58.479 job and always going to be making good
03:49:00.199 money now they might not like their job
03:49:01.520 as much as they they they could but
03:49:04.399 they're going to keep making money and
03:49:06.720 sales directors tend to be money
03:49:09.000 oriented in general and so they're going
03:49:11.760 to keep making money so ads is probably
03:49:13.800 not the way to get them content unless
03:49:15.560 you have a salesperson audience probably
03:49:17.439 not going to be the way you can always
03:49:18.520 try it it's free give it a shot but I
03:49:20.439 wouldn't say I'm going to bet the farm
03:49:21.720 on this so it's probably not going to be
03:49:23.399 content and so usually you're going to
03:49:25.000 do one of these two which is you're
03:49:26.279 going to get a recruiter to do it or you
03:49:27.560 do it yourself but guess what a
03:49:28.600 recruiter
03:49:30.319 does they do Outreach too I know this is
03:49:32.880 going to sound crazy you message them
03:49:35.319 and you say hey I've got this role and
03:49:37.479 it looks like you're perfect for it
03:49:39.920 could I tell you about it or if you want
03:49:41.920 to be a little less direct you can say
03:49:44.199 you're an amazing person who' be a fit
03:49:45.920 for this role do you do you know anybody
03:49:47.640 else like you they're going to be like
03:49:49.080 screw everybody else talk to me Alex how
03:49:51.560 many people do I reach out to five five
03:49:55.840 no one's even going to read it if you
03:49:56.800 message five people 10 no one's going to
03:49:58.960 read it if you message 10
03:50:00.680 people reach out to 100 to 1,000 people
03:50:04.479 and if you get to that 1% on the 100 and
03:50:06.399 you haven't found it then you might have
03:50:07.399 to go 1% on a th000 and that's okay cuz
03:50:09.239 remember would you rather have a top 1%
03:50:11.040 sales director I sure this [ __ ] would so
03:50:12.920 it's okay to turn down the first you
03:50:14.880 talk to just cuz he has a pulse and has
03:50:17.520 one of these things it's like okay this
03:50:19.000 guy talked about metrics but he was a
03:50:21.960 dick and he actually doesn't have the
03:50:24.399 experience that I'm looking for well
03:50:26.080 then don't hire him the thing is is it's
03:50:28.920 tough to do that when you're an
03:50:29.640 entrepreneur because you're like I'm
03:50:31.120 bleeding every day the house is on fire
03:50:32.760 I need this roll but I promise you it's
03:50:34.760 way more painful to hire the person on
03:50:37.880 board them spend 2 months run getting
03:50:40.120 them up then they start hiring [ __ ]
03:50:42.199 because they're a [ __ ] and then all
03:50:43.760 of a sudden you're like oh my my God I
03:50:44.960 HTE this whole team and so even if you
03:50:46.840 do get rid of the top you then have all
03:50:48.840 the stuff they brought in underneath and
03:50:50.040 so you have to clean house and it's
03:50:51.600 really really painful and so as much as
03:50:53.600 you hire one to hire 10 if you fire one
03:50:57.000 sometimes you have to fire 10 and that
03:50:58.880 sucks and so getting this higher right
03:51:01.040 is super important but it's also why we
03:51:02.600 spend more time on it so now that we
03:51:04.040 hired our in-house sales director we
03:51:06.560 want to rebuild the compensation
03:51:08.080 structure right because remember the 20%
03:51:10.560 wasn't going to fly because if we just
03:51:12.239 flipped it to 20 we might as well just
03:51:13.680 save the effort right so we had to
03:51:15.359 rebuild the incentive structure the
03:51:17.080 problem that we had right now if you
03:51:18.279 remember was that we had the pro I think
03:51:20.120 it was problem one or problem two
03:51:21.080 whatever problem one problem two
03:51:22.120 whatever it was 20% of Revenue was going
03:51:25.439 to the Outsource sales team so we wanted
03:51:27.080 to make sure we were less than that our
03:51:28.399 Target was sub 10% and that's usually
03:51:31.120 around what I like to be in now I want
03:51:32.960 to be very clear here there are things
03:51:34.560 that this depends on so if you're in a
03:51:37.279 business where the salesman does self
03:51:38.960 gen meaning they generate their own lead
03:51:41.319 so if you're if you're going out Bend
03:51:42.840 and you're cold calling or you're door
03:51:44.239 knocking
03:51:45.040 then these percentages will be shifted
03:51:46.640 because you technically are a cost of
03:51:48.439 acquisition you're both marketing and
03:51:49.960 sales you're getting the leads and
03:51:51.359 closing the leads if you're handing
03:51:53.439 salese leads if you're running ads you
03:51:55.600 have a media team that then generates
03:51:57.120 leads or prospects for a sales team then
03:51:59.319 you basically have to split that cost
03:52:01.000 between the marketing team and the sales
03:52:03.399 guys and so given that let me explain
03:52:05.000 how I actually think about this what
03:52:06.800 skills do I need how rare are those
03:52:08.800 skills so if I'm feeding softballs to
03:52:12.760 somebody then I don't need need Ken
03:52:15.199 griffy to hit it out of the park all
03:52:17.239 right for jiny uh mookie bets all right
03:52:19.720 I don't need mookie bets to knock it out
03:52:21.159 of the park uh because I'm soft tossing
03:52:23.840 right anybody can probably rock it out
03:52:25.439 of the park that's double AER up because
03:52:27.920 at that level because it's so much
03:52:29.359 easier if you have crazy expectations
03:52:31.840 it's rarer and they have more skills so
03:52:33.640 you got to pay more if it's something
03:52:35.520 that's not a lot of skills and more
03:52:37.239 common you can pay less and so I just
03:52:38.960 think how much would I need to pay to
03:52:41.880 attract the level of salesperson I need
03:52:43.800 our goal is to take from 20% to around
03:52:45.600 10% or less and rebuild the complaint
03:52:47.960 you can think about
03:52:50.120 compensation in two columns all right
03:52:53.199 you've got money and not
03:52:56.120 money all right this very complicated
03:52:58.319 system I don't want to get into the
03:52:59.439 specific a lot of physics behind this
03:53:01.159 all right so you've got the money you
03:53:02.920 give them for closing deals and then
03:53:05.159 you've got other [ __ ] and so that's
03:53:09.199 recognition praise attention approval
03:53:14.120 perk
03:53:15.560 status if you publicly recognize them if
03:53:18.000 you have a leaderboard if you give them
03:53:19.680 more attention you get you actually
03:53:21.120 train them more you give them more
03:53:22.560 skills you say hey out a boy awesome job
03:53:25.800 great day today you say hey the guy who
03:53:27.760 closes the most gets to park in the nice
03:53:29.600 parking lot and then status like maybe
03:53:31.399 when they close a 100 sales they get a
03:53:32.760 hat with a stripe on it when they close
03:53:34.239 a th sales they get two stripes and so
03:53:36.680 forth so when you guys come on the team
03:53:37.920 they're like [ __ ] I want one of those
03:53:38.960 hats right sales team six let's go
03:53:41.479 there's all these things that you can do
03:53:43.080 to increase the value of of the job
03:53:45.359 outside of money and as much as people
03:53:47.720 sales guys include will be like that
03:53:49.000 doesn't motivate me sure as [ __ ] does
03:53:51.720 all right it totally does cuz it makes
03:53:53.439 your life better on the money side
03:53:55.319 there's a couple ways to do this all
03:53:56.880 right and so I'm going to explain how we
03:53:58.040 did it i' we've we've made a lot of
03:53:59.800 different compensation structures a lot
03:54:00.880 of it depends on again the business
03:54:02.680 that's involved now one of the big
03:54:04.319 decisions we made up front was that we
03:54:06.080 were going to comp
03:54:08.159 Setters and
03:54:10.640 closers now why is that so important the
03:54:13.279 funnel is through if I can increase my
03:54:15.600 show up rate by 20% it's just as good as
03:54:18.560 increasing my closure by 20% it makes no
03:54:20.600 difference the business they were just
03:54:22.279 as equally weighted in terms of their
03:54:24.040 value but again how rare are the skills
03:54:26.159 and what skills are required it's easier
03:54:27.640 to set than it is to close just as
03:54:29.159 important but easier Setters and closers
03:54:31.960 equally important but rarer to find a
03:54:34.520 skill from closers so they got paid a
03:54:35.720 little bit more but Setter still got
03:54:37.399 commissions as well to incentivize the
03:54:39.040 fact that they would get people to sh
03:54:41.120 cool so the way that I prefer to set up
03:54:43.720 compensation structures the idea that I
03:54:46.399 like to have is that I like ww at the
03:54:48.760 top which means winners win all right
03:54:50.520 which also means losers lose that's fine
03:54:53.080 there's more fewer winners than there
03:54:54.279 are losers what that means is you can
03:54:56.880 have ratchets for compensation meaning
03:55:00.800 if you close
03:55:04.479 50% of the people I'm just using
03:55:06.720 arbitrary number you get to keep your
03:55:09.359 job if you close
03:55:12.120 60% you get adab boys
03:55:15.199 if you close
03:55:17.520 70% your commission goes from 10% to 15%
03:55:22.279 ah 50% increase not bad if you close
03:55:25.319 above
03:55:26.159 80% you get
03:55:28.399 25% whoa right and so it ramps and so it
03:55:32.880 allows the people who are absolute
03:55:34.199 Killers to crush and then the people who
03:55:36.520 are not guess what happens down
03:55:40.600 here turn but this is structural turn
03:55:44.560 this is expected turn this is part of
03:55:46.439 the game with this type of role like if
03:55:48.640 you require work ethic you require
03:55:50.239 practice require people show up early
03:55:51.640 work late work weekends take calls it
03:55:54.159 requires a certain type of person and a
03:55:55.600 lot of people aren't cut out for it
03:55:56.600 which is also why most people don't make
03:55:58.199 multiple six figures a year selling we
03:56:00.040 fixed the compensation structure we
03:56:01.640 comped Setters and closers we ramped it
03:56:04.359 so that the best guys would get more
03:56:05.760 than 10% but we knew that as a team we
03:56:08.359 averaged around if you want to know the
03:56:09.720 actual number was we got the overall
03:56:12.239 everything Allin fully baked in
03:56:14.279 including the sales director for 9% we
03:56:17.880 are feeding them qualified prospects
03:56:20.680 they're not even prospects they're
03:56:22.000 customers we already have their [ __ ]
03:56:23.600 credit card like we just had to say want
03:56:25.840 more of the thing you just bought want
03:56:28.080 more help with that thing so you can get
03:56:29.920 the outcome you just said you wanted
03:56:31.800 like these are not hard sales and by
03:56:33.880 doing this we got to move on to step
03:56:36.439 three now that we rebuilt the incentive
03:56:37.880 and comp to get the types of sales guys
03:56:39.680 that we want on the team then we had to
03:56:41.800 rebuild the process so I'm going to walk
03:56:43.920 through what we do to improve each of
03:56:45.319 these numbers one by one because as
03:56:47.120 you're thinking about your business
03:56:48.239 there is no Silver Bullet there's no one
03:56:50.080 thing you're going to do that change
03:56:51.040 this entire process it's 100 golden BBS
03:56:52.880 and this is how we approach everything
03:56:54.439 in business and business is a pipeline
03:56:56.640 like this and so I'm going to show you
03:56:58.239 what we did and we did improve every one
03:56:59.760 of these numbers except for one but it
03:57:01.239 was okay and I'll show you why but
03:57:03.159 remember 100% of people are
03:57:05.080 automatically booked for this next
03:57:06.960 appointment all right and so we wanted
03:57:08.479 to improve this show up rate and so we
03:57:10.479 improved it to
03:57:12.600 91% woo ooh 74 9991 more money good
03:57:17.239 that's a 211% increase meaning if we did
03:57:19.520 nothing else we did nothing else in this
03:57:21.520 entire process everything willse stay
03:57:22.800 the same we would have a 20% increase in
03:57:24.840 sales and most of that would
03:57:26.120 disproportionately drop to the bottom
03:57:27.120 line cuz we already acquired the
03:57:28.000 customer so all this additional sales
03:57:29.760 money goes to profit big deal so we did
03:57:32.760 three things the first is that the
03:57:34.520 mercenary team is way too aggressive in
03:57:36.359 their copy false urgency false scarcity
03:57:38.680 people kind of see through it um so that
03:57:40.520 was number one that they did that we
03:57:41.560 fixed number two is they were giving
03:57:43.239 people way too much time time to book
03:57:44.840 out I'd say hey when do you want to show
03:57:46.920 up for your next call people would be
03:57:48.439 like oh how's 2 weeks from now and they
03:57:49.920 were like sure our big rule of thumb
03:57:51.840 despite the fact them trying to push out
03:57:53.920 five plus days for appointments is we
03:57:55.720 try to go for same day next day and
03:57:57.920 that's because in our history more
03:58:00.359 people show up the same to next day
03:58:01.600 appointments than 5 days plus from now
03:58:04.080 and so by just simply making the
03:58:06.080 messaging less aggressive shortening the
03:58:08.399 time when they can book their next call
03:58:09.920 and number three setting reminders that
03:58:12.600 were actually personalized so rather
03:58:14.439 than just Robo texts they're the green
03:58:16.399 ones that everyone [ __ ] hates right
03:58:18.640 we'd have the sales guy do a three-way
03:58:20.319 connection with the setter and say hey
03:58:22.359 my name's John it's nice to meet you
03:58:24.080 Sarah looks like you've got X Y andz
03:58:25.800 that I can reach from your account
03:58:27.000 really excited to talk to you tomorrow I
03:58:28.319 think I can help you with X Y and Z very
03:58:30.560 simple but it's a video or a voice memo
03:58:33.279 and they see it from a real person all
03:58:35.359 right and they can take a picture
03:58:36.399 whatever and those three things together
03:58:39.760 91% which is a 21% improvement so now
03:58:42.880 that we got people to show for that
03:58:44.520 first call how many of them did we get
03:58:47.000 to schedule the next call which is
03:58:48.479 basically the close of the set call
03:58:50.560 you're going to see some magic happen
03:58:52.199 right here we had a major Improvement
03:58:54.159 I'm not going to tell you what I'll tell
03:58:55.120 you how much we improved this one in a
03:58:56.600 second but we did two things to improve
03:58:58.840 the percentage of people who showed up
03:59:00.239 to set calls who decided to schedule
03:59:02.439 close calls all right so the number one
03:59:04.680 mistake that they were making in this
03:59:06.319 particular business is that again this
03:59:08.000 was an outsourc closing team and so they
03:59:10.000 were trying to minimize how much
03:59:12.319 unqualified work their closers would get
03:59:14.120 because they so carefully wanted to make
03:59:15.319 sure their closes were happy because
03:59:16.560 they were all mercenaries they all had
03:59:17.760 to pay them a ton just to show up to
03:59:19.279 work every day point being one the
03:59:21.520 incentives were misaligned and so
03:59:23.439 Setters remember we added our Setters
03:59:25.359 had a compensation to get people to set
03:59:27.080 they didn't have that we did add that
03:59:28.840 and so what do you know our Setters got
03:59:30.600 more people to schedule wild I know the
03:59:33.560 second thing was that they were deqing
03:59:35.680 people on the set call uh in my opinion
03:59:38.960 too early and so they wouldn't really go
03:59:40.840 through a sale they would just say hey
03:59:42.960 here's the price are you down to pay
03:59:44.640 that if yes I'll book you a call with
03:59:47.080 John but by doing that they were
03:59:49.120 basically not selling they were just
03:59:50.560 taking orders which if I just tell you
03:59:53.279 the price and you buy I don't need you
03:59:55.159 you're not selling at all you're just a
03:59:56.960 checkout page that's inefficient that
03:59:58.319 takes 20% we corrected number one we we
04:00:01.000 we align the incentives of the Setters
04:00:03.080 with the overall business not the closer
04:00:06.000 we align the setting incentive with the
04:00:08.080 business throughput which got rid of the
04:00:10.239 dqs that were overly deqing people and
04:00:14.000 we made sure that when they were talking
04:00:16.920 about the product we were just more
04:00:19.760 trying to qualify the prospect to make
04:00:22.399 sure they had the problem to solve and
04:00:24.399 the money to spend not telling them the
04:00:26.600 price of what they would ultimately buy
04:00:27.880 cuz we haven't sold them yet we just
04:00:29.040 want to make sure that this is a big
04:00:30.399 enough problem for them and that they
04:00:31.600 seem reasonably able to pay if we
04:00:34.560 present it to them our schedule
04:00:36.000 percentage went from survey says 53%
04:00:42.040 to 94% % for those keeping track at home
04:00:45.479 that's a 77% increase so forgetting this
04:00:49.359 one if we kept everything else the same
04:00:51.399 and we only did this we would have
04:00:53.239 increased sales by
04:00:55.239 77% assuming everything else stayed the
04:00:57.520 same but everything else didn't stay the
04:00:59.319 same so let me show you the next thing
04:01:00.800 we did which is we had people show up
04:01:02.760 for the first call we got 94% to
04:01:05.760 schedule the next call and now we have
04:01:07.680 what perc of these 94 actually showing
04:01:09.479 cuz hey maybe you just get everyone to
04:01:10.760 say yes so they get off the phone but
04:01:11.880 are they actually showing believe it or
04:01:13.560 not this is going to sound crazy the
04:01:15.399 show rate that we had here was actually
04:01:18.040 the same process that we had here
04:01:20.239 because believe it or not if people have
04:01:21.880 good experience and it's personalized to
04:01:23.439 them they're more likely to show and so
04:01:25.080 rather than explain literally repeat
04:01:26.560 myself I'm going to say how we actually
04:01:27.520 got the team to do it so we did four
04:01:29.120 things number one is we started
04:01:30.359 implementing daily training which means
04:01:31.960 that every day the team would get
04:01:33.159 together and they would roleplay the
04:01:34.439 scripting to make sure their tone was
04:01:35.920 right that they were coming off the
04:01:37.479 right way that they're hitting the main
04:01:38.680 points Mak sure that they were framing
04:01:40.159 things properly adding curiosity hitting
04:01:41.920 the main pain points that the prospect
04:01:43.159 was going to have so they could set up
04:01:44.239 the next call number two is that we do
04:01:45.880 gam tape reviews which is uh very simple
04:01:48.399 but you just watch gam tape with the
04:01:50.040 team and you have the person who is in
04:01:53.000 the call critique themselves so rather
04:01:55.319 than have everybody jump on them cuz no
04:01:56.880 one likes that it's horrible you just
04:01:58.960 have them say what are all the things
04:02:00.000 you could have done differently and then
04:02:02.120 the team says all the things they did
04:02:04.040 well cuz remember there's always
04:02:05.520 something someone did well you play the
04:02:07.000 tape they say all the things they would
04:02:08.960 have done differently and most people do
04:02:10.960 know when they watch it which is one of
04:02:12.319 the best ways to learn and then everyone
04:02:14.080 else says hey I think you did a great
04:02:15.080 job here I think you did a great job
04:02:16.239 here Bravo next one up the third thing
04:02:18.600 is this is why the sales director was so
04:02:20.199 key and why they were the first hir was
04:02:21.439 is doing one on ones and 101's you role
04:02:24.760 play like I you role play till you're
04:02:26.359 sick in the face you have to learn how
04:02:27.560 to train people how to speak like that's
04:02:29.520 what the job of the sales manager is
04:02:31.040 besides managing the culture of the team
04:02:32.640 is if John's Rapport building sucks
04:02:35.479 guess what sales manager does every time
04:02:37.520 they have a one with John they practice
04:02:39.319 Rapport building all right which means
04:02:41.000 you follow the script no say it again y
04:02:43.560 say it again try like this huh like
04:02:46.120 there you go change your tongue there it
04:02:47.319 is like we're talking 10 20 30 reps on
04:02:50.080 one or two phrases in the script so they
04:02:51.920 get it down if your salesman is not
04:02:54.239 talking back to you in the script on
04:02:56.600 your one-on ones you were literally
04:02:58.439 wasting time the fourth thing was just
04:03:00.479 end of day reports which is you just
04:03:02.399 want to make sure that they know you're
04:03:03.560 tracking what matters and if there's no
04:03:05.600 tracking throughout the week no one
04:03:06.880 feels held accountable it also doesn't
04:03:08.479 give you the opportunity to praise and
04:03:09.520 give out of voice all right and so every
04:03:11.279 day the stats are get tracked in real
04:03:13.080 time and daily leaders daily winners all
04:03:15.920 right so those are the four things we
04:03:17.040 did from here to drive our show rate
04:03:22.159 to woo 87% that's a 40% increase so if
04:03:26.760 we did nothing else but we just had this
04:03:29.600 one Improvement in this process and
04:03:31.199 everything else stayed the same we would
04:03:33.120 have increased sales by
04:03:34.680 40% not too shabby if you're following
04:03:37.760 at home which you should be we should at
04:03:40.159 this point have a ton more volume that
04:03:42.479 is coming to these closers massive
04:03:44.199 improvements cuz remember these are
04:03:45.239 customers this is why we felt like we
04:03:46.640 could do a lot better now hitting the
04:03:48.439 close call so in order to improve this
04:03:51.199 number to the best degree possible
04:03:52.120 because we never we're going to have
04:03:53.040 more disqualified people here remember
04:03:55.279 we we told the Setters send anybody you
04:03:57.239 can because we wanted to get more at
04:03:58.520 bats okay so one we also added in a vssl
04:04:01.800 so video sales letter between call one
04:04:03.159 and call two so people got to have some
04:04:05.120 social proof they got to see some
04:04:06.359 results they got to have a better
04:04:08.080 understanding because in my personal
04:04:09.120 opinion I don't like sales people
04:04:11.040 repeating a pitch I'd rather have
04:04:12.399 someone understand the benefits and then
04:04:13.960 have salesmen resolve concerns and
04:04:16.640 personalize solutions to customers
04:04:18.800 rather than have them say the same
04:04:20.600 15minute pitch CU it then it sounds
04:04:22.560 robotic and they zone out and so does
04:04:24.600 the prospect so I like to say here's all
04:04:26.080 the info watch that and then we'll talk
04:04:28.080 about it okay so number one is we added
04:04:30.279 that piece in number two we role played
04:04:33.800 a lot on the common objections and we
04:04:36.120 like to do that before the call the
04:04:37.920 video sales letter covered some of these
04:04:39.760 common concerns in the video so that the
04:04:42.319 sales guys had a little bit more of
04:04:43.760 Advantage going into the call and then
04:04:45.520 also in the scripting we front-loaded
04:04:47.680 the obstacles before you mention the
04:04:49.439 price you overcome obstacles after it's
04:04:52.080 objections all right so if I say hey do
04:04:55.159 you think your husband supports you in
04:04:56.560 doing this new thing before I say the
04:04:58.920 price then I've overcome an obstacle if
04:05:01.040 I say the price and I didn't overcome it
04:05:02.800 it becomes an objection which is way
04:05:04.120 harder to close we call it killing
04:05:05.720 zombies right you want to kill the
04:05:07.000 Zombies you want to defuse the bombs
04:05:09.359 before you talk about money and so we
04:05:11.439 front loaded the script to accom those
04:05:14.159 issues that people were losing in the
04:05:15.359 sales and we focused the script far more
04:05:17.680 on what they were going to experience
04:05:19.840 afterwards rather than the features
04:05:21.920 within the service because at the end of
04:05:24.439 the day they don't care about the
04:05:25.359 features of service they care about
04:05:26.439 where they're going to go what life's
04:05:27.479 going to be like afterwards so sell the
04:05:29.120 vacation not the plane flight so we made
04:05:30.920 those changes and
04:05:33.319 we got the close rate if you're like
04:05:35.640 wait 42 is lower than 80 sure as hell is
04:05:38.239 great math if we're doing the
04:05:39.600 percentages here and we have a 21%
04:05:41.680 increase here and a 77% increase here
04:05:44.399 and we have a 40% increase here so
04:05:46.279 that's 1.2 + 1.77 +
04:05:50.040 1.4 we have far more than a double in
04:05:53.520 terms of how much volume was going there
04:05:55.520 in fact we had three and 1 half times
04:05:57.040 more volume but we cut the Clos rate in
04:05:59.359 half but 3 1/2 * .5 is more than 1
04:06:05.080 meaning we increased the total
04:06:06.960 throughput of this system and so the end
04:06:09.279 result of this entire process
04:06:16.640 is we went from closing 20% of that 100
04:06:19.479 people that buy the product to 32 for a
04:06:22.640 net
04:06:23.479 Savings of going from 20% of Revenue to
04:06:26.520 9% so we paid less than half to get 60%
04:06:31.199 more sales and as you recall all
04:06:34.120 additional sales dropped to the bottom
04:06:36.159 line because we'd already acquired the
04:06:37.840 customers so now that we had ear in
04:06:39.680 house director we rebuilt the incentive
04:06:41.439 and comp plant and we rebuilt the sales
04:06:43.199 process now we wanted to scale so we had
04:06:45.760 to go from zero to 40 reps and we had to
04:06:49.359 do it in record time all right so number
04:06:51.359 one is that to go get all those people
04:06:53.640 we went everywhere all right so we
04:06:55.479 actually did all the things that
04:06:56.600 outlined but we also hired five to six
04:06:58.840 recruiters right off the bat we did a
04:07:01.640 ton of up on ourselves we hit our whole
04:07:04.199 email list up we did everything cuz we
04:07:06.000 had to hire 40 guys we had to do it in
04:07:07.399 12 weeks all right so number one is we
04:07:09.600 did everywhere so plus ads well actually
04:07:12.520 didn't do ads there's more uh
04:07:16.040 content and outbound all right so
04:07:18.199 recruiters content and outbound is what
04:07:19.840 we did to get all the people in the door
04:07:21.960 now once we had people in the door we
04:07:24.080 didn't have the sales director interview
04:07:25.720 all these candidates because he just
04:07:26.920 wouldn't literally have the time he did
04:07:28.439 a final check off once the team planned
04:07:31.080 on hiring them and so we had the manager
04:07:33.600 for the Setters do do several of the
04:07:35.840 talks with the leads and we also had the
04:07:38.760 recruiters do a lot of the screening as
04:07:40.239 well so that the sales director could
04:07:41.840 save his time and still keep managing
04:07:43.880 the actual team and training the people
04:07:45.080 who are on the floor making money for
04:07:47.119 the company all right so
04:07:49.960 saved
04:07:52.159 directors time the next thing is okay
04:07:55.080 great so we got a lot of people we got
04:07:56.600 them hired but how do we make sure that
04:07:57.880 they're actually good so we automated
04:07:59.960 the sales
04:08:02.279 training to the greatest degree possible
04:08:04.800 now what does that really mean it means
04:08:06.399 we made a course that was an internal
04:08:08.159 course on how to sell this thing and so
04:08:10.920 the nice thing with internal courses if
04:08:12.279 you don't have them high recommend it
04:08:14.479 because the most expensive thing a
04:08:15.640 business can do is train salespeople
04:08:17.760 reason why is because when you take a
04:08:20.319 salesperson and you train them on live
04:08:22.680 prospects all of the money they don't
04:08:24.800 close is money you lose and you lose all
04:08:27.920 like you lose the money that you could
04:08:29.239 have made and you lose the money that
04:08:31.080 you spent to get them there very
04:08:32.960 expensive all right especially when and
04:08:35.080 this happens a lot too you do all of
04:08:37.000 that only to have them get fired or
04:08:39.880 leave or burn out or whatever all right
04:08:42.199 and so we want them to take as many reps
04:08:43.880 ass soonly possible in a fashion where
04:08:46.359 there's no risk to the company which is
04:08:48.399 why we have them watch tons of gam tape
04:08:50.479 footage they tend all the meetings they
04:08:52.199 listen to tons of live calls they go
04:08:54.399 through the course and then they
04:08:55.840 roleplay there's one takeaway from this
04:08:57.720 [ __ ] video it's that you roleplay
04:08:58.880 with your team and that you get really
04:09:00.479 really narrow on the things you want
04:09:01.640 them to improve and you keep nailing
04:09:03.359 that thing until it's perfect and then
04:09:04.760 you move to the next thing there's no
04:09:06.399 point in trying to tell someone to
04:09:07.279 improve six things doesn't work I
04:09:09.399 promise you it doesn't work I spent too
04:09:10.920 long doing this doesn't work you say
04:09:13.640 let's work on the first sentence of the
04:09:14.880 [ __ ] script keep doing it again try
04:09:17.040 it again try it again try it again one
04:09:18.720 more time say it lighter say it faster
04:09:20.479 Loop to this one got it second question
04:09:23.920 right that's how you work through a
04:09:25.000 script until they will they will be able
04:09:26.359 to breathe it in their sleep then they
04:09:28.640 can actually be present for the sales
04:09:29.800 call cuz they don't have to think about
04:09:30.720 the scripting cuz they already know it
04:09:32.279 so we recruited the people we saved the
04:09:34.159 director's time we automated the
04:09:35.520 internal onboarding I'm going to give
04:09:37.479 you a pro tip from
04:09:39.319 me which is that if someone seems like a
04:09:41.399 dad within 14 days let them go
04:09:43.960 some people think I'm heartless how
04:09:45.760 could I be so heartless because I have
04:09:48.000 other families I have to look out for
04:09:49.520 too and if we don't keep the sales team
04:09:51.840 profitable the whole business doesn't
04:09:53.279 work we give people a shot we get to all
04:09:55.479 this stuff we give them a ton of free
04:09:56.560 training all right they actually
04:09:57.600 technically get paid to get trained and
04:09:59.000 if they don't if they're not up to chops
04:10:00.720 we got to let them go but we set that
04:10:02.520 expectation up front and one more thing
04:10:04.600 and this is a a little Pro tip for me I
04:10:07.720 don't know how to spell that but no
04:10:09.760 padas all right so no special snowflakes
04:10:12.960 because the thing is is even if you have
04:10:14.319 one killer on the team and they don't
04:10:16.000 follow the process they undermine the
04:10:18.359 entirety of the process and they also
04:10:20.040 kill the culture and so if one guy does
04:10:22.960 double the sales of everybody else or
04:10:24.680 triple the sales of everyone else I can
04:10:26.560 almost guarantee nine times out of 10 in
04:10:28.720 my experience they actually take those
04:10:30.800 sales out of the organization overall so
04:10:33.960 one guy does triple and everyone's like
04:10:35.439 oh we should be like him but the you if
04:10:37.040 you have like a 20 person team and
04:10:38.159 everyone goes down by 10% because of
04:10:39.439 this guy because the cancer spreads not
04:10:41.960 worth it just cut it out keep the system
04:10:44.239 and now that we had the in-house
04:10:45.359 director we rebuilt the incentive and
04:10:46.800 comp plan we rebuilt the sales process
04:10:48.560 we scaled the sales team and we
04:10:49.920 stabilized it so that we were
04:10:51.199 consistently beating the other team and
04:10:53.800 doing it for less then we're able to
04:10:55.680 move on to step five which is get rid of
04:11:00.560 outsourced
04:11:02.359 team so with the ouse team we did $7
04:11:06.600 million in cash collected in q1 the
04:11:10.279 commission on that was 1. $4 million
04:11:14.359 remember 20% so the company got to
04:11:17.880 profit 5.6 I'm saying profit Loosely 5.6
04:11:21.319 the company got to keep after paying the
04:11:23.000 sale the out Outsource sales team this
04:11:27.359 7% with the in-house sales team
04:11:31.479 became $12 million the next quarter the
04:11:35.960 commission because instead of
04:11:38.600 20% we went to 9% so the commission went
04:11:42.080 from 1.4 million on 7 to
04:11:45.600 1.08 million for 12 net change here was
04:11:50.880 12 minus 1
04:11:54.119 10.92 million which created the
04:11:57.600 difference between these two was
04:12:04.479 5.4
04:12:06.439 million and that was just in that
04:12:09.520 quarter times four for the year and you
04:12:13.040 get 21.6 million this is one of my
04:12:15.560 favorite sales presentations I've ever
04:12:17.159 given and it covers three things one how
04:12:19.800 to ask the right questions two how to
04:12:22.119 ask them the right way and three how to
04:12:24.000 duplicate those words in that tone
04:12:26.319 across a team of people if you're
04:12:27.760 building your first sales script if
04:12:29.720 you're scaling a sales team and you want
04:12:31.760 to make sure that you can onboard new
04:12:33.080 people and get them selling at the same
04:12:34.399 percentage or better than you are right
04:12:36.080 now which for many people is biggest
04:12:37.880 bottleneck especially when you're coming
04:12:39.279 to for your first million or first 3
04:12:40.640 million per year scaling the sales team
04:12:42.439 is one of the most difficult tasks and
04:12:43.840 so I've broken this down into three
04:12:45.159 Frameworks that I've used very
04:12:46.560 successfully to scale lots of different
04:12:47.840 sales teams I say that the the company
04:12:50.000 I'm referencing in this video has 14
04:12:51.880 that one company already now has almost
04:12:53.680 30 sales guys so this process continued
04:12:55.960 to work past when I made this
04:12:57.840 presentation so if you're trying to
04:12:59.159 scale sales you want to close a higher
04:13:00.880 percentage you want to get more guys
04:13:02.319 closing at that same percentage or
04:13:04.080 better than yours and if you don't know
04:13:05.399 who I am my name is alosi I acquisition.
04:13:07.199 comom with a portfolio at this moment of
04:13:08.800 six companies to do $85 million a year
04:13:10.439 keep being awesome love you and enjoy
04:13:11.680 the video
04:13:13.520 what I'm going to be breaking down today
04:13:14.960 is the scripting process that we've
04:13:16.439 applied for calls right and so as the
04:13:19.960 world's worst marketer I set my first
04:13:21.359 email this year I was very excited about
04:13:22.760 it we've been in business for 10 years
04:13:24.840 uh pretty big stuff and it was because I
04:13:26.640 couldn't get webinars I couldn't get
04:13:27.840 vsls I couldn't get all the fancy stuff
04:13:31.159 that you guys get to work um and so I
04:13:33.239 went back in time and just was like if I
04:13:34.680 can just get him to give my phone number
04:13:36.239 I'll be able to get him to you like buy
04:13:37.680 [ __ ] from me and so I went and called
04:13:39.680 back all these webinar leads that never
04:13:40.920 showed up or never bought or whatever
04:13:42.680 and then doing like 100,000 in sales in
04:13:44.560 a day and I was like wow this is so much
04:13:47.760 easier and so over time I've consulted
04:13:51.119 with sales teams I've uh trained and
04:13:53.600 owned four high ticket uh performance
04:13:56.159 teams uh I think we have 12 or 14 sales
04:13:59.439 guys now it kind of rotates and so what
04:14:00.720 I want to do is kind of show you what
04:14:01.880 we've done to consistently replicate the
04:14:03.960 skill of sales another human being would
04:14:05.840 that be cool all right so if I can add
04:14:07.840 like 10% to your conversion rate in
04:14:09.640 terms of how you attract better closers
04:14:11.840 how you script the process out and how
04:14:13.520 you should close more deals and scale
04:14:14.920 them to incentivize them would that be
04:14:16.199 valuable for you guys all right sweet so
04:14:18.960 these are the three Frameworks that
04:14:20.760 transform losing funnels in cash
04:14:22.119 machines that was my real life that was
04:14:23.479 a picture of my actual first funnel and
04:14:25.960 that's what it became and so these are
04:14:27.560 the three fail uh the Frameworks number
04:14:29.399 one closure framework how to ask
04:14:31.159 questions that prospects to say yes
04:14:33.199 adding this to a funnel instantly can
04:14:34.560 make it profitable right this is my
04:14:35.920 personal experience number two is
04:14:37.960 conviction framework all right how
04:14:39.439 anyone who believes can outperform a
04:14:41.319 seasoned sales rep by simply learning
04:14:42.760 control control their tone really
04:14:45.000 important this is one of the biggest
04:14:45.960 things that most sales people Miss
04:14:48.279 number three the scaling framework how
04:14:49.640 to easily duplicate this process across
04:14:51.520 sales people in any niche in seven days
04:14:52.920 or less so seven days from now we can do
04:14:55.640 this would that be cool all right let's
04:14:57.680 rock so number one the closure framework
04:15:00.960 after going through hundreds of scripts
04:15:02.640 I've bought Grant stuff I bought the
04:15:03.760 Wolf of Wall Street stuff I bought all
04:15:05.040 that stuff and going through my own
04:15:06.720 sales processes I learned that the the
04:15:08.359 scripting process even was simpler I
04:15:10.399 think than it's portrayed and it's not
04:15:12.520 that it's something to be sold against
04:15:14.319 but um every sales script that has been
04:15:17.159 absolute Gang Busters has been a
04:15:18.640 question-based framework that is based
04:15:20.479 on this process all right and this works
04:15:22.560 for B Toc sales it works for B Tob uh
04:15:24.600 B2B sales it works for $500 tickets it
04:15:27.040 works for $100,000 tickets the process
04:15:29.119 is the same and so this is the acronym
04:15:31.359 closure framework as I said world's
04:15:33.119 dumbest marketer so I made it nice and
04:15:34.479 easy to remember all right so C clarify
04:15:37.600 why they are there when I look at
04:15:39.080 creating a script the first thing we ask
04:15:41.080 is like why the hell are you here what
04:15:42.680 mean you reach out to us today what was
04:15:44.560 the thing what is the goal you're trying
04:15:45.720 to accomplish right two label them with
04:15:48.279 a problem we can't cure cancer unless
04:15:50.600 they admit that they have it right has
04:15:52.119 anyone had a situation where like I just
04:15:53.600 want to find out more information you
04:15:54.960 ever had that right well it's like well
04:15:57.439 I'm assuming you're not hopping on sales
04:15:58.640 calls all day just trying to find
04:15:59.800 information is there a problem you're
04:16:00.720 trying to solve oh you're fat got it all
04:16:03.840 right boom so that's a problem we can
04:16:05.520 solve it after that I'm I'm assuming I'm
04:16:07.920 not the first guy you've ever dated
04:16:09.479 right so is there anything else that
04:16:10.680 you've had happen in the past that got
04:16:12.000 you here that didn't work I'd love to
04:16:13.680 know more about it s once we've gone
04:16:15.840 through the pain we sell on the vacation
04:16:17.479 right there's a process that I'll walk
04:16:18.680 through e we explain away their concerns
04:16:20.720 cuz obviously samean people don't make
04:16:22.119 decisions on the first call unless
04:16:24.319 you're a closer in which case they do
04:16:26.439 which I'll talk about and then finally
04:16:28.080 and this is something that we actually
04:16:29.159 added in my original flamework for my
04:16:30.600 first couple years was close and then we
04:16:32.920 added the r uh because when you do this
04:16:35.560 it actually transitions into the
04:16:37.080 onboarding process that will get higher
04:16:39.399 LTV per customer lower churn lower
04:16:41.720 refunds lower charge backs which sales
04:16:43.359 guys and you will be happy about cool
04:16:46.239 all right let's rock so we'll examine
04:16:48.199 each one more closely clarify why
04:16:50.080 they're there these are the questions
04:16:51.159 that sounds like what made you come in
04:16:52.560 today what made you reach out what's
04:16:53.720 your goal right now why is that
04:16:54.760 important to you why that number
04:16:56.080 specifically what does it what does it
04:16:57.720 resonate for you right why why is that
04:16:59.680 real L the questions that we're looking
04:17:02.359 is like okay so what I'm hearing is XYZ
04:17:04.640 us your goal does that sound about right
04:17:06.600 right really simple but very important
04:17:08.119 it's a milestone that has to be hit in
04:17:10.159 the process all right then we overview
04:17:12.560 all right this is where we're Gathering
04:17:13.640 all the inel and for some of you guys my
04:17:15.479 goal is that you can take this to your
04:17:16.680 sales team your sales director and run
04:17:18.399 your script through this framework and
04:17:20.600 then see where you can plug in you
04:17:22.040 probably have some of it but if you're
04:17:23.359 missing one or two of these questions
04:17:25.319 and Milestones you're losing conversions
04:17:26.840 on the call like you're closing people
04:17:28.960 who already had those obstacles covered
04:17:31.720 but everyone who didn't have two of
04:17:33.040 these questions covered you lose them
04:17:34.920 and you don't know why you watch the
04:17:36.319 sales call you're like what the hell
04:17:37.359 happened here right so what have you
04:17:40.040 tried so far to accomplish that how this
04:17:41.960 is what we call the pain cycle it's a
04:17:43.239 four-step process what have you tried so
04:17:45.199 far to accomplish this how long did you
04:17:46.800 do that for how long ago how did that
04:17:49.279 work for you what else have you tried
04:17:51.199 right so we just do that cycle until
04:17:52.560 they're like well yeah that's it now
04:17:54.600 that you think about it I've tried
04:17:55.520 everything under the sun like I can't
04:17:57.399 imagine what that's felt like wow right
04:18:00.960 it's not your fault you're so close
04:18:03.479 you're 6 Ines away right and I think you
04:18:06.159 you said this one thing which I'm about
04:18:07.239 to show you in a second we could be able
04:18:08.960 to help you want to hear about the
04:18:09.800 program fantastic that's when we
04:18:11.640 transition to the sale right right so
04:18:13.239 sell them a vacation the number one
04:18:14.840 thing that people mess up our sales
04:18:16.760 pitch on the call is under 3
04:18:18.960 minutes 3 minutes 180 seconds when we
04:18:23.119 talk about um I think someone was asking
04:18:24.960 about what are the bullets on the page
04:18:28.000 we don't say anything about that because
04:18:30.319 what we're trying to do is get them to
04:18:31.880 understand what they're going to
04:18:32.920 experience not how they're going to
04:18:34.359 experience it right and so when we have
04:18:37.080 a sales pitch just about every time we
04:18:39.159 sell three things right and it doesn't
04:18:41.040 matter what industry you're in I was
04:18:42.279 training mortgage leads team and they
04:18:44.159 were selling leads right and it was like
04:18:46.119 uh the leads are exclusive they're
04:18:47.880 timely and they're qualified right and
04:18:50.199 so we talked about hey you've had leads
04:18:51.720 in the past ah well the Zillow leads my
04:18:54.319 real estate people right the Zillow
04:18:56.080 leads are not they are timely but
04:18:58.159 they're definitely not exclusive and
04:18:59.319 these are people just window shopping
04:19:00.720 right our leads are different three
04:19:02.359 things you can always find them your s
04:19:04.159 fitness your own Fitness Nutrition
04:19:05.960 accountability right and so what we do
04:19:07.960 is when we say the three bullets get
04:19:10.159 them to understand yes that takes 5
04:19:11.960 Seconds cool fitness-wise we get the
04:19:14.479 commitment this is what I need you to do
04:19:16.040 fair enough be like I need you to work
04:19:17.399 out three days a week can you do that
04:19:18.840 awesome if we see any hesitation you
04:19:21.359 have a 30second story that's memorized
04:19:24.319 most of this script and this is what
04:19:25.560 makes it scalable is a question-based
04:19:27.040 framework which means if you get lost
04:19:29.439 you can find your way back again if
04:19:31.239 anybody here have scripts that are like
04:19:32.520 paragraphs and stuff
04:19:34.239 anyone okay like no no one has a script
04:19:36.840 that's paragraphs and Pages please we
04:19:39.640 all
04:19:40.680 know um but if you have those things
04:19:44.119 it'll totally mess it up because then
04:19:45.319 the the sales guy gets lost and then
04:19:46.720 he's just freeballing and he has no idea
04:19:48.960 where he is hot doging a hallway no idea
04:19:50.479 what's going on right and so the point
04:19:52.760 is here little visual anyways is that
04:19:56.080 when we're telling the story like with
04:19:57.199 the fitness example I would say hey when
04:19:58.760 you failed in the past like right now do
04:20:01.000 you have a do you have a favorite TV
04:20:02.159 show Game of Thrones that's awesome do
04:20:05.040 you feel like like you got to get
04:20:07.000 motivated to watch Game of Thrones
04:20:08.279 you're like oh man I've been wanting to
04:20:09.600 watch it but I just can't get up the
04:20:11.279 motivation to watch TV they're like well
04:20:13.600 no I don't have that it's like right and
04:20:15.880 so that's exactly how we're going to
04:20:17.239 make your fitness program so if you look
04:20:18.680 forward to you don't need the motivation
04:20:20.520 The Willpower because that's why you
04:20:22.040 fail in the past they're like oh I
04:20:25.279 didn't talk about the workouts the heart
04:20:28.239 rate and the calories they're going to
04:20:29.600 burn and they're going to sweat cuz all
04:20:30.720 that [ __ ] sounds like work right but
04:20:33.399 what they do get is exactly what they
04:20:34.960 want which is wait so you're telling me
04:20:36.800 that if I actually like something I'm
04:20:39.279 not going to even have to try and it's
04:20:40.800 going to feel like watching TV cuz I
04:20:42.040 look forward to it it's exactly what I'm
04:20:43.520 saying and if you can deliver you make
04:20:45.279 tons of money and that's the point so
04:20:47.279 each of those points your sales guy
04:20:49.439 should know what that anecdotal story is
04:20:53.479 right if I was selling accountability
04:20:55.399 anyone have kids anyone here tell their
04:20:57.800 kids to brush their teeth and we have
04:21:00.000 their kids to brush their teeth say they
04:21:01.279 don't want to brush their teeth anyone
04:21:03.479 tell their kids even though they want to
04:21:04.600 brush their teeth to brush their teeth
04:21:06.359 anyways and now you're an adult did your
04:21:08.239 parents did that to you do you brush
04:21:10.399 your teeth that's an example of external
04:21:13.560 accountability turning into an internal
04:21:15.080 habit it's exactly what the
04:21:16.199 accountability we're going to do in this
04:21:17.040 program indust does that make sense
04:21:18.840 great done next bullet that's how you
04:21:21.520 transition in the pitch right so if you
04:21:23.399 think about this process why are you
04:21:25.319 here I have cancer I think we might be
04:21:27.000 able to help you out but I don't want to
04:21:27.960 get into that because I don't know about
04:21:28.880 you like I don't know what your
04:21:30.000 situation is tell me what you've done ah
04:21:32.800 that sounds that sounds great that makes
04:21:34.479 sense okay I think we might be able to
04:21:37.199 help see a little bit about that all I
04:21:39.199 did is I tell three stories that make
04:21:40.800 complete sense to everything you just
04:21:42.199 told me
04:21:43.239 and then we transition and so um I
04:21:45.479 pretty much just covered this um but we
04:21:48.439 we call it sell on the vacation not the
04:21:49.600 plane flight right and so we're not
04:21:51.199 selling TSA we're not selling your
04:21:52.720 modules your me plant your macr workout
04:21:54.080 your sport team your URLs your whatever
04:21:56.960 right we're selling Maui we're selling
04:21:58.680 the Final Destination and it doesn't
04:22:00.319 matter what level of service you are
04:22:01.520 selling you're always selling the same
04:22:02.960 thing it's always Maui it's just how do
04:22:05.279 you want to get there you want to swim
04:22:06.560 to Maui right do you want to take a boat
04:22:08.960 to Maui do you want to take a normal
04:22:10.399 flight or do you want to take a private
04:22:11.920 jet to Maui
04:22:13.040 right it's your call you're getting to
04:22:13.960 Mau either way because we're a man of
04:22:15.080 our word and I'm not going to sell you
04:22:16.640 something that's not going to deliver
04:22:17.880 right but it's going to be a little
04:22:18.800 different it's a little bit rock here
04:22:19.640 but we're going to get you there all
04:22:20.680 right so everyone gets the Maui the
04:22:22.359 variables are the the speed and the
04:22:23.800 quality of the journey all right the
04:22:25.000 likelihood of arrival is assumed so
04:22:27.640 since it's always the same thing you
04:22:29.880 probably have multiple levels of
04:22:30.920 business um but it's always the same
04:22:33.000 process right and so once we have that
04:22:35.040 they're like got it then we just make
04:22:37.399 the ask all right from this point going
04:22:39.000 forward it's explaining way their
04:22:40.600 concerns like any human being would
04:22:42.520 normally do I could drill price over
04:22:44.159 comes with you but I think it's more
04:22:45.520 valuable to explain the thought process
04:22:47.359 behind price stall and decision maker um
04:22:52.040 objections all right so the first and
04:22:53.319 obvious one is I can't afford it anyone
04:22:55.199 to get this one right couple people two
04:22:58.199 people of God in the you guys have the
04:23:00.199 best leads give me your leads um and so
04:23:04.159 the easy question that I use to explain
04:23:05.680 to our sales team because it's really
04:23:06.840 about breaking their Le beliefs is if we
04:23:09.399 were giving away Ferraris right now for
04:23:11.520 five grand do you think they'd find a
04:23:13.720 way to get the
04:23:14.960 money yes so that simply they do not
04:23:18.640 understand the value we're trying to
04:23:19.560 provide and if you can get your team to
04:23:21.359 believe that then they understand that
04:23:22.760 it is always their fault if someone
04:23:24.960 cannot afford the program does that make
04:23:27.199 sense fantastic second decisionmaker
04:23:30.720 clothes one of the hardest things to
04:23:33.040 overcome right I got to have my business
04:23:35.159 partner I got to have my husband my
04:23:36.880 spouse my whatever right so we have a
04:23:39.680 specific process that we go about this
04:23:42.080 and so what we do is in the very
04:23:43.319 beginning we just say we circumvent then
04:23:46.399 we go over past agreements and then we
04:23:48.040 ask for forgiveness all right this is
04:23:49.640 the best way that I've seen to overcome
04:23:51.040 this so the first thing we say is well
04:23:53.239 what if they say no one out of three
04:23:55.159 times they'll be like I'd probably do it
04:23:56.359 anyways and we're like let's get started
04:23:58.080 boom it's done you'd be amazed how many
04:23:59.920 times that actually works it's hilarious
04:24:02.040 if they say well then I wouldn't do it
04:24:03.680 then we divert we say well what do you
04:24:06.880 think their biggest objection would be
04:24:08.279 about it because now they're just using
04:24:09.560 a foil even the person's not there and
04:24:10.880 has no idea what the program is cuz
04:24:11.800 they're not involved with call right
04:24:13.119 they're like well I think this and at
04:24:14.800 this point we can attack the actual
04:24:16.040 obstacle even though the decision maker
04:24:17.520 isn't there now if they still if we
04:24:19.319 still can't overcome it then we go to P
04:24:21.119 agreements we say well does your
04:24:23.199 business partner know you guys are
04:24:24.319 struggling on sales well yeah does he
04:24:26.880 approve of that well no then why would
04:24:29.640 he be against something that he already
04:24:30.960 doesn't approve of that doesn't make any
04:24:32.800 sense why would he be against a business
04:24:33.720 partner solving a problem is know what
04:24:34.760 you do well that's great you're being a
04:24:36.640 great partner let's go right and so we
04:24:38.680 try and rely on past agreements that are
04:24:41.000 obvious and use those to Pro into the
04:24:42.840 present right and then finally you know
04:24:45.880 sometimes it's better ask for uh
04:24:47.760 forgiveness and permission right and so
04:24:50.359 we'll tack that on to the end you can
04:24:51.439 put that at the end of any of the closes
04:24:53.560 and so when we're dealing with this with
04:24:55.600 price it's value with decision maker we
04:24:58.920 go on past agreements and with stalls we
04:25:02.119 just teach people to make decisions
04:25:04.520 people are just so afraid of making the
04:25:06.239 wrong decision they're petrified and so
04:25:08.600 what we do is we literally teach them on
04:25:09.880 the call here's how we make a decision
04:25:11.960 these are the the variables you should
04:25:13.080 be considering X Y and Z right can the
04:25:15.920 product meet your needs do you think
04:25:17.800 that if you work with us you have a
04:25:19.239 greater or lower likelihood of losing
04:25:21.479 weight greater fantastic I think we're
04:25:24.080 halfway there do you want to work with
04:25:25.840 us do you think it'd be fun to hang out
04:25:26.960 and see me every day because believe me
04:25:28.399 this stash I had to I had to work 12
04:25:30.479 months to get my wife to say yes to that
04:25:31.960 so I understand if you're hesitant does
04:25:33.560 that make sense would you be willing to
04:25:35.000 do that all right let's rock right and
04:25:37.239 then do you have access to funds or know
04:25:39.040 someone who does right because it's not
04:25:40.560 just about you because if it's something
04:25:41.479 that's amazing we can find other ways to
04:25:43.680 finance this so do you have access or
04:25:46.199 know someone who does yes well then
04:25:48.880 great let's get started and if for some
04:25:51.479 reason we haven't closed them at this
04:25:53.000 point we say how about this let's take a
04:25:55.520 card down we'll delay the payment to
04:25:57.239 Friday you go to your husband you go to
04:25:59.000 your business partner right you go to
04:26:00.319 your I love this one you go to your
04:26:01.560 husband right and he says baby I want
04:26:04.560 you to live a shorter life I want you to
04:26:06.800 I want you to be a terrible example to
04:26:08.359 our kids I want you to not have
04:26:10.359 generational Health in our family to be
04:26:12.520 down I want you to sit in that corner I
04:26:14.119 want you to pull those sweatpants up
04:26:15.640 take up a bag of Cheetos rub your
04:26:17.640 fingers on there right and just get
04:26:19.080 comfortable with the fact that you're
04:26:20.319 never going to look better than you are
04:26:21.319 right now I like if your husband says
04:26:22.600 that to you you call me back and I will
04:26:24.680 tear this contract up fair enough right
04:26:27.640 you close them all right so we explain
04:26:29.359 where their concerns and then finally we
04:26:31.279 get the yes we reinforce the decision
04:26:33.600 this is stuff that we started doing and
04:26:35.040 it helped a lot so personalized video
04:26:37.279 from the CEO hey welcome aboard so happy
04:26:39.359 to have you thank you for trusting us
04:26:40.359 with your business hey we're so happy to
04:26:42.040 have you you thank you for trust me with
04:26:42.920 your your weight loss Journey know
04:26:43.920 personalized this is we want to do
04:26:45.199 everything in our power to absolutely
04:26:46.119 Amaze you right little things like that
04:26:48.520 because the customer is usually deciding
04:26:49.840 whether or not they like your business
04:26:51.560 in the first 48 hours after the sale I
04:26:53.680 learned this later so how you hand off
04:26:56.040 from sale to customer experience and
04:26:58.439 activation is where this all happens
04:27:00.880 does that make sense is that cool was
04:27:02.960 that nice love framework to work through
04:27:04.800 okay so that's the disclosure framework
04:27:07.439 that is the first thing that's what you
04:27:08.479 can run your script through all right
04:27:09.800 how to ask the questions to get the
04:27:11.199 prospects to say yes
04:27:13.000 check one down two to go you with me you
04:27:15.640 still good all right let's rock so
04:27:18.239 conviction framework number two how
04:27:19.680 anyone who believes can outperform a
04:27:22.000 season sales rep by simply learning to
04:27:24.199 control their tone all right so um after
04:27:27.760 I reworked all of our scripts using the
04:27:29.520 closure framework um some of my guys
04:27:32.319 were really successful but other ones
04:27:34.479 still blew and I was like well this
04:27:36.319 sucks right I was really excited I had a
04:27:38.560 little acronym and everything I was like
04:27:40.680 that took me a long time to come with
04:27:41.760 the acronym right and I was like what
04:27:44.119 gives and so I talked to some my friends
04:27:47.880 um and they recommended this book which
04:27:49.840 was awesome and the biggest takeaway
04:27:51.520 from this book is the is the concept of
04:27:53.239 tone and this was something that really
04:27:55.159 helped take us and give an extra Edge
04:27:57.399 for our sales training ourselves process
04:27:59.439 and the coaching that we give people
04:28:01.479 right and so in the book he talked about
04:28:03.560 the hidden dialogue um which I just love
04:28:05.680 and I just I just never want to take
04:28:06.720 credit for an idea because I got it from
04:28:07.880 him um but there's two dialogues that
04:28:09.560 are happening right um because the words
04:28:12.399 or the logic right what you're actually
04:28:14.600 saying is talking to The Logical brain
04:28:16.800 how you say it is talking to the
04:28:18.680 emotional brain right that's the one's
04:28:20.399 making decision that's the one running
04:28:21.439 the shop all right and so how you say
04:28:24.000 what you
04:28:25.119 say is what you
04:28:28.080 say so here's an example that's my wife
04:28:31.399 she's going to be here with me soon but
04:28:34.040 if she were here if she
04:28:36.239 said Alex right or Alex right or Alex
04:28:42.960 very different meanings very different
04:28:45.040 afternoon for me in each of these
04:28:47.080 scenarios
04:28:48.640 right based on how she said it because
04:28:51.000 there's so much communicated and that's
04:28:52.479 just one word imagine a 30 minute
04:28:55.600 dialogue where each word can be chosen
04:28:58.720 to have packed with the meaning that you
04:29:01.080 need them to feel does that make sense
04:29:04.319 okay so we need the words for The
04:29:06.399 Logical influence we need the tone for
04:29:07.840 the emotional influence we need both
04:29:09.800 okay and so once you become a more
04:29:11.600 seasoned like sales crap you can learn
04:29:13.239 to control your tone on purpose right
04:29:14.960 you can raise your voice at the end of
04:29:16.000 the statement to make it into a
04:29:17.680 question right it's a
04:29:20.760 question this is
04:29:22.640 John right I didn't need to ask him I'm
04:29:25.359 saying you know to answer that as a
04:29:27.279 question I didn't ask you that but you
04:29:28.319 know that based on the tone right or I
04:29:31.279 could lower my voice right now so you
04:29:32.319 know that what I'm saying extremely
04:29:34.920 important right tone matters and so it
04:29:38.560 takes time to develop this level of
04:29:40.159 unconscious Mastery so there's two ways
04:29:42.319 to develop this and I believe that you
04:29:44.560 can either trick yourself into it or you
04:29:46.560 can train yourself into it and since I
04:29:49.239 don't have enough time in 30 minutes to
04:29:50.680 train on the influence of tonalities
04:29:52.800 here's the trick is that all right I'll
04:29:54.040 just give you the hack conviction will
04:29:56.199 correct your
04:29:57.399 tone if you believe in what you sell you
04:30:00.960 will say it the right way and that's why
04:30:03.359 some of you guys have a sales rep it
04:30:04.640 comes on crushes it and then tanks
04:30:07.080 because they did believe and then they
04:30:08.720 saw your reviews or they got customer
04:30:11.159 support feedback someone called them up
04:30:12.680 after buying it was like [ __ ] you I
04:30:14.439 can't believe you did that and they're
04:30:16.439 done and then all their tones off
04:30:18.479 because they feel like out of Ethics
04:30:20.119 right and so I'm lowering my tone right
04:30:21.880 now so you know that this is really
04:30:23.000 important right and so I'll go upbeat
04:30:26.319 kiss the boooo bring us back up all
04:30:28.159 right and so real estate sales team
04:30:30.159 Consulting this is a great story so I
04:30:32.159 was flown out paid way more money than I
04:30:34.800 should have been paid um to fly out and
04:30:36.880 consult with the sales team all right
04:30:38.080 they were selling mortgage leads example
04:30:39.359 I was giving earlier and they were
04:30:41.680 really excited and they wanted me to
04:30:42.800 give this ABC always be closing chat
04:30:45.159 like this huge PumpUp chat and so I
04:30:47.000 spent the first half of the day on the
04:30:48.119 script and the second half of the day
04:30:49.640 we're supposed to be drilling the sales
04:30:51.199 team right so I get on the sales team
04:30:52.520 they got I think had a nine person sales
04:30:53.840 floor and uh they're like we're having
04:30:56.159 some problems with this guy John I was
04:30:57.680 like all cool so I was like John how
04:31:01.520 good are the
04:31:02.640 leads he was
04:31:05.080 like well you know there's kind of and I
04:31:07.800 was like I'm good thank you and I was
04:31:09.399 like because if you [ __ ] thought the
04:31:11.439 leads were were good you would say dude
04:31:13.680 they're unreal I can't believe it right
04:31:15.000 now I'm getting my mom to pass her real
04:31:16.560 estate certification so I can start
04:31:17.800 sending her leads I'm studying for mine
04:31:19.199 I'm a couple months behind but I'm
04:31:20.479 telling you as soon as I [ __ ] get
04:31:21.920 this thing pass I'm out of here I'm G to
04:31:23.720 start buying these leads myself because
04:31:24.920 I make more than I make right now as a
04:31:25.880 sales
04:31:26.680 guy that's what you'd say if you
04:31:29.560 believed right the way you say and what
04:31:31.680 you'd say would be entirely different
04:31:33.479 and so one of the hacks on this by the
04:31:34.760 way has anyone ever gotten hot or has a
04:31:36.319 sales guy who got hot starts just
04:31:38.119 closing closing closing closing
04:31:40.279 anyone that becomes a sales training for
04:31:42.760 that
04:31:43.920 person because the way they asked the
04:31:46.680 question at what point how they
04:31:49.119 closed that's how it's perfect and so
04:31:51.720 they should study the best game footage
04:31:53.359 when they're on a streak and that's when
04:31:55.239 you can replicate it much more easily
04:31:57.040 because it's like in the wild you'll
04:31:58.199 witness it and that's when they're
04:31:59.159 Masters right in those moments all right
04:32:01.479 and so these are the actions that we do
04:32:02.800 so I'm transitioning into tactic for you
04:32:04.119 guys who have teams all right reread the
04:32:06.479 testimonials out loud daily in front of
04:32:08.000 your sales team if you got fresh ones
04:32:10.720 which you should read them makes their
04:32:13.319 day makes them feel like they're making
04:32:14.359 an impact right they're getting the [ __ ]
04:32:16.119 kicked out of them every single day
04:32:17.960 getting hung up on getting cussed at
04:32:19.720 getting told a [ __ ] off every day right
04:32:21.800 and like the best thing you can do is
04:32:23.159 give them a cup of coffee and says hey
04:32:24.439 man you're [ __ ] doing good in the
04:32:25.560 world right that's what they need so do
04:32:27.279 it every day number two fix everything
04:32:29.319 you can about the product this is
04:32:30.800 obvious but I want to say it directly
04:32:32.840 like don't blame the customer for a lack
04:32:34.119 of success because it doesn't help
04:32:35.239 anyone right doesn't help them doesn't
04:32:36.640 help us if we can take ownership then we
04:32:38.840 can fix the product right three never
04:32:41.279 stop improving it so you always know
04:32:42.640 it's up to date and this is a good one
04:32:43.720 for the sales team if you're sales dip
04:32:46.279 take your head of customer support bring
04:32:48.640 them to the sales meeting and say Erica
04:32:51.920 tell these guys what you do for our
04:32:53.159 customers they're like oh well the first
04:32:54.920 day what we do is we send them this text
04:32:56.119 and we send them this letter and then we
04:32:57.119 give them swag and then we follow up
04:32:58.720 with them and then we like write them a
04:33:00.239 handwritten card and we give them a back
04:33:01.359 massage and a foot massage and then we
04:33:02.720 find a wife for them it's unbelievable
04:33:04.199 you know what I mean and then the sales
04:33:05.438 guys are like God this is [ __ ]
04:33:06.840 awesome I'm like I know let's go sell it
04:33:08.958 right and so these are the actions that
04:33:10.680 you can do on a daily basis
04:33:12.680 to get your team to be excellent all
04:33:14.359 right and so that's how you can hack
04:33:15.719 conviction and get your team's tone
04:33:18.480 unconsciously correct by just truly
04:33:20.000 believing in the product is that cool
04:33:22.278 you think you'd sell more if you did
04:33:23.320 that hell yeah sweet thank you all right
04:33:26.958 conviction framework number two check
04:33:29.599 all right number three scaling framework
04:33:30.958 how to easily duplicate this process
04:33:32.080 across sales people in any niche in
04:33:34.118 seven days or less all right so we've
04:33:36.359 talked about closure framework we talked
04:33:37.480 about conviction framework and this is
04:33:39.320 the oops I think I going to skip one oh
04:33:41.039 no where you are back so when I showed
04:33:42.958 my sales team this stuff they didn't do
04:33:44.639 it every time all right because you're
04:33:45.919 probably going to come back from here
04:33:47.199 all gung-ho you might show them this
04:33:48.520 video and they're like yeah and they go
04:33:50.039 raw ra for two to three days and then
04:33:51.278 it's like back to normal right no one
04:33:52.759 wants that so piece by piece we
04:33:55.199 implemented processes to get the same
04:33:56.759 outcome over and over and over again
04:33:59.919 because of the $10 million we've sold
04:34:02.561 which is crazy it's been 100% over the
04:34:04.759 phone no one over the age of 20 no we
04:34:07.919 got one guy who's 40 but Bey besides him
04:34:10.520 everyone's younger than $27 $27 27 years
04:34:13.680 old all right like these aren't like
04:34:15.719 crazy you know what I mean like crazy
04:34:17.599 veterans right they just do this process
04:34:19.879 over again you get the right thing as a
04:34:22.000 total
04:34:22.840 aside find people and educate them about
04:34:25.840 your prospect not your
04:34:28.680 product that's a big [ __ ] up because
04:34:30.599 like they shouldn't even be talking that
04:34:31.680 much about the product they should be
04:34:33.199 knowing everything about the Prospect
04:34:35.118 and so right now if your sales training
04:34:36.359 is focused on your product Doing It
04:34:38.639 Wrong these are the six C's that I use
04:34:40.480 to scale teams from little guy to lots
04:34:43.480 of guys all right so this still a you
04:34:46.759 know we Ed this to build a 3,000 person
04:34:48.359 affiliate base in our physical Products
04:34:50.039 Company it added 35 million in sales
04:34:53.160 which is cool which is awesome and so I
04:34:55.400 will show you how this works all right
04:34:57.240 and so um we've used these sales teams
04:34:59.320 and this is how we've kind of these were
04:35:00.400 all multi-figure teams and I'll show you
04:35:02.000 what we did all right so closure
04:35:03.719 sequence is the first C which we went
04:35:05.359 over earlier the second C is consistent
04:35:07.919 daily training and conviction and I'll
04:35:09.240 show you how to do each of these call
04:35:11.000 recordings you got to record them
04:35:12.639 communication Cycles cuts and
04:35:15.039 competition those are the six C's all
04:35:17.799 right so number one make sure you have a
04:35:20.480 question based framework that follows
04:35:21.759 those steps in the script it should just
04:35:23.561 be questions it's so much easier to just
04:35:25.639 follow questions because if someone's
04:35:27.278 out and you know out in left field you
04:35:29.719 know wandering on like onto the highway
04:35:31.359 you're like whoa hey come back over here
04:35:33.160 this is the next question in this
04:35:34.400 process so thank you so much for sharing
04:35:36.039 that that must have been so hard for you
04:35:37.561 so what do you think that brought right
04:35:39.199 you go right into the next question the
04:35:40.278 sale all right
04:35:42.320 number two uh consistent daily training
04:35:44.799 this is the number one thing if you take
04:35:46.199 one thing away from this besides
04:35:47.400 conviction because that'll do more for
04:35:48.438 yourselves than anything this is the
04:35:49.879 second biggest thing all right is that
04:35:52.599 daily training our team trains 60
04:35:54.320 minutes a day five days a week we
04:35:56.199 actually do twice a day stuff but that's
04:35:58.438 okay anyways for right now if you just
04:35:59.759 do this you'll already be way better
04:36:01.278 than everyone else in your in your
04:36:02.160 Market all right so we do talking and
04:36:04.039 listening because a salesperson needs to
04:36:05.359 know how to speak the right tone you
04:36:08.480 know how to listen right and so we drill
04:36:10.359 both scales we're talking we have them
04:36:12.561 read the script out loud and the
04:36:13.719 questions with the correct tonality for
04:36:16.000 25 minutes and if they [ __ ] up they
04:36:18.320 start again simple five minutes we drill
04:36:22.080 obstacle overcomes I need to think about
04:36:23.799 it I'm not sure I don't have the money
04:36:26.400 can't afford that right now I got to
04:36:27.719 talk to my partner right I know what's
04:36:29.799 going to work in my market or whatever
04:36:31.160 your specific obstacles are because
04:36:32.759 those when they're in the Red Zone they
04:36:34.240 shouldn't have to think about those so
04:36:35.719 the only two things that someone will
04:36:36.840 ever truly memorize will be those 30
04:36:39.118 second anecdotal stories I mentioned
04:36:40.520 earlier and your obstacle overcomes it
04:36:42.639 makes it much easier to get new people
04:36:43.840 on the
04:36:44.919 team listening so every day we listen to
04:36:49.000 a 30 minute recording and we'll go with
04:36:51.278 what went right in this call what went
04:36:53.919 wrong what are you going to do next time
04:36:56.639 very simple right you play the call
04:36:59.118 everyone watches it's game tape review
04:37:01.359 we're like man you got kicked in the
04:37:02.480 balls on this one right but you had
04:37:05.240 great report in the first 5
04:37:06.879 minutes right um you're like what went
04:37:10.000 wrong and that was about it
04:37:12.639 um and what you going to do next time
04:37:13.680 I'm going to transition from the report
04:37:14.759 of the question asking without sounding
04:37:16.080 like a douchebag fantastic all right
04:37:18.240 next day and you continue to improve I
04:37:21.199 know this sounds crazy simple but it's
04:37:23.240 so simple no one will do it so number
04:37:25.639 three C's is call recordings if you
04:37:27.680 don't call like record your calls one
04:37:29.118 you're not compliant but two like how
04:37:31.000 are you going to study game film you
04:37:32.400 know what I mean everybody's got all
04:37:33.359 their data and you've got your mouse
04:37:34.919 tracking on all the pages I'm like how
04:37:36.240 where's the mouse tracking on the calls
04:37:38.240 right that's where that's where you're
04:37:39.000 going to train your team this is like
04:37:40.278 every NBA team they play game and they
04:37:41.919 watch the game footage right why are we
04:37:43.958 not doing that with the sales team and
04:37:45.320 so you have to record it if you use zoom
04:37:47.160 gong is absolutely the best highly
04:37:48.520 recommend it it's been awesome we us
04:37:49.599 this for two years they'll tell you
04:37:51.039 exactly how many minutes people are
04:37:52.160 talking versus someone else they'll tell
04:37:53.599 you who's talking the most where how
04:37:55.080 many questions were asked if the AI they
04:37:56.759 have there is unbelievable um it's
04:37:58.639 expensive but it's worth it four com
04:38:01.359 cycles and feedback um I don't know if
04:38:03.759 you guys have heard the story but if I
04:38:05.160 were trying to uh fix your golf swing
04:38:07.759 right and I said okay so I take a swing
04:38:11.520 looking like I do like a like an idiot
04:38:13.520 right he's like all right man well first
04:38:15.400 off lose 40 lbs so you can rotate all
04:38:17.520 right after you do that uh change your
04:38:19.520 wrist by two degrees turn your other
04:38:21.278 hand over put your thumb underneath I
04:38:23.039 need you to take your first foot put it
04:38:24.561 forward and then point it the other way
04:38:26.080 and then put this foot back and try
04:38:27.719 again I'm [ __ ] no chance of swinging
04:38:30.840 right but if he just said hey take
04:38:33.561 another 20 swins and just put one thumb
04:38:35.561 under the other one I'd have one thing
04:38:38.000 to work on I could probably get better
04:38:39.879 and so when you're training and this is
04:38:41.080 for the sales directors if you're
04:38:42.840 helping them out with that call what
04:38:44.799 went right what went wrong the what am I
04:38:46.919 going to do about it is the one thing do
04:38:49.199 that makees sense and so in terms of
04:38:50.840 communication Cycles we do weekly with
04:38:53.799 the team we've got daily training we've
04:38:57.199 got daily wrapup at the end which is
04:38:58.919 really just to pump up and kiss them on
04:39:00.240 the forehead good night to make sure
04:39:01.320 they feel okay right because they do get
04:39:03.160 punched in the face all day so it's it's
04:39:04.561 worth being like hey you see Derrick's
04:39:06.320 overcome this morning it's [ __ ]
04:39:07.520 awesome he killed it let's watch that as
04:39:08.919 like highlight footage like watch him
04:39:10.320 say he's going to have to talk to wife
04:39:12.438 Bo overcome right and then and then
04:39:14.639 they're like dude you killed it and then
04:39:15.719 it just makes them feel like they're
04:39:16.680 part of the team right and so that's
04:39:18.359 where we do the feedback and the
04:39:19.278 communication cycles and then we do once
04:39:20.719 a once a week if they're new we'll do
04:39:22.480 one of ones if they're a little bit
04:39:23.759 older we'll do once every other week
04:39:25.561 does that make sense can you use this
04:39:27.080 right now what I'm giving you for your
04:39:28.080 sales teams okay
04:39:30.359 sweet number five cut the fat cut it
04:39:34.118 fast um Randy probably knows this better
04:39:37.638 than
04:39:38.360 anyone when you hire sales people at
04:39:40.798 least in my experience like it's Sinker
04:39:43.840 swim like if a guys if guys can't close
04:39:46.400 in the first week to two weeks unless
04:39:47.760 it's some sort of crazy complex thing
04:39:49.680 they ain't closing right and then I've
04:39:51.360 got somebody who now came in neutral now
04:39:53.878 they feel like they suck right they're
04:39:55.840 actually worse than someone who's new
04:39:57.440 because now I got to overcome all your
04:39:58.360 beliefs and then bring you back up and
04:40:00.080 so in my experience it's been much
04:40:01.320 easier to take a six and get him to a
04:40:03.200 nine than try and take than try and take
04:40:05.080 a two and get him to a five it's more
04:40:07.440 work and it's not good for me or him
04:40:09.798 right does that make sense so in most
04:40:11.920 cases does anyone have a salesperson
04:40:13.798 that you've been waiting for them to
04:40:14.760 turn the corner for the last like six
04:40:16.480 months they're not going to turn the
04:40:18.200 corner unless they have like a come to
04:40:19.958 Jesus moment which does happen but it
04:40:21.718 doesn't need to happen on my team you
04:40:22.760 can do that and come back right all
04:40:25.718 right number six competition and career
04:40:28.638 path all right A big one so salespeople
04:40:32.080 are competitive right as they should be
04:40:34.600 right they are hunters and they should
04:40:35.760 go hunt and so having competition on a
04:40:37.840 regular basis what we have found is that
04:40:39.120 sixe Cycles tends to work best it is
04:40:40.760 long enough that believe they can
04:40:41.760 accomplish something but short enough
04:40:42.638 they believe it's going to happen soon
04:40:44.360 and so we run our competitions on six we
04:40:45.878 Cycles um for us I think what you said
04:40:49.120 uh whatever Ryan said about the
04:40:50.520 percentages 10 to 15% actually works
04:40:53.480 pretty well as like a group goal um when
04:40:55.718 we have those as like top salesperson we
04:40:57.440 like we did like weekend to Vegas so
04:40:58.760 we'll split all the guys up we like four
04:41:00.000 teams of four you know what I mean and
04:41:01.560 they're all comp so it's like you get
04:41:02.638 the the competitiveness but you still
04:41:04.080 get the camaraderie CU if it's just one
04:41:06.560 you know one versus everyone sometimes
04:41:07.840 they can get um a little bit too you
04:41:10.040 know teethy uh so having like little
04:41:12.000 mini teams helps too because then you
04:41:13.160 can you can kind of like make it an
04:41:14.400 adjusted draft you can put the best guy
04:41:15.680 with the worst guy and then he helps him
04:41:17.120 out and he speeds him up does that make
04:41:18.520 sense and then career path this is one
04:41:21.040 that I probably learned later but it's
04:41:22.520 really good is that you can have minor
04:41:26.958 Minor Road uh Milestones like 50 deals
04:41:30.360 closed 100 deals closed 150 deals closed
04:41:33.200 right and they just get a little just a
04:41:34.798 little you know they go from 500 a deal
04:41:37.200 to 525 a deal right they go from 525 a
04:41:39.600 deal to 550 a deal just the fact fact
04:41:41.480 that there's this this road map of where
04:41:43.440 they're going and there's actual
04:41:44.920 progress because sales is one of the
04:41:46.440 most repetitive positions in the
04:41:48.840 world just the fact that they're doing
04:41:50.920 this and they something is changing on
04:41:52.440 the outside I think just helps relieve
04:41:54.798 anxiety and help the guys Focus so that
04:41:56.958 is one of the things that I would
04:41:57.718 recommend doing um with the career path
04:41:59.400 and then obviously if you have roles
04:42:00.600 like depending how big your team is
04:42:01.920 manager Etc and you can move up um
04:42:04.120 something that I don't have on here that
04:42:05.480 I will add is that um this seems to be
04:42:08.680 common practice but remember dumbest
04:42:10.240 marketer on Earth um outbound and
04:42:12.798 inbound uh keep them separated we also
04:42:15.680 have Setters and closers for both of
04:42:17.120 those teams so outbound sets are
04:42:19.080 different than inbound sets which go to
04:42:21.280 different in closers on either side
04:42:23.520 right because the prospects are a little
04:42:24.840 bit different right and so if you if you
04:42:27.000 have lots of different types of leads
04:42:28.878 going to the same person you're probably
04:42:30.600 losing a lot of efficiency and if you
04:42:32.000 don't have that much lead flow that's
04:42:33.160 another issue but it's it's as soon as
04:42:35.718 you can separating them out will get you
04:42:37.040 a lot a lot higher conversion rates all
04:42:39.440 right so I'll recap this this six for
04:42:41.560 scale in our closure sequence make sure
04:42:42.798 that's it's in a question based
04:42:43.480 framework daily trainings and conviction
04:42:45.958 so you're reading the testimonies every
04:42:47.160 day you're training them every morning
04:42:48.280 on talking listing the most valuable
04:42:49.400 skills that a Salesman can have call
04:42:51.080 recordings to make sure that they're
04:42:52.120 actually doing you have game tap footage
04:42:53.200 to actually look at communication Cycles
04:42:55.280 to actually improve on their skills
04:42:56.560 based on the game footage that we just
04:42:57.718 had you cut the bottom people who are
04:42:59.560 just dragging the team down that
04:43:01.040 probably just don't have the makeup for
04:43:02.480 this and then you keep it competitive
04:43:04.400 and you give them a career past so they
04:43:05.560 have something to look forward to in the
04:43:06.440 future all right and so uh now you can
04:43:09.040 understand how anyone can sell expensive
04:43:09.958 flx paper Pro even if you don't think
04:43:11.680 you're any good which is completely
04:43:14.080 normal yeah that's sales
