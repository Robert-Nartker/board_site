# 3 Hours of Money Making Advice You Needed To Know Yesterday
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/TooAB8Ow6cQ

00:00:00.040 I just spent 8 hours with the top 10
00:00:02.440 business owners on school from last
00:00:04.160 month sharing the money-making
00:00:05.480 strategies that they used to win the
00:00:07.799 school games here are the best ones the
00:00:09.960 first thing we talked about affected
00:00:11.679 every business in the room and yours
00:00:13.480 which is how to get more leads and how
00:00:14.759 to turn those into customers so it's
00:00:16.279 using a free school group okay okay so
00:00:19.119 essentially what we do is we create like
00:00:21.560 content on YouTube um Instagram stories
00:00:23.599 we're doing a bit of cold Outreach as
00:00:24.960 well I that it didn't really help with
00:00:26.400 this so you're doing content yeah but it
00:00:28.880 was content is one of them you're doing
00:00:31.560 Outreach to the people who follow and
00:00:33.640 all that stuff on your content yeah and
00:00:35.920 um also we were get like School organic
00:00:37.960 traffic as well yeah starting to do that
00:00:41.360 yeah what ranking are
00:00:43.520 you ranking your pre group like you know
00:00:46.199 you're in Discovery a no idea like we
00:00:48.559 didn't optimize for that I am be worth
00:00:51.760 looking at how many do you know how many
00:00:53.280 searches a day we get on school I don't
00:00:56.600 know a like yeah there there's a lot
00:01:01.800 um but the pro honestly there's more
00:01:05.280 visits to profiles that makes sense yeah
00:01:08.119 and then they go profile and way more
00:01:10.200 traffic goes through the profiles but so
00:01:12.320 you have so you have content you have
00:01:13.759 Outreach um we'll get you don't worry
00:01:15.640 about it um we've content we have
00:01:17.560 outreached what are you what what else
00:01:18.720 are you doing yeah it's like the school
00:01:20.040 organic so people just clicking my
00:01:21.479 profile um and it also being other
00:01:24.720 people's profiles as well you know they
00:01:26.360 just join our curiosity so we then get
00:01:28.600 those people they join the free school
00:01:30.040 group as well so promote on like
00:01:31.600 whatever platforms so how do they um so
00:01:34.240 in in each of these so you make content
00:01:36.360 and do you have it in like the
00:01:37.799 description and do you integrate into
00:01:39.799 the content like hey yeah so I just like
00:01:41.520 leave the link in the description also
00:01:43.040 I'd put in my Instagram bio so actually
00:01:44.840 in YouTube videos where I just promoted
00:01:46.280 my Instagram people would join the
00:01:47.600 Instagram or follow me on Instagram and
00:01:49.479 they just join the community I have
00:01:50.840 curiosity even though I didn't promote
00:01:52.399 it was just in the bio um with the
00:01:54.320 Outreach we didn't promote the free
00:01:55.479 group that's only like if people weren't
00:01:57.360 interested which like okay we got this
00:01:58.759 free group you might want to join it and
00:02:00.719 then with school people just join
00:02:02.079 naturally okay um I say Biol links plus
00:02:06.479 description yeah okay got that and so
00:02:10.000 and what's in there is that the the free
00:02:11.480 group or the the paid group uh it's all
00:02:13.400 free Okay so this this goes to the free
00:02:16.519 group free score got
00:02:19.440 it all right what else okay so when they
00:02:22.200 join to get the auto DM which is the
00:02:23.959 first line of our DM script okay and
00:02:26.720 then we also in the classroom section so
00:02:28.720 we have like a start here post that
00:02:30.280 tells them to go to the classroom so DM
00:02:33.280 as soon as they join the free school
00:02:35.239 yeah okay yeah it's all on the free
00:02:36.800 group got it okay and then we also have
00:02:39.040 like a start here like pinned post that
00:02:40.760 tells people to watch a course and
00:02:42.120 there's a pinned course as well so
00:02:44.599 that's in the classroom section and the
00:02:46.319 course is essentially like a perfect
00:02:47.680 webinar by Russell Brunson like we kind
00:02:49.879 of break it into a course but it's like
00:02:51.080 a perfect webinar yeah and it
00:02:52.599 indoctrinates them to like book a call
00:02:54.480 and then we just close them on the call
00:02:56.040 and then we also did the DMS as well
00:03:01.480 so you CTA to call and then what do you
00:03:04.120 do to maintain the value in the
00:03:05.640 community yeah so our community is
00:03:07.519 actually it's extremely like inactive so
00:03:10.080 I just put po like now and then but like
00:03:13.360 it's like the members who are inactive
00:03:14.760 are the ones buying though it's like cuz
00:03:16.879 they they you have like zombies or like
00:03:19.000 dead bodies there yeah so like the free
00:03:20.560 community has I think it had like 400ish
00:03:22.920 members 450 is and we got like 53 sales
00:03:26.480 so it was very like high converting yeah
00:03:28.680 yeah so it's pretty active but the
00:03:30.280 community was dead but yeah people so
00:03:32.959 you converted 14% of people who went to
00:03:34.640 your free thing yeah ex into your got it
00:03:37.480 and did you convert them into just a a
00:03:38.920 higher ticket paid Community is that
00:03:40.200 what it was yes it was $999 yeah got it
00:03:42.280 that's why it's did by the way H because
00:03:44.680 you just took the most engage people in
00:03:46.599 mov but your I is engaged yeah that's
00:03:49.920 completely
00:03:52.200 accur basically you take your most
00:03:54.599 engaged people and you take them out and
00:03:56.640 put them somewhere else and like talk
00:03:57.879 here inste of course it makes just total
00:04:00.799 sense no it's like the people who are
00:04:02.280 inactive were joining the the high
00:04:04.439 because they're active there yeah yeah
00:04:07.480 it's true that's actually
00:04:09.640 true no that's exactly why yeah yeah and
00:04:14.000 we also tested this with someone else as
00:04:15.799 well so um he was going to enter the
00:04:17.880 school games but he just kind of gave up
00:04:19.798 but he was making like $500 a month and
00:04:22.720 we got him to $10,900 this month so what
00:04:25.199 the fun of was was Tik Tok and Instagram
00:04:27.840 real short form content School community
00:04:30.440 exact same process and basically 20 ex's
00:04:33.160 income so literally just drawing I mean
00:04:36.039 I I was saying this the other day cuz um
00:04:38.199 somebody asked me this question I think
00:04:39.320 on a Q&A call but it's like how do I
00:04:41.160 convert people from free to paid and I
00:04:43.039 still think that the single simplest way
00:04:44.800 to do that is just like depending on the
00:04:47.199 price point like if it's a low ticket
00:04:48.800 paid then you just add the onboarding
00:04:50.600 call to personalize their experience
00:04:51.919 which then it's like hey what are your
00:04:53.080 goals what are your obstacles right now
00:04:54.479 you know what you might be really good
00:04:55.320 fifth or whatever and then you can just
00:04:57.000 sell straight into it um if it's high TI
00:04:59.840 then you have your you know your vsl or
00:05:02.440 your webinar or whatever that you
00:05:03.639 incorporate into their onboarding
00:05:04.840 process and allow them to self- select
00:05:06.440 if it's a you know $5,000 or whatever
00:05:08.759 you know Plus offer that's probably the
00:05:10.880 most I can imagine that would be the
00:05:12.919 most widely adopted method this one yeah
00:05:16.639 yeah it's simple it's the most easy to
00:05:18.759 understand I mean I almost didn't
00:05:20.120 understand anything else that I heard
00:05:21.919 but that yeah I've seen that be used
00:05:25.080 over and over and over again like in a
00:05:27.039 lot of slightly different ways but cuz a
00:05:30.080 free community if you've got content and
00:05:32.280 then you're promising a free community
00:05:33.600 conversion rates are through the roow
00:05:35.479 it's the most efficient mechanism to
00:05:37.240 convert it's a lead magnet I mean
00:05:38.639 fundamentally community and like on the
00:05:41.000 free community as well you make like
00:05:42.960 indoctrination Parts it's like you know
00:05:44.880 how Russell Bruns talks about like the
00:05:46.080 internal belief the external beliefs you
00:05:48.360 you just basically shatter all their
00:05:49.720 limiting beliefs you need to make a note
00:05:51.400 to make a training on yeah I I'm going
00:05:53.479 to simple I'm going to do a simple
00:05:54.759 version of this which is
00:05:56.479 just
00:05:58.039 traffic free group
00:06:00.840 yep free school it's the group funnel
00:06:04.840 yeah free
00:06:06.840 school we already have that
00:06:09.120 training yeah but it's old and in the
00:06:11.240 wrong
00:06:13.080 place and it was for high ticket yeah
00:06:15.680 and it's for yeah exactly exactly that
00:06:17.840 works so
00:06:19.120 well I it's probably the most common
00:06:21.360 Ping On school is I think someone didn't
00:06:23.280 an analysis that almost everyone ranking
00:06:26.160 in Discovery and Lead boards has two
00:06:28.039 groups one free one paid it's like the
00:06:31.639 yeah the funnel it's the tactic and it
00:06:34.120 works yeah so this like for everybody at
00:06:37.639 home traffic free school DM to web plus
00:06:42.319 Al basically you just drive everything
00:06:43.479 there so your PIN post there you make
00:06:45.280 content you soft toss it be like hey
00:06:46.840 make sure you watch this the pitch in
00:06:48.039 the classroom which kind of is disarming
00:06:50.360 cuz you're like oh this isn't a webinar
00:06:52.560 yeah it's it's a
00:06:55.360 module and we've got some people to
00:06:57.639 rather than making like one long video
00:06:59.000 cuz this is why teach the students is to
00:07:00.639 break it up into small videos and like
00:07:03.160 distribute the webinar like that make it
00:07:05.000 not look like yeah it's like there's
00:07:07.840 four videos an introduction and then
00:07:09.319 three core stories and the fifth video
00:07:10.919 is I've got this thing for you and it
00:07:12.599 puts everyone off guard as well cuz like
00:07:14.319 I don't sign up to webinars anymore cuz
00:07:15.919 like I'm in that space this just putts
00:07:17.560 people off guard completely yeah every
00:07:19.840 step of this is like extremely efficient
00:07:22.680 cuz like I know if you have a link in
00:07:24.720 BIO to a free group it absolutely
00:07:26.720 crushes like those groups are the ones
00:07:28.759 that at the top of Discovery cuz it's
00:07:30.680 just so efficient we see 80% conversion
00:07:32.919 rates on the pages like and so you get
00:07:36.680 them in and then the autod DM sends like
00:07:40.479 100% of people and then you put them to
00:07:43.919 that module and that module it starts
00:07:46.080 the funnel and the funnel is like module
00:07:47.680 one module two yeah and then you get
00:07:49.879 them onto a call yeah which is probably
00:07:52.960 going to be the most efficient method at
00:07:54.759 converting free to paid yeah and some
00:07:57.199 people they don't even book the course
00:07:58.560 they watch the course they don't book
00:07:59.560 the call but then when you DM them
00:08:01.319 they're like oh yeah I've watched the
00:08:02.360 course and then they do it so it's like
00:08:04.120 so you DM again so basically after they
00:08:06.120 watch it you follow up DM no so we just
00:08:08.159 DM them anyway but some people just they
00:08:10.199 watch the course and then book or
00:08:11.599 they'll book later on they'll just come
00:08:13.039 back to it and as long as you're making
00:08:14.599 the post then they're like they find
00:08:16.080 they go back to the course to get the
00:08:17.240 link and then they book it yeah how much
00:08:19.520 is the thing that you're selling them
00:08:20.919 the paid group so it's $9.99 a month
00:08:24.440 okay but this could work even for a
00:08:26.919 cheaper thing like like you don't have
00:08:29.240 to do high ticket you don't even you
00:08:30.879 don't even have to do a call actually it
00:08:32.760 could just be selling a $99 month thing
00:08:35.760 over DMS and maybe even a call cuz for
00:08:38.240 I'm just thinking for beginners you need
00:08:40.839 cuz you don't have a ton of traffic and
00:08:42.440 a ton of
00:08:44.200 like like privileges to work with
00:08:47.000 essentially you have to like get the
00:08:49.080 most efficient conversion at every point
00:08:52.080 right cuz you're looking to squeeze
00:08:53.760 every last drop it's also I mean this is
00:08:56.839 also from a from a technical complexity
00:08:59.200 like this is pretty simple like click to
00:09:02.160 free free to you make the five modules
00:09:05.600 and then you talk to them and ask them
00:09:08.160 but yeah this is the most effective it
00:09:09.360 works amazingly well as well because
00:09:11.519 especially with the short form content
00:09:12.800 this is something I realized recently um
00:09:14.880 so the guy was working with he had like
00:09:16.200 900 members he made one post and like
00:09:18.240 800 people joined we were like that's
00:09:20.760 insane and of course we booked like
00:09:22.320 hundreds of sales calls from that yeah
00:09:24.800 it's monster this is very simple I like
00:09:26.959 this a
00:09:27.839 lot do this
00:09:30.959 this is great really good the the thing
00:09:33.120 that I I keep I keep this is me making a
00:09:35.880 bet um is that I will bet that there's
00:09:38.240 going to be a lot more ,000 a month type
00:09:42.040 quote high ticket like shifting over um
00:09:45.200 partially because of what you noticed
00:09:46.680 which is if you can double or triple
00:09:49.160 acquisition because it's LTV to CAC
00:09:51.200 ratio and so you can still drive down
00:09:52.880 CAC a lot to improve that ratio and so I
00:09:56.880 think I mean the the space always has
00:09:58.760 like a vibe like you have like the rank
00:10:00.279 and rent which is kind of coming back
00:10:01.720 right I think in the high ticket world
00:10:03.279 there's a lot of a lot of people have
00:10:05.560 like the pendulum swung a little bit
00:10:06.920 this way and I think it's kind of coming
00:10:08.519 back just a tiny bit um where people
00:10:10.959 this is why like brand and content ahe
00:10:12.880 and like value in advance is becoming
00:10:14.279 more and more important because there's
00:10:15.360 not a lot of trust and to be fair there
00:10:16.920 was there will always be less and less
00:10:18.279 trust over time um and the more mature
00:10:20.440 the platforms get the less just eyeball
00:10:22.480 Arbitrage exists like if you remember
00:10:24.240 for that 5 Seconds that Clubhouse was a
00:10:26.360 thing like I had I knew plenty of people
00:10:28.600 who went on there and then we're doing
00:10:30.440 like 100,000 a day on clubhouse because
00:10:33.800 it was just it was just huge Arbitrage
00:10:35.480 of eyeballs they're getting way more
00:10:36.839 exposure than they normally would but as
00:10:38.839 platforms kind of settle then it's like
00:10:41.519 okay whose legit starts to rise and who
00:10:43.200 makes the best content and things like
00:10:44.360 that and so right now there's not like
00:10:45.839 besid school there's not like a another
00:10:47.600 platform that's really like emerging and
00:10:50.240 so um it's my belief that that's why I
00:10:53.000 trust that's why content stuff is so
00:10:54.639 important is because it'll improve
00:10:55.720 conversion across the funnel and I think
00:10:57.639 that this whole um
00:11:00.440 $1,000 a month like instead of being the
00:11:02.959 $3,000 $4,000 a month I think a lot more
00:11:05.760 people are willing to stomach the $999 a
00:11:07.959 month um because they can see and as
00:11:10.000 soon as we roll out more stuff with like
00:11:11.399 reviews and things like that it'll just
00:11:13.240 make it more and more trusted and I was
00:11:15.040 talking um the other day about this but
00:11:17.320 like if I could start gimmal launch all
00:11:19.720 over again the probably the biggest
00:11:21.800 thing that I would have done differently
00:11:23.360 is I would have probably tried to make
00:11:25.120 it like 10 grand a year and I would have
00:11:28.240 put all my focus on how do I keep 80 90%
00:11:31.399 of my customers
00:11:32.800 renewing and um that would have been my
00:11:35.880 main focus like I just want such a crazy
00:11:37.760 valued price discrepancy that no one
00:11:39.720 would leave um and they would refer more
00:11:42.399 people etc etc because I would have
00:11:43.800 probably acquired two three four times
00:11:46.440 the customers but they also would have
00:11:48.560 stuck uh longer because like over the
00:11:50.959 last however many years we've done like
00:11:52.120 5,500 locations that have gone through
00:11:54.639 gym launch and like if all 5,500 of
00:11:57.560 those locations were still paying me I'd
00:11:59.800 be richer than I am today um and so I I
00:12:02.360 think about that a lot of like sure
00:12:04.560 there's on one hit like when you don't
00:12:06.160 know how to sell it's very exciting to
00:12:08.120 like start Rising your price and be like
00:12:09.800 oh my God I just sold 10,000 oh my God I
00:12:11.560 sold 20,00 oh my God 100,000 like it
00:12:13.680 gets really cool but once you learn how
00:12:16.160 to acquire customers you then become
00:12:17.639 completely obsessed on the other side
00:12:19.160 which is oh shoot you realize the game
00:12:21.519 like Sam and I have talked about this at
00:12:23.000 length which is you don't want to keep
00:12:25.560 having to go get customers I mean of
00:12:27.519 course you have like you want be able to
00:12:29.800 go get customers but not to have to go
00:12:31.680 get customers and so like that's the big
00:12:33.920 difference and so like when I look at
00:12:34.959 businesses now I care almost exclusively
00:12:37.760 about how much does this thing grow on
00:12:39.600 Word of Mouth how much like what
00:12:40.959 percentage of customers stay every year
00:12:43.240 once they're like in and activated and
00:12:44.839 whatnot because then it means that I get
00:12:46.920 credit for customers I sold two years
00:12:48.440 ago and so even if you sold 100
00:12:50.320 customers a year if you can keep all of
00:12:51.880 them 10 years from now you're 10 times
00:12:53.199 bigger and so the vast majority of like
00:12:55.160 the internet marketing World focuses on
00:12:57.000 growing by simply selling more units
00:12:58.440 because they can't keep it body but the
00:13:00.360 people who make the most money just
00:13:01.560 don't lose customers but you have to
00:13:03.680 like learn how to sell in order to get
00:13:05.079 there but like this is kind of the
00:13:06.440 evolution that happens and so pricing I
00:13:08.720 like my thoughts on pricing has changed
00:13:10.440 from the the old school Dan Kennedy
00:13:12.199 model which is like say as high of a
00:13:13.959 price as you can without cracking a
00:13:15.199 smile um like i' swung back a little bit
00:13:17.959 more to like well let's just make them
00:13:20.399 smile at how Blown Away they are with
00:13:22.839 the value that we have and then they're
00:13:24.519 more likely to tell their friends more
00:13:26.000 likely to stay longer and then like I
00:13:28.480 wildly under underestimate how how much
00:13:31.360 Word of Mouth affects these businesses
00:13:34.760 like some of you guys have probably
00:13:36.160 bought coaching courses and whatnot
00:13:38.240 because a friend of yours was like I
00:13:39.639 went through his YouTube training it was
00:13:40.680 actually really good and then that guy
00:13:42.800 doesn't know that you were told that he
00:13:44.560 just sees an ad and he sees a conversion
00:13:46.560 he's like oh my ads are killing it but
00:13:48.639 it's not that it's cuz the product's
00:13:50.160 really good and so like in the early
00:13:52.440 days of gym launch we got 100 to one
00:13:53.839 return on Advertising it wasn't because
00:13:55.720 my ads were exceptional it's because
00:13:56.920 everybody who was going through was just
00:13:58.000 printing money
00:13:59.639 and so like that's the that's the the
00:14:02.120 big shift and those are the guys who
00:14:04.160 make the most money there the ones who
00:14:05.560 actually have a pretty good product in
00:14:06.759 the second clip we talk about pricing
00:14:08.399 and I talk about pricing a lot because
00:14:10.079 pricing has the strongest lever on
00:14:11.959 profit more than getting more customers
00:14:13.880 more than even retaining them longer
00:14:15.839 nailing pricing will make you more money
00:14:17.759 than any other skill I have a question
00:14:19.839 on the pricing because I did you know
00:14:22.320 the what you said charge as high of a
00:14:23.880 price and I tried to increase it but I
00:14:25.519 didn't follow the principle of only
00:14:27.199 increase the price after sufficiently
00:14:28.600 increasing
00:14:29.720 I notic the people are much more likely
00:14:32.040 to ask for a refund at the higher price
00:14:33.959 before it was 77 a month now it's 137
00:14:36.360 mhm should I suggest going down to 87
00:14:39.040 which is still bigger than the previous
00:14:40.240 price or it's not a huge price change
00:14:43.079 okay yeah just 77 to 137 is not like a m
00:14:45.800 i mean it's a there's definitely going
00:14:46.959 to be a jump in terms of conversion or
00:14:48.800 like rather a drop in conversions um but
00:14:53.000 the all all you're optimizing for is
00:14:56.480 conversion rate times LTV
00:14:59.199 that's like that's the whole equation so
00:15:00.959 we talked about the four levers in this
00:15:02.240 business right like you've got traffic
00:15:03.920 you've got conversion you've got price
00:15:05.800 and you've got churn like those are the
00:15:07.800 four levers so like to grow the business
00:15:09.480 you have to increase well decrease turn
00:15:11.639 but increase the other three right and
00:15:14.199 so if you know that let's say you've got
00:15:16.240 100 clicks to a page let's say at 77 you
00:15:18.839 convert twice as many customers well it
00:15:21.120 comes down to really just like what's
00:15:22.120 your earning per eyeball and in the
00:15:24.079 affiliate world it's called epcs which
00:15:25.360 is earning per click and so you just
00:15:27.399 literally want to make the most money
00:15:28.720 per click over the longest period of
00:15:30.600 time and so now if the 77 converts at
00:15:33.560 twice the percentage of the 137 and they
00:15:36.160 turn at half the rate then over when you
00:15:38.480 do that hypothetical Max calculation
00:15:41.199 you'll you'll be like you literally all
00:15:42.759 of this is just math you just plot the
00:15:45.360 see what it looks like see where it
00:15:46.839 maxes out see what the other one maxes
00:15:48.399 out at and you're like okay that's the
00:15:49.759 price so how would I do that if I'm
00:15:51.880 sending people straight from YouTube to
00:15:53.720 about page on school you look at what
00:15:56.120 it's at at 137 or whatever and then you
00:15:58.440 know you what your metrics were at 77
00:16:00.399 mhm right and so you just compare what's
00:16:02.480 the so here let's do the math so let's
00:16:06.240 say you've got 77 bucks oops there we go
00:16:08.839 that's a seven all right there we go uh
00:16:11.440 and what was turn on 77 well I don't
00:16:13.600 have the exact number so that's another
00:16:15.560 issue obviously yeah yeah okay like
00:16:18.240 let's just walk through it
00:16:19.560 hypothetically months average would stay
00:16:21.560 people okay so that would be 33% churn
00:16:24.160 right yeah and so you divide that by I
00:16:26.079 have bad numbers because I started it
00:16:27.519 like few months ago you're fine don't
00:16:28.720 wor about on 147 is probably like two
00:16:30.600 months only okay
00:16:35.199 cool all right so 137 divided 50% turn
00:16:39.000 means you just double 137 right and so
00:16:41.600 you've got uh what is that 200 and uh
00:16:46.440 74 is LTV here and then here you've got
00:16:50.279 uh what's that divide times three uh1
00:16:54.000 what was that 241 thank you 24 241 41
00:16:59.519 31 Okay cool so LTV here is bigger than
00:17:02.959 here but then the question comes into
00:17:05.000 conversion right which happens before
00:17:06.839 this so then you're like all right what
00:17:11.199 percentage of clicks do I convert here
00:17:12.720 what percentage of clicks do I convert
00:17:14.039 here and so can someone do
00:17:16.799 um uh 274 divid
00:17:20.880 231 for me 1.86 1.86 yeah right so if
00:17:26.839 you can convert more than 20% more on
00:17:29.600 this one than this one this makes you
00:17:31.679 more money does that make sense yeah and
00:17:34.200 how would I track that if I'm sending
00:17:35.400 people from YouTube straight to school
00:17:37.200 about you've got to just use some like
00:17:39.160 fancy guess
00:17:42.480 work but you should have got a feel of
00:17:44.919 like when you were making a video a link
00:17:48.320 how many kind of members joined yeah
00:17:51.240 okay and do you know if there was a big
00:17:53.679 drop or if it kind of stayed the same I
00:17:55.960 mean there probably was a decrease but
00:17:57.679 not you know more than 20% or what well
00:18:01.159 20% might be hard to feel yeah because
00:18:03.320 it' be like one day you get four one day
00:18:04.760 you get three like five like that might
00:18:06.640 be tough to feel um but I know that that
00:18:09.559 metric's coming out soon anyways for us
00:18:11.559 so once as soon as that conversion
00:18:12.760 metric's on there I've already looked at
00:18:14.080 it by the way like L conversion rates
00:18:17.000 across the platform there's a the
00:18:19.760 biggest indicator is the price obviously
00:18:21.880 yeah right yeah I mean some free groups
00:18:23.720 convert it
00:18:25.039 80% um but the difference
00:18:30.960 between you know something that's like
00:18:34.280 10 20 30 those things can convert like
00:18:38.679 5% but once you get a price that's like
00:18:42.679 over 100 it drops significantly yeah
00:18:46.559 yeah and so here we know what each of
00:18:49.240 these is worth and so you're just
00:18:51.039 thinking what percentage of people buy
00:18:52.640 it and that's the
00:18:54.120 conversion and so if 50% more people buy
00:18:56.840 this then you're like okay well then 50%
00:19:00.200 even I'm making 50% more sales at this
00:19:02.720 price versus uh I mean this is just a
00:19:05.880 classic like chart of pricing versus
00:19:07.919 volume that's all it is I really want to
00:19:11.120 make to make sure it makes sense though
00:19:12.440 yeah okay this is how you figure out
00:19:14.880 pricing and I would just encourage you
00:19:16.799 guys to be willing to test like the um
00:19:19.799 PC who who just sold profit well um they
00:19:23.120 did this big meta study but basically uh
00:19:25.760 the more frequently you analyze price
00:19:28.000 the more profitable your company is just
00:19:30.320 it's like a direct correlation so
00:19:31.880 companies that never look at their price
00:19:32.960 or never adjust their price are way less
00:19:34.960 profitable than ones that look at it
00:19:36.000 annually which are less profitable than
00:19:37.400 the ones that look at quarterly so just
00:19:39.480 be willing to test price I got some
00:19:41.200 questions for you though like which one
00:19:42.760 do you think is making you more money on
00:19:45.440 your traffic cuz your traffic's probably
00:19:47.080 remained somewhat a constant right well
00:19:49.559 I'm not pushing as hard as during the
00:19:51.039 school games you know because was
00:19:52.440 selling every video and I don't want to
00:19:53.880 do that for long-term brand so it's hard
00:19:56.080 to compare but I would say it's more
00:19:57.799 like the Optics of being less than 100 a
00:20:00.080 month feels like different you know than
00:20:03.280 over 100 a month so which one do you
00:20:05.000 think was more efficient probably 77
00:20:07.600 because it's like I feel like the
00:20:09.480 product has more more aligned with the
00:20:11.720 value there your your audience is
00:20:13.720 younger on G side no they not 25 to
00:20:17.840 60 well I'll tell you personally we had
00:20:19.880 a portfolio company that we ran um this
00:20:22.520 is like this you guys might find this
00:20:23.880 really interesting hey guys if you want
00:20:25.200 to be in this room it's actually free
00:20:27.640 for all these people is they won the
00:20:29.440 school games and so school is a
00:20:31.240 community platform it helps you build a
00:20:32.720 group and a community that you can
00:20:34.000 monetize online or that you can build
00:20:35.440 for free and so we give you the tools we
00:20:38.600 give you the training and we give you
00:20:40.240 the community so that you can actually
00:20:41.840 recreate that and as of right now
00:20:44.400 54.1% of people who start a paid
00:20:46.440 community on school make at least $1 and
00:20:48.760 so I say that because the first dollar
00:20:51.200 in business is the hardest one to make
00:20:53.240 because there's so many skills that
00:20:54.640 require to get there and we've been
00:20:56.039 obsessing about this for the last 5
00:20:58.280 years to make it as easy as humanly
00:21:00.720 possible if you want to start for free
00:21:02.440 you can go check it out and if you want
00:21:03.600 to ask me a question I onboard all the
00:21:06.200 new customers every single Monday so
00:21:08.799 sign up start for free and I'll see you
00:21:10.640 next Monday it's school.com games so we
00:21:13.480 ran uh we ran We R in a high ticket
00:21:16.240 upsell and we tested 50k 35k 25k and 15K
00:21:21.200 wildly different price points I'm just I
00:21:23.799 love this [ __ ] um and so what's really
00:21:26.159 interesting is that the conversion rate
00:21:29.159 time basically the revenue we generated
00:21:31.039 from all four of those was
00:21:33.880 identical and so on one hand you might
00:21:36.360 think oh I'd rather just have fewer
00:21:38.440 customers at
00:21:40.440 $50,000 but for me personally I would
00:21:42.919 rather have more people that I can again
00:21:45.200 what's my Valu price discrepancy as
00:21:47.480 provided the cost of goods is not like
00:21:49.120 you know like I don't want to eat into
00:21:50.360 you know crazy margins or something but
00:21:51.840 provided the margin on all you know all
00:21:53.520 the the the services are still pretty
00:21:55.120 good I would rather have four times the
00:21:57.760 customers to then sell keep and then
00:22:00.120 also have a crazy like in terms of Word
00:22:02.480 of Mouth from those people saying that
00:22:04.320 my thing is unbelievable that make sense
00:22:07.080 do you know what I've noticed like high
00:22:08.640 ticket you can like change your price
00:22:10.919 and conversion doesn't move but with the
00:22:13.520 lower ticket it really does yeah which I
00:22:16.400 think it's because it's more intimate
00:22:18.760 like when you buy something that's real
00:22:20.600 high ticket you're it's small and you're
00:22:22.559 talking to a human and everything but
00:22:23.840 when it's lower ticket it it it does
00:22:26.200 seem to make a big difference because I
00:22:28.840 high take it fundamentally if you
00:22:29.960 believe you're going to get this big
00:22:31.000 expensive outcome then logically 25k and
00:22:34.080 35k like if you go and make a billion
00:22:36.240 dollar business they're both worth it
00:22:38.799 like right um it just like comes down to
00:22:41.559 whether you can actually afford the you
00:22:43.400 know the difference and so I think it
00:22:44.600 becomes like a structural conversion
00:22:46.440 difference where what I mean by that is
00:22:47.960 like some people literally can't afford
00:22:49.640 the difference between you know 15K
00:22:52.080 versus 50k like there are just some
00:22:53.840 people who just literally can't afford
00:22:54.960 it even though they both might want to
00:22:56.240 buy it um but yeah here you're you're
00:22:58.720 selling in in a you're alone it's like
00:23:01.240 you with the your finger over the button
00:23:02.720 you're
00:23:03.480 like I mean my fear is that if I
00:23:05.919 decrease it to 87 I would piss off all
00:23:07.880 the people that joined at 147 yeah so
00:23:10.360 like how would I test the price then H
00:23:13.520 well the worst case is they could cancel
00:23:15.240 and come back not the end of the world
00:23:18.520 because so just just for everybody here
00:23:20.120 like just from a perspective um taking
00:23:23.000 if you plan on having this business for
00:23:24.279 a long time then it's not going to make
00:23:25.559 any difference like you figuring out
00:23:27.520 what the right price point is for your
00:23:28.720 community is going to be the thing that
00:23:29.799 matters most and so like you might lose
00:23:32.279 a month like you're turning already at
00:23:33.919 whatever 50% they're going to be gone in
00:23:35.400 two months anyways yeah so like I'm just
00:23:37.840 being like really real right so like you
00:23:40.440 we want to tweak this stuff to get right
00:23:42.039 High by the way yeah like that's way
00:23:43.720 above the which do I aim for at this
00:23:45.480 price point below 20% yeah
00:23:48.640 okay like good is good is like in
00:23:52.480 between 5 and 10 yeah like
00:23:56.080 20% is like average is yeah cuz I I
00:23:59.679 actually analyzed yeah I actually put
00:24:01.960 the whole platform's numbers into profit
00:24:03.840 well oh sick yeah that took profit well
00:24:06.640 for like 7 days to to process it and it
00:24:10.320 almost broke it um cuz there's like 50
00:24:14.440 transactions a second almost um but it's
00:24:18.880 like yeah the that's probably around the
00:24:21.760 average what's interesting is it's
00:24:23.240 coming down every month because I think
00:24:25.399 people are learning more about what
00:24:27.080 works and what doesn't work
00:24:29.200 um but the good ones are sub 10 but so
00:24:32.480 if you're 50 that price is too high I
00:24:34.960 don't I don't have data to be honest
00:24:37.000 yeah okay this it you can do it if you
00:24:40.159 just if you have like 4 hours and some
00:24:42.080 coffee yeah so go to your churned
00:24:45.159 members and it'll click on their
00:24:47.159 membership and it will tell you their
00:24:48.320 LTV we calculate on a per member level
00:24:51.679 so just go and fill out your own
00:24:53.240 spreadsheet yeah um and you'll figure it
00:24:56.360 out like it's the numbers are there that
00:24:58.360 that's what I said you just have to use
00:24:59.600 some some
00:25:01.399 different methods yeah and for the like
00:25:03.919 General churn should I just export like
00:25:06.000 the list of all members and compare out
00:25:07.880 like week to week or something no no you
00:25:09.600 want to look at your churned members
00:25:11.399 will tell you their LTV so you want to
00:25:13.600 see all of your churn members and their
00:25:15.520 ltvs and then look at the average LTV
00:25:18.840 that's your LTV that from there you can
00:25:21.039 reverse engineer your churn because
00:25:24.399 LTV would be divided by your price that
00:25:27.200 gives you your you can do the math yeah
00:25:29.480 yeah yeah okay that ansers it yeah cool
00:25:31.880 awesome well this is great I know that
00:25:33.840 we yeah go for it so just going back to
00:25:35.919 on pricing too and what you're saying
00:25:37.080 with gym launch I I do believe I could
00:25:39.039 sell what I've built for 30k like I
00:25:41.240 believe I sell it for 30k whatever but I
00:25:43.399 also do have a painting business now
00:25:44.520 that's why is my main focus and I am
00:25:46.480 also willing to sell that same thing for
00:25:47.919 97 so just to go this is what my advice
00:25:50.480 to you uh would be because I understand
00:25:53.159 your business outside of this business I
00:25:55.399 think that I would try and I would want
00:25:57.720 it to be just high high enough of a
00:25:59.760 price that they care and so maybe make
00:26:01.960 it 5,000 a year maybe 10,000 but the
00:26:05.279 whole purpose is not to Makey I mean
00:26:06.880 sure you'll make money doing that but
00:26:08.480 the real money is that if you can get
00:26:10.000 those people to then open your version
00:26:12.480 of painting under your
00:26:14.399 logo and basically you can consolidate
00:26:17.520 and have them use your systems and
00:26:18.840 whatnot then it's like they kind of
00:26:20.279 basically become partners of yours as
00:26:21.960 they open up locations underneath of
00:26:23.440 your flag and if you have the capital
00:26:26.720 then you can front I'm sure the
00:26:27.799 capital's not too big for starting
00:26:29.279 painting stuff I would I mean do you
00:26:31.440 know I mean it's like 27 net right you
00:26:33.640 can afford it um so like I would be like
00:26:36.919 off front the capital you can get 20%
00:26:38.880 and I'll give you a base and then I'll
00:26:40.520 show you how to run the business or
00:26:41.679 whatever and like you're going to be a
00:26:42.919 co-owner like that's I think that might
00:26:44.919 be the mega play for you and then you
00:26:47.039 can still use that to have them have
00:26:48.360 skin in the game and you take that
00:26:50.279 community and skim from the top so it's
00:26:52.880 like you let the like you don't need to
00:26:55.080 take you don't need to bet on them you
00:26:57.200 let them you hold tryouts you know and
00:26:59.840 put the pull pull sticks in and just see
00:27:01.840 who kills each other and wins the leader
00:27:03.200 board and I'll bet you if your
00:27:04.559 leaderboard was about who is the who's
00:27:06.919 the next one who's going to be able to
00:27:07.760 partner with you bet your leaderboard
00:27:09.480 would go up take
00:27:14.080 not cool so you got what you need to do
00:27:17.880 have a question yeah you had that one
00:27:20.440 form that one equation conversion rate
00:27:22.640 times LTV was there like a equals to
00:27:26.120 it conversion rate
00:27:28.840 where yeah you wrote it on the I think
00:27:30.360 you flipped it over on the other page oh
00:27:32.279 traffic Trum bottom I don't believe that
00:27:35.520 that's where it was but I don't know if
00:27:37.360 you said the you finish the
00:27:39.279 equation oh for uh the these guys at the
00:27:42.799 top yeah I think we're just talking
00:27:44.080 about that cost PR so this is price
00:27:45.960 divided by turn equals LTV okay that's
00:27:48.279 what this that's what this is and then
00:27:50.279 traffic times conversion this is the
00:27:52.559 other two of this is then you've got
00:27:54.600 price as your levers and then you have
00:27:57.360 uh turn
00:27:59.799 so these are the four levers of the
00:28:01.360 business that we're talking
00:28:03.720 about so if you want to make more money
00:28:05.799 in your community you either have to
00:28:07.600 drive more traffic to it you have to
00:28:09.760 convert a higher percentage of that
00:28:11.120 traffic you have to price it as high as
00:28:13.159 you can and you and this is all balanced
00:28:15.840 with
00:28:17.880 churn which is okay well I I can raise
00:28:21.080 my price but does that also increase
00:28:22.840 churn and by how much and so that's why
00:28:24.960 we're find like it's balanced between
00:28:26.880 these two
00:28:28.840 and price also affects conversion so
00:28:31.440 there's a bidirectional relation between
00:28:32.799 churn price and conversion and then this
00:28:35.480 is this is the machine right this is
00:28:37.600 your business
00:28:39.120 machine right this is the machine that
00:28:41.320 we have at school this is what you drive
00:28:43.519 into it which is the traffic so this is
00:28:46.440 the effort that you guys are doing on a
00:28:47.559 regular basis it's the inputs into the
00:28:49.600 like this is the big black box of making
00:28:51.159 money this is school and then this is
00:28:53.039 what we're driving traffic whether it's
00:28:54.360 Facebook ads or whether that's content
00:28:55.880 or direct Outreach or whatever it is
00:28:58.559 this then just flows into the machine
00:29:00.919 you're looking for the maximum like
00:29:02.559 yield yeah so like how much dollars per
00:29:07.000 click any way right and all of these
00:29:09.799 variables play into that and you're
00:29:11.320 looking for like the most
00:29:13.120 efficient way to turn the click into
00:29:15.519 some money in yeah couldn't you just put
00:29:18.880 that in school like this metric you know
00:29:21.600 and just get that number so we see it
00:29:23.799 cuz you have all the stats
00:29:26.760 no which one
00:29:28.799 well I mean like yeah I can calculate
00:29:30.840 that it's like if we had that you know
00:29:33.039 if you go into the dashboard you can see
00:29:34.200 the Mr if we could see that right
00:29:35.760 underneath or maybe like you know the
00:29:37.240 churn so we can see it in real time cuz
00:29:39.240 it's easy to see increases in Mr but
00:29:41.279 like this takes more effort yeah that's
00:29:42.640 a good point like I you yeah the next
00:29:45.840 kind of metric we're rolling out is like
00:29:47.760 the traffic and conversion stats that
00:29:50.200 helps cuz now you can see your
00:29:51.519 conversion annual clicks right and I
00:29:53.880 already have that data and I've already
00:29:55.120 looked at it that's why I had some
00:29:57.240 insight and then we've already got the
00:29:59.799 churn data too so I guess yeah that
00:30:02.840 would be an interesting formula it would
00:30:04.600 be like
00:30:05.679 EPC earnings per click I think yeah that
00:30:09.159 could be a cool thing to
00:30:10.919 see and
00:30:14.320 then yeah good
00:30:17.519 idea in this next clip we talk about
00:30:19.919 beating your competition by doing things
00:30:22.120 differently than them and how to
00:30:24.039 identify a great market and other great
00:30:26.080 opportunities and how to approach them a
00:30:28.159 way that other people aren't seeing if
00:30:29.679 you're on school especially in like the
00:30:31.080 last couple of months you probably
00:30:32.159 noticed that there's a lot of really
00:30:33.240 good value there but it's it was getting
00:30:35.120 stuffy there wasn't a whole lot of
00:30:37.600 like personability right or fun so to
00:30:40.799 speak so it was an obvious Niche and um
00:30:45.279 it kind of happened organically where uh
00:30:48.279 the offer was solid funnel builder stuff
00:30:50.279 like this different business model
00:30:51.480 though instead of it being a high ticket
00:30:53.399 all up at front and then he would give
00:30:54.679 you the package and then [ __ ] off this
00:30:56.480 one was hey Will work with you and you
00:30:59.360 just give us a subscription so th000 Mr
00:31:02.919 and is it 999 what's the price 999 Okay
00:31:05.519 cool so that was the price and so we
00:31:08.120 started with what you guys were talking
00:31:10.000 about free and a high ticket so two
00:31:12.279 groups two groups yeah okay great yeah
00:31:14.320 this is yeah recurring theme but but it
00:31:16.679 keeps going and something else I think
00:31:18.519 so where was traffic coming from just
00:31:20.519 school okay we to this day we've never
00:31:22.720 made a single nothing not even social
00:31:24.880 Instagram my friends don't know that
00:31:26.639 this is going no one knows yeah you okay
00:31:29.799 got it so traffic was going to free
00:31:31.240 group right um yeah traffic was going to
00:31:33.399 free okay however school games front
00:31:35.840 page would bring people to paid so we
00:31:38.440 had a link there that said here's the
00:31:39.840 free
00:31:41.840 okay cuz that's where a lot of people
00:31:44.120 were coming so it's actually kind of
00:31:45.279 like this yeah yeah yeah anybody a
00:31:48.399 simpler one than this yeah I said I was
00:31:50.480 answer your question upell like 15
00:31:52.480 people eight bought within the first
00:31:53.960 hour okay and so everyone's like who the
00:31:56.840 hell is this guy and then from that it
00:31:58.880 sort of was a nice flywheel and the
00:32:01.120 pre-sale you did inside of the free
00:32:02.440 group uh yeah actually it was friends
00:32:05.120 family members basically anybody that
00:32:07.600 had something that we could offer was it
00:32:09.360 a zoom like do like a zoom no it was
00:32:11.679 like in person phone
00:32:13.720 calls people in the world we knew people
00:32:16.399 in the
00:32:17.279 world get in the floor get in the pment
00:32:19.720 okay so um that was what got it going
00:32:22.559 yeah but then from that point on um what
00:32:26.320 we were doing was sharing I Sam doesn't
00:32:28.360 like this phrase but you know we'll have
00:32:29.840 to come up with a different one A a
00:32:31.000 valuable post something that had it in
00:32:33.519 there I wouldn't call what you were
00:32:34.919 doing a value
00:32:36.760 post no this is really interesting
00:32:39.279 though because I think this industry's
00:32:41.440 gotten real weird with value posts you
00:32:43.799 know what I mean it's like people
00:32:45.960 posting value but no one cares yeah
00:32:48.760 because it's not even value it's just
00:32:50.200 some [ __ ] opinion or article and
00:32:52.240 like what Goose did differently is
00:32:56.360 he he
00:32:59.240 made things fun and got other people to
00:33:03.159 contribute on his post so his posts blew
00:33:05.600 up way more than value posts there was
00:33:07.840 like hundreds of comments and they were
00:33:10.559 really fun and like alive and so he
00:33:14.039 bought like personality fun in
00:33:18.360 like I would say personality in fun
00:33:21.320 posts and that those were like crushing
00:33:25.279 a lot of people engaged and then a lot
00:33:26.799 of people like who is the guy and they
00:33:28.159 viewed his profile then they saw his
00:33:29.799 stuff then he got on the leaderboards
00:33:31.559 now he's got another thing feeding him
00:33:34.440 and then he got on Discovery and now
00:33:36.080 there's another thing so by making
00:33:37.600 things fun and adding some personality
00:33:40.480 and being interesting and not just
00:33:42.559 trying to like post
00:33:46.039 articles you everyone kind of started to
00:33:48.639 know who he was and then that energy
00:33:51.360 started going there and then it started
00:33:53.039 looping on itself there was like a
00:33:54.600 feedback loop it was really interesting
00:33:56.760 to see that happen h
00:33:58.320 yeah and it'll probably start happening
00:34:00.120 more in the future the gift group is the
00:34:02.639 the next one so we're starting to see
00:34:04.200 this new pattern actually where funny
00:34:06.279 things are working really well this guy
00:34:09.000 made a group it's a pure joke yeah when
00:34:11.480 you get to level 9 you get kicked out
00:34:15.800 yeah it's it's really funny like see how
00:34:19.760 see what that does to everyone and SEL
00:34:21.839 and every all of these serious business
00:34:23.800 owners with seven figure businesses are
00:34:25.639 joining and just laughing yeah and
00:34:28.839 posting funny [ __ ] and like I love that
00:34:32.679 I think there's there's definitely
00:34:34.879 something that we a topic we could talk
00:34:36.760 about today about Community culture yeah
00:34:39.399 cuz I think that's how you get retention
00:34:42.280 and that's how you get raving fans as if
00:34:44.879 it's there's a culture and a vibe to it
00:34:48.399 um and that's starting to happen and
00:34:50.359 work honestly more effective than the
00:34:53.159 logic that I'm seeing really start to
00:34:56.000 take off it's quite interesting that's
00:34:58.200 probably how I Define a culture yeah
00:35:00.000 entertainment business in other words
00:35:01.839 too I think what goo is really great at
00:35:04.680 is making POS are really engaging like I
00:35:08.119 even like again plenty of seven figure
00:35:10.839 business owners I just like like to make
00:35:13.520 it f so that's like your thing that you
00:35:16.720 brought it's like not a value posst just
00:35:18.560 like a posst that drive engagement and
00:35:20.760 to make people like collaborate which is
00:35:22.839 huge yeah um there's a there's a a
00:35:26.400 theory that I have behind it that
00:35:28.040 actually is something that people can
00:35:29.640 probably start to use cuz it's kind of I
00:35:32.040 didn't realize it until I was looking in
00:35:33.440 retrospect but it's something that I
00:35:35.200 call um broccoli wrapped in bacon where
00:35:38.520 it looks really stupid and fun so you're
00:35:40.280 curious about it but by the time you're
00:35:41.920 done reading you actually learn
00:35:42.960 something so each one of my posts take
00:35:45.160 like 45 minutes to an hour to make cuz
00:35:47.960 sometimes I have the funny part or I
00:35:49.800 have the the broccoli part but I have to
00:35:52.880 come up with the other part and so what
00:35:56.359 we started to find in this system was
00:35:58.880 right after you got eyeballs and as long
00:36:00.720 as you had a good offer you immediately
00:36:04.319 could just start sharing all of your
00:36:06.240 successes everything that worked
00:36:07.560 everything that didn't work or even how
00:36:09.200 you felt that day if it was somehow
00:36:11.400 valuable but not a value post I suppose
00:36:14.000 and uh the the engagement went through
00:36:17.319 the roof and this is what it meant which
00:36:19.119 might help a lot of people that are here
00:36:21.319 is one of the reason we didn't go back
00:36:23.560 and start offering up ads is because at
00:36:26.599 least I was nervous a little bit about
00:36:28.160 the dilution of the quality of the
00:36:30.520 people cuz they were all coming from
00:36:31.839 school and those people knew how School
00:36:34.200 worked and were really [ __ ] engaged
00:36:36.880 and so we have I don't know 600 members
00:36:39.240 something like this but we're more
00:36:40.599 engaged than groups with 10,000 members
00:36:42.680 a lot of them and every time something
00:36:44.960 goes off like let's say it's someone
00:36:46.640 struggling with a I don't know a
00:36:49.280 heartbreak of some kind a bunch of
00:36:51.160 community members just swarm on this
00:36:52.880 dude and help him out and it was that
00:36:56.400 culture as Sam was talking about that we
00:36:59.240 somehow stumbled into and realized oh
00:37:01.280 okay this is this massive thing it's not
00:37:03.359 just like kind of a niche it's totally a
00:37:05.359 niche um addressing sort of the
00:37:07.240 personability the things that you might
00:37:09.119 need from a friend and then that was why
00:37:12.640 people were signing up for everything
00:37:13.960 else they just wanted to be able to do
00:37:15.480 that and run their business in like a
00:37:17.520 safe space so um there's something to be
00:37:21.240 said I suppose about being able to uh
00:37:26.640 reach out to the things that don't
00:37:28.079 logically make sense and that was what
00:37:30.040 we ended up doing there so as you said
00:37:32.720 in conclusion the discovery ended up
00:37:35.160 being uh that backbone where uh probably
00:37:38.800 a lot of us should maybe lean on a
00:37:40.440 little bit more if you can if you can
00:37:42.560 get that slightly higher the number of
00:37:45.280 people that are coming into school all
00:37:46.480 the time is just rising and everyone's
00:37:48.599 looking like if you've got one offer
00:37:50.200 here you've got another one over there
00:37:51.960 that you can just jump over the same
00:37:53.200 person it's just a bunch of really high
00:37:55.720 quality leads and people that are
00:37:57.720 waiting to to jump onto
00:38:00.480 those I may not have much for you to
00:38:02.640 chew on there I just no that was fine
00:38:04.839 much to share it's the first one we've
00:38:06.560 seen that didn't really use external
00:38:09.520 yeah yeah
00:38:11.960 um mean I know Evin I mean she obviously
00:38:14.400 did Drive outside traffic but she
00:38:15.680 crushes internally as well because she
00:38:18.000 she has truly valuable posts um and a
00:38:20.440 lot of her posts like the differen is so
00:38:22.640 for everybody at home uh I feel like the
00:38:25.079 difference between the value post and
00:38:27.720 the quote value post and valuable post
00:38:30.319 is that the quote value posts are like
00:38:34.240 here are six things to no one gives a
00:38:36.160 [ __ ] right um the value bull posts are
00:38:40.440 like I did work for you or I took risk
00:38:44.040 for you or I spent money for you that
00:38:46.040 you don't have to spend and so fundament
00:38:48.240 it's a bargain on time or money and so
00:38:50.319 like Evelyn's like hey I spent $25,000
00:38:52.680 on ads and these are the ads that I ran
00:38:54.880 and this is what happened and people
00:38:55.920 were like oh [ __ ] well great I don't
00:38:57.920 have to do that and this worked for her
00:38:59.520 like she gives her tldr at the end and
00:39:01.280 you're like that was valuable yes if you
00:39:04.160 can blend if you can get a blend of that
00:39:06.200 and then people making like a parody
00:39:08.119 video about the community like have you
00:39:09.760 seen the ones people have made for
00:39:11.599 school if you can get a good balance of
00:39:14.119 that that I would say is like Perfection
00:39:16.240 cuz you've got the value but you're also
00:39:17.880 smiling and feel like a part of this
00:39:20.880 group and then you they're like I can't
00:39:23.280 believe I'm having fun and I'm talking
00:39:25.079 to people that make millions of dollars
00:39:27.160 if you get those two it's like it's
00:39:30.319 experience and results so on this on the
00:39:32.319 customer success side like in normal B2B
00:39:34.720 businesses we talk about both it's like
00:39:36.520 you can get someone results and there's
00:39:38.880 also client experience which are just
00:39:40.400 like the soft and the hard and believe
00:39:43.040 it or not like client experience matters
00:39:44.800 sometimes a lot more than even the
00:39:46.160 results does um like if you have amazing
00:39:48.760 results and a terrible experience the
00:39:50.319 moment they can find somebody else who
00:39:51.720 can get get them the result they will
00:39:53.160 leave but if you have an amazing
00:39:55.079 experience and like mediocre results
00:39:56.599 they're like well I love these guys and
00:39:59.160 they'll stay yeah so one of the the the
00:40:01.920 tweaks that we ended up kind of noticing
00:40:03.720 is that we on school is so great cuz
00:40:06.200 Community we actually don't really have
00:40:08.680 the post as a thing or what we do we
00:40:10.920 really turn it back into them so the
00:40:13.359 community is the community and we really
00:40:15.480 highlight that versus being like the
00:40:16.880 overlord being like here's what we give
00:40:18.520 you guys it's like no more and more in
00:40:21.160 the comments comments DM like that was
00:40:24.240 the thing that really just gets super
00:40:26.079 fan do you guys think I'm you guys GA
00:40:28.280 engage a lot in your own Community right
00:40:30.319 and I think that's like most people
00:40:32.880 could do it like in terms of the people
00:40:34.359 at home are like my my community is dead
00:40:36.280 and it's cuz you're expecting like the
00:40:37.680 community to do the work and in the
00:40:39.200 beginning like you need to drum it up
00:40:41.319 like you need to engage you need to be
00:40:42.599 thoughtful about your responses to
00:40:44.240 comments and things like that they are
00:40:46.200 small things they're really nuanced um I
00:40:48.760 mean School understands it really well
00:40:50.319 because it it use the platform but like
00:40:52.240 if you're making a post and you're not
00:40:53.880 using a poll you're [ __ ] up there
00:40:56.760 there's something that you can do that
00:40:58.200 just adds a little bit of flavor to what
00:40:59.560 you're doing um there's also like we
00:41:03.040 were talking about earlier pinning to
00:41:04.640 module like every little thing that
00:41:07.240 school has if you if you're not using it
00:41:09.760 you're kind of leaving money on the
00:41:10.880 table because there's usually a lot of
00:41:12.880 thought that's gone on behind the scenes
00:41:14.560 for that thing and I'd even go as far as
00:41:16.359 saying that you know we have this freet
00:41:17.560 to- paid system but probably what's
00:41:18.880 going to start emerging a lot more here
00:41:20.760 is what we did where there was a lot of
00:41:23.400 drop off where people wanted to hire us
00:41:26.079 from the free but they didn't have a
00:41:27.839 grand ready to go or they didn't have
00:41:29.440 their offer ready to shoot so they would
00:41:31.760 fall to a low ticket which is just like
00:41:33.960 a white label GSL ghl but we ended up
00:41:38.000 inverting it because people were like
00:41:39.480 what the hell does this software do and
00:41:41.160 you had to go and explain the whole damn
00:41:42.599 thing instead we just sold the
00:41:44.240 Mastermind uh later on and then gave
00:41:46.599 them this as a gift like hey and you
00:41:48.520 also have the software and then it just
00:41:50.200 went through the roof where people just
00:41:51.359 kept signing up so inevitably we had
00:41:53.359 free low ticket High ticket and it's
00:41:56.160 just been wonderful having that and it's
00:41:58.359 just this flywheel where people Bounce
00:41:59.720 Around within it and they of course that
00:42:01.880 gift of the software that gives them the
00:42:04.040 incentive to go up because they like I
00:42:05.480 want you to just do this for me now I
00:42:07.119 know it's here
00:42:09.160 so so I guess they've got the extra
00:42:11.520 piece on the end of that simple funnel
00:42:13.319 they've got
00:42:15.079 free low ticket and high ticket which it
00:42:19.359 sounds like that's what everyone
00:42:20.480 eventually wants to achieve from what
00:42:21.839 we've heard at all of these events but
00:42:23.839 just balancing the the traffic Source
00:42:26.000 the free and the paid first is probably
00:42:28.160 everyone's first step in this fourth
00:42:29.680 clip we talk about something that I made
00:42:31.079 tons of mistakes on early either you've
00:42:33.040 got entrepreneurs who are really good at
00:42:34.200 retaining customers and don't know how
00:42:35.280 to get them or they're really good at
00:42:36.520 marketing and sales and don't know how
00:42:37.640 to keep them if you're one of those
00:42:39.440 people who's really good at Marketing
00:42:40.520 sales and doesn't know how to keep them
00:42:42.240 this is all about making sure that they
00:42:44.000 stay with you and I'll tell you now as
00:42:45.640 an investor the number one thing that I
00:42:47.319 look at in business is how many people
00:42:49.200 from last year are still paying you it
00:42:50.599 gets way easier to grow when you don't
00:42:52.240 lose 100% of your customers every year
00:42:54.079 that's a promise if we want to talk
00:42:55.559 about engagement we did it I just spent
00:42:58.280 weeks analyzing this and I what I found
00:43:00.920 was honestly
00:43:03.319 shocking like that's a hook yeah video
00:43:07.520 ends so what's really interesting is
00:43:12.040 classroom content doesn't really
00:43:15.319 matter um first of all you do not need
00:43:18.280 to make a monster course in fact that
00:43:20.200 just overwhelms everyone right we have
00:43:22.839 an hour hours is less than an hour right
00:43:25.280 yeah anime shreds launch with no class
00:43:28.760 um and no post more than one
00:43:33.359 sentence some posts were just like six
00:43:36.480 emojis and they had thousands of
00:43:38.800 comments um
00:43:41.760 so it's the things that really work I've
00:43:45.280 seen in and that are very low E low
00:43:48.960 effort too
00:43:51.319 is you you get your community to share
00:43:55.119 something about themselves right so the
00:43:58.119 it the CU I've seen these posts that
00:44:00.240 always rip really well like they get
00:44:03.160 they get more comments than like a
00:44:05.079 wellth thought out article post by the
00:44:07.559 Creator who pinned it so that's like you
00:44:10.520 know
00:44:12.079 um one that always works is like what's
00:44:15.040 your favorite book have you ever seen
00:44:16.839 that one just keep popping up in your
00:44:18.359 communities even if some random asks it
00:44:20.920 it just keeps getting comments and it
00:44:22.520 have you seen this that one because it's
00:44:25.079 just asking members to share something
00:44:26.520 about themselves
00:44:27.760 and then other people are curious what's
00:44:29.839 your favorite movie if you want even the
00:44:32.400 most simple one what's your favorite
00:44:35.079 GIF that one that one's popular that one
00:44:38.000 just guaranteed like more comments than
00:44:41.160 anything else and it's kind of a little
00:44:43.839 bit more fun it's not too much effort to
00:44:45.800 think about um
00:44:49.240 or this one I found is really good it's
00:44:54.359 like um sheer
00:44:57.160 three things you do share something you
00:44:59.760 do for fun where you're from and a photo
00:45:03.480 of your
00:45:04.720 workspace right cuz people want to share
00:45:07.319 and so they're like okay I'll take a
00:45:08.559 photo of my desk and workspace I'm from
00:45:11.640 Germany and I like to play golf right
00:45:15.400 that's just sharing themsel and they do
00:45:17.720 a comment or a post like that and then
00:45:19.599 everyone looks at the image and they
00:45:21.280 notice other things they're like oh
00:45:23.079 you've got this desk or oh you're into
00:45:25.040 guitar I also play guitar and now
00:45:26.480 they're making friends you're connecting
00:45:27.960 the community together like we actually
00:45:30.599 do use that one on the course and we
00:45:32.400 tell people if you see someone's
00:45:33.880 introduction post with that comment a
00:45:35.720 gift as well and it works
00:45:37.760 amazingly and it's like the culture of
00:45:39.680 the gift that they post let's say they
00:45:40.680 put a wolf for Wall Street you like gift
00:45:42.079 on their post now everyone will start
00:45:43.720 putting them in yeah and so these This I
00:45:47.720 Swear is the key to like cuz when
00:45:49.920 someone comes in they all you just need
00:45:51.960 a simple way for them to engage and once
00:45:54.280 they're engaged and if they meet someone
00:45:56.200 they like if now they meet someone they
00:45:58.119 on DMS and then that moves to like a
00:46:01.480 hangout in real life or on Zoom they
00:46:04.240 associate that value back to your group
00:46:07.400 right can I just add something as well
00:46:09.119 hen can I just add something yeah go for
00:46:10.720 it yeah so if you want people to engage
00:46:13.520 you can do like all these like little
00:46:14.800 tricks or you can just tell them to
00:46:16.119 engage as well so like what we've done
00:46:17.960 is we've just like indoctrinated people
00:46:20.200 to engage with each other essentially
00:46:21.599 right like in a good way though so we
00:46:23.040 talked about the pr The Mastermind
00:46:24.440 Principle from thinking Grow Rich we
00:46:25.839 explained it to people and said this is
00:46:27.640 why you should engage with each other
00:46:29.280 and then now everyone's just hosting
00:46:30.520 calls with each other communicating like
00:46:32.720 that kind of thing so sometimes you just
00:46:33.920 need to tell people it's the same with
00:46:35.359 the Q&A recordings as well just tell
00:46:38.200 people to watch them give them a reason
00:46:39.839 like tell a story that makes them want
00:46:41.800 to watch it and then they'll watch it so
00:46:43.520 it just works with anything it's just
00:46:44.839 sometimes you just have to tell them why
00:46:46.640 they should do it yeah this is huge like
00:46:48.800 especially on the Q&A calls people
00:46:50.760 sometimes have a question like does
00:46:52.119 anybody here no blah blah blah and if
00:46:53.880 there's like 30 people and there's 600
00:46:55.480 in the community we like well have you
00:46:57.119 made a post and always no so we like
00:46:59.319 make a post we'll pin it maybe if it's
00:47:01.119 good one and like just telling people
00:47:03.440 that they can make a post they almost
00:47:05.000 feel like they don't have the permission
00:47:06.319 when they join the community but like no
00:47:07.920 you can make a post you can ask if
00:47:09.400 somebody here knows this or does that
00:47:12.200 and just you know doing that especially
00:47:13.520 if something more advanced that you
00:47:14.880 can't really answer in 5 minutes I think
00:47:16.960 that's huge yeah
00:47:19.440 that's that's good for like the regular
00:47:21.839 conversation I think you need to imagine
00:47:23.319 a blend of like sometimes you need to
00:47:25.200 share like something you did like you
00:47:28.520 need to always pay attention to problems
00:47:30.440 your community has and you as the lady
00:47:32.880 it's your job to like find the best
00:47:35.400 solution and you can kind of crowdsource
00:47:37.720 it but sometimes you have to go and
00:47:39.119 explore your on your own and then you
00:47:41.440 find it and you bring it back and you
00:47:43.040 share it you're like hey we found we
00:47:45.200 know this is a problem we did this we
00:47:47.680 found the solution and here it is that
00:47:50.359 that's like good
00:47:51.880 leadership then you need but you need
00:47:54.079 some fun stuff in there for sure I'm
00:47:56.359 honestly shocked at how much of a
00:47:57.880 difference it makes if you have it it I
00:48:00.240 honestly would go as far as saying it's
00:48:01.680 more important than the value like cuz
00:48:03.839 I've seen s figure people join groups
00:48:06.839 that are purely for
00:48:08.480 entertainment um but with other seven
00:48:11.440 figure people so it's like the value
00:48:13.280 happens as an accident
00:48:16.559 um and members contributing like I think
00:48:20.000 one of the most common problems I've
00:48:21.359 seen is people say I've got members in
00:48:24.280 my community I'm posting five times a
00:48:27.160 day but no one's
00:48:29.760 commenting right that have you seen
00:48:32.119 people say
00:48:33.319 that yeah and it's because the people
00:48:36.440 that have engaged communities aren't
00:48:37.800 posting five times a day their members
00:48:39.359 are commenting it's a difference and
00:48:41.760 when you write an article this long
00:48:43.640 that's just an opinion piece what is
00:48:46.119 someone supposed to
00:48:48.520 say like really like and you're putting
00:48:51.440 a burden on them to read that [ __ ]
00:48:53.559 thing like who wants to read that
00:48:56.160 another follow you can do to get more
00:48:57.760 engagement too is uh I like to never
00:49:00.240 answer anything in the comments I always
00:49:01.880 ask questions so everything gets
00:49:03.839 answered with a question which follows a
00:49:05.599 red for every person um and and and you
00:49:09.119 get the research you get to find out
00:49:10.559 those problems you can yeah asking a
00:49:12.240 question it's just that always works so
00:49:15.079 well it's crazy yeah I think um a really
00:49:18.640 good idea too is if you have something
00:49:20.960 that's like a community review like for
00:49:23.240 example we have music money and a lot of
00:49:24.720 we tell a lot of the artists to post
00:49:26.400 their new music post their new beats and
00:49:28.640 then the community members will review
00:49:30.240 be like oh I think you should tweak this
00:49:31.480 I think you should tweak that and then
00:49:32.599 we have another Community where it's
00:49:33.760 mainly about like content making good
00:49:35.480 content and people will post their
00:49:37.520 content or post a link to their content
00:49:39.200 it's almost like I don't know if you
00:49:40.640 guys remember like the engagement groups
00:49:42.480 like back in the day where like they'll
00:49:43.720 post it and everybody goes and comments
00:49:45.280 and likes on their post on Instagram and
00:49:47.559 that increases a lot more engagement
00:49:48.760 around the community too absolutely yeah
00:49:50.599 and just one more thing to add on to
00:49:51.799 that like I think people underestimate
00:49:53.319 like how well information travels in the
00:49:55.720 form of a meme right like a meme can
00:49:58.040 communicate like a 45 minute video worth
00:50:00.920 of information to the right person right
00:50:03.160 if they're a sponge and can soak the
00:50:04.720 information out of it and so I just
00:50:06.359 think like whenever I see like the
00:50:07.680 videos Ryan post right or like something
00:50:09.559 like that I'm like oh that's funny did
00:50:11.480 you see the Fast and Furious I was dying
00:50:13.480 bro I watched that like 400 times yeah
00:50:16.559 and so like I I think people just
00:50:18.200 underestimate like all right like you
00:50:20.000 know like what Goose does is like you
00:50:21.400 know he makes it fun to read a post I
00:50:23.000 think a meme just like sucks your eye in
00:50:25.319 and so it's like if you can figure out
00:50:26.280 how to Comm unicate something through a
00:50:28.359 meme then you're killing it you know
00:50:31.079 yeah I just watched this movie last
00:50:32.480 night it's really good dumb money anyone
00:50:35.160 seen
00:50:35.960 it it's about the gme GameStop vers the
00:50:39.880 hedge funds and it's it's a W Street
00:50:43.000 bets for they have a they had a very
00:50:46.119 good culture you know they invented
00:50:47.839 Diamond hands and like they were making
00:50:50.680 memes of like the Wall Street bets head
00:50:53.079 spanking the hedge funds like you know
00:50:55.760 and everyone just felt like they were in
00:50:57.640 this David verse Goliath like thing and
00:51:00.760 they were all part of something and
00:51:03.920 that's the most powerful thing you can
00:51:05.599 get is when you get that culture there I
00:51:07.720 think school community in the last month
00:51:09.720 has finally found something there's like
00:51:12.680 this culture cuz people are contributing
00:51:14.839 these parody videos that must have taken
00:51:17.400 them a long time if you've seen the
00:51:18.480 Harry Potter one I made the I made the
00:51:20.599 friends one took me like 4 hours the
00:51:23.640 Harry Potter one must have taken a dude
00:51:25.480 that was intensive
00:51:27.400 you've seen the Harry Potter one right
00:51:29.440 yeah yeah
00:51:31.200 um I seen them all them wisely too but
00:51:34.839 the power like referencing that dumb
00:51:36.920 bunny thing that guy just tweeted out a
00:51:38.440 picture just the other day of a gam of a
00:51:40.880 dude leaning up to play games and
00:51:42.319 GameStop uh GameStop stock shot up again
00:51:45.480 from dude just tweeting a picture right
00:51:47.480 just to like no no words attach nothing
00:51:49.720 people are like oh it's back on I need
00:51:51.160 to you know buy into this GameStop and
00:51:52.720 so that's what the power of mean guy
00:51:55.079 posted that yeah yeah he just did got to
00:51:56.960 watch this movie write it down Dum money
00:51:58.760 not only is it an amazing movie Just for
00:52:00.400 straight entertainment but this guy who
00:52:02.720 led that GameStop thing is probably one
00:52:04.520 of the best community leaders we've ever
00:52:06.880 seen on the internet cuz he bought down
00:52:09.400 some hedge
00:52:13.240 funds and up with with memes nothing but
00:52:17.240 memes and he wasn't he wasn't promising
00:52:19.440 the world to people either at first he
00:52:20.799 wasn't telling people GameStop was going
00:52:22.079 to go up 100x he was saying this is
00:52:23.559 going to go up 4 or 5x and I feel like
00:52:25.559 that's another thing people can do is
00:52:26.799 not overpromise whenever and then people
00:52:28.920 are like yes I believe it can do what
00:52:31.200 you're saying it's going to do and then
00:52:32.680 everybody believes in it and then you
00:52:34.480 know yeah yeah that that is perfect
00:52:38.000 exactly what happened in that movie and
00:52:40.000 that's what we're starting to see happen
00:52:41.640 in school like people are making these
00:52:43.599 parody videos and then people laugh and
00:52:48.160 then we started seeing people posting
00:52:49.920 like this is the most positive place
00:52:53.440 I've ever seen on the internet like that
00:52:56.680 pretty powerful so people want to go
00:52:59.200 where the energy good right like if you
00:53:01.559 scroll your Instagram and you feel bad
00:53:03.559 and you go to Facebook bad twitter World
00:53:06.200 War something then you go like you know
00:53:09.680 you go to school and there's some funny
00:53:11.520 videos and someone making a million
00:53:13.880 dollars that is the ultimate right like
00:53:17.200 people winning and people laughing yeah
00:53:21.680 we've seen two outstanding ways that you
00:53:23.599 can drive culture especially if you're
00:53:25.520 like trying to Pivot one of them
00:53:27.000 categories it's super passive this like
00:53:29.799 the thing that's right above your feed
00:53:32.440 where you can sort of when someone comes
00:53:33.880 in they get a pretty good idea this is
00:53:36.040 actually Sam's idea um they get a good
00:53:38.280 idea of what the place is for so even if
00:53:40.559 you don't actively use them it's just
00:53:42.200 kind of a good foundation we've got a
00:53:43.559 lot of good feedback back from that even
00:53:45.040 though I hated them at first they're
00:53:46.599 super useful in like a level one sort of
00:53:48.920 way and this then the more important one
00:53:51.720 is your PIN post does anyone rotate
00:53:53.880 their post actually I learned this [ __ ]
00:53:55.880 from you did you all right that was the
00:53:57.880 first thing I ever saw who's this dude
00:54:00.119 long hair clicked your post and he's
00:54:02.400 like rotate two pin posts a day I I do
00:54:05.680 that myself and I do that with uh with
00:54:08.119 Justin as well rotating pin post it's
00:54:11.000 overpowered actually and so you how long
00:54:12.920 until you saw results immediately
00:54:15.720 immediately yeah you rotate pen post and
00:54:18.000 and you my my favorite thing is when you
00:54:19.920 see people typing like way everyone's
00:54:22.799 like oh what are they typing about yeah
00:54:24.599 so what we what we did with them is ex L
00:54:26.799 this uh the pin post when you first
00:54:28.960 start a community your first uh thought
00:54:31.760 is oh I need to start here so that
00:54:34.359 everyone knew knows exactly where to go
00:54:36.640 which actually kind of [ __ ] you after a
00:54:37.880 little while because the people that are
00:54:39.880 coming back seem the see the same [ __ ]
00:54:41.760 every single time they come back and so
00:54:44.119 you kind of want to speak to them more
00:54:46.480 so you post the pin of the start here
00:54:48.799 Post in a classroom module or you know
00:54:51.200 whatever you need in the start here
00:54:53.119 classroom and then the pin posts are
00:54:55.319 just the stuff that's going on day to
00:54:56.799 day you got a crazy idea or if you can't
00:54:59.160 post that day you take one of your
00:55:00.680 community members and you post them up
00:55:02.040 there and they're [ __ ] jazzed to we
00:55:04.079 pinned oh yeah that once if you pin your
00:55:07.119 members stuff that's key I think you
00:55:09.680 should always aim to have at least one
00:55:11.520 or two the ultimate is all of the pin
00:55:13.720 post from other people that aren't you
00:55:16.160 it just shows the community that if they
00:55:19.440 they it is possible for them to make
00:55:21.160 something that you're willing to pin at
00:55:23.559 the top and then it it's it's like
00:55:26.599 creating this incentive for people to do
00:55:29.559 that um the other thing I would say is
00:55:32.359 you should always be just sensing and on
00:55:34.720 the lookout for who the most valuable
00:55:39.119 contributors are in your group or in
00:55:41.400 your community so
00:55:43.039 like you know when Goose when Goose kind
00:55:46.839 of started to take off I sent mm and I
00:55:51.160 said now that you've proven yourself
00:55:52.960 School
00:55:54.160 hardcore like what do you think of this
00:55:56.839 upcoming feature right so I started to
00:55:59.240 bring him in and give him like access
00:56:02.079 way more access to me and and then you
00:56:06.359 know he's been at the office all week
00:56:08.640 helping design screens for the next 3
00:56:11.160 months that's s so I mean Ted Carr who's
00:56:15.359 hosting a school meet up right now in LA
00:56:17.280 with 100 people um he is a key to our
00:56:22.160 office so he can just and the alarm pin
00:56:25.280 code he can just up whenever he wants
00:56:27.640 and we just talk about sensitive things
00:56:29.680 in front of him it's like he's a member
00:56:31.280 of our team but what I'm trying to say
00:56:33.640 here is when you see those people you
00:56:36.520 need to reward them because all a group
00:56:41.000 needs to keep it engaged even when it's
00:56:43.200 big as 10 true regulars people like it's
00:56:47.200 like a sitcom right like how many people
00:56:49.839 watch friends but it's just like five
00:56:52.319 people right but it's those people that
00:56:55.240 get everyone else to to come cuz they
00:56:56.920 like the vibe and they like it so you
00:57:00.599 know we've got people like Ted we've got
00:57:02.559 people like Goose um there's Max P
00:57:06.359 there's Evelyn right all of them
00:57:08.480 contribute a different piece this Ryan
00:57:10.599 guy with GIF is adding a new kind of
00:57:12.880 flavor Kirby was adding something now
00:57:15.440 he's on the team Matthew was adding
00:57:16.920 something now he's in charge of our
00:57:18.839 podcast and so and there's a lot more
00:57:21.400 people but you've got to find those when
00:57:25.000 you do see those people you need to like
00:57:28.240 do something to make them feel like
00:57:30.599 they've they're a part of the leadership
00:57:33.440 in a way of of the community what I did
00:57:36.599 is I hired one of the best guys to do a
00:57:39.160 weekly call so I just pay him 100 bucks
00:57:41.240 and he does one of the weekly calls so
00:57:43.000 he's like a professional software
00:57:44.640 engineer and he just helps with like the
00:57:46.720 technical questions so he was already
00:57:48.559 posting a bunch but I asked him hey do
00:57:50.400 you want this because he already was
00:57:51.799 attending every single call so might as
00:57:53.480 well get you know 100 bucks for it and
00:57:55.000 literally for 400 $ a month I get like a
00:57:58.240 professional software developer that
00:57:59.680 just hosts a weekly call in my community
00:58:02.559 yeah this is how you find your team by
00:58:04.000 the way like honestly everyone we've
00:58:06.520 hired that's on the nons software
00:58:08.440 engineering side is from school users
00:58:12.280 like when someone applies I look I'm
00:58:13.960 like where's their link and I look at
00:58:15.119 their activity chart and I'm like this
00:58:16.440 person doesn't use skill like why if
00:58:19.280 they don't care about school I don't
00:58:20.400 want to hire them so like if someone
00:58:23.680 literally cares about your community and
00:58:25.640 is contrib without getting paid then
00:58:28.480 they're going to obviously believe in
00:58:30.160 what you're doing right well this is
00:58:31.839 changing topics from um engagement which
00:58:34.760 I don't know if we should do yet but
00:58:36.559 that is how you find great people yeah I
00:58:38.599 want to hit on one thing with engagement
00:58:40.160 so we we've tossed around the word
00:58:41.880 culture and we haven't defined the word
00:58:44.039 culture and so I'll just share mine that
00:58:46.319 might be helpful which is the rules that
00:58:48.559 govern reward and Punishment in
00:58:50.200 organization and so if you think like we
00:58:52.520 have either spoken rules or unspoken
00:58:54.039 rules but there are rules of how you act
00:58:55.839 and so if you're with your buddies if
00:58:57.559 you say hey I got my girlfriend flowers
00:58:59.280 they just might all of a sudden say like
00:59:00.880 oh you like sucking dick too you know
00:59:02.160 like you're like okay that's the rule
00:59:03.480 that's a rule of behavior right like if
00:59:05.160 you do something that's nice for your
00:59:07.319 wife or girlfriend you're going to get
00:59:08.520 made fun of um but it's because they
00:59:10.520 like you right and but like if you said
00:59:12.400 that to your parents or your you know
00:59:14.480 whatever at the dinner table they would
00:59:16.160 be like oh that's really sweet or that's
00:59:17.240 really nice of you right and so it's
00:59:19.319 different rules so there's a different
00:59:20.720 culture at the family dinner table than
00:59:22.319 there is when you're out with your
00:59:23.760 buddies and so fundamentally trying to
00:59:27.000 what are the rules that govern what gets
00:59:30.119 rewarded and what gets punished within
00:59:31.839 my community will dictate what the quote
00:59:33.960 culture is within it and so just kind of
00:59:36.359 thinking about that in terms of those
00:59:37.640 terms will probably make it a lot easier
00:59:39.559 and so to your point G I actually think
00:59:41.480 this is uh the category piece that
00:59:43.079 you're saying really really important
00:59:45.240 and the main reason I say that is cu
00:59:46.680 like if people are about to make a post
00:59:48.599 when you see what the categories are
00:59:51.160 this signals or this tells them this is
00:59:53.599 what we want you to post about and so
00:59:56.240 this is like this is an an innate rule
00:59:57.799 to this community like we want you to
00:59:59.280 post about winds we want you to post
01:00:00.599 about traffic we want you post about mon
01:00:01.960 monetization we want you post about
01:00:03.119 whatever so it might be like you might
01:00:04.839 have like gifts like they'll imagine the
01:00:07.280 community like same identical Community
01:00:09.640 uh internet marketing right just
01:00:10.799 something like completely generic and
01:00:12.760 the categories in one are gifts
01:00:16.160 memes right like something that makes
01:00:18.760 money or like money- making uh wins and
01:00:22.319 uh Just for kicks right and so like that
01:00:25.000 is one community the other one is um
01:00:27.599 conversion rate value post uh question
01:00:31.640 whatever right and so when you see the
01:00:33.640 two of those like you have a very
01:00:35.079 different feel for those communities
01:00:38.000 before you even engage and so like right
01:00:39.559 off the bat that's the that's the banner
01:00:41.960 literally the the subcategory of all the
01:00:44.799 topics that are going to get discussed
01:00:46.039 and so like if you want to shift the
01:00:47.599 conversation that's going to happen
01:00:48.880 within the culture of or within the
01:00:51.280 within the community that you have
01:00:52.880 telling them what you want them to talk
01:00:54.280 about with the categories feels like one
01:00:55.559 of the most most important things that
01:00:57.280 you can do to do that and you also by by
01:01:00.200 very nature of having those topics means
01:01:01.640 these are what we
01:01:03.039 reward yeah and what we actually did is
01:01:05.400 um we like gamified the categories as
01:01:07.280 well so when it's like um I think Sam
01:01:09.760 did it with like son.com is he made
01:01:11.400 people like ring the bell so we got like
01:01:13.280 a clip from a game like a GTA 5 where
01:01:15.680 Trevor says show me the money and every
01:01:17.920 time someone gets a win they post that
01:01:19.440 but rather than calling it a wins
01:01:20.599 category put haha show me the money and
01:01:22.799 every time they got win they' post it
01:01:24.440 and it would just make it way more
01:01:25.559 respons if everyone would come show me
01:01:27.319 the money every time someone gets a win
01:01:29.160 and it just goes insane yeah and you can
01:01:30.920 have it be wins or you can have it
01:01:32.000 something be funny the way you have it
01:01:33.240 it's still ACC same thing but one of
01:01:34.559 them's like I'm I'm more inclined to
01:01:36.839 post this if I don't feel like I'm
01:01:38.359 flexing you know what I mean um so yeah
01:01:41.160 I I think this was like a I like would
01:01:42.880 double star that personally and then I
01:01:45.000 think that the pinning your members
01:01:47.599 feels very important like think about
01:01:49.480 like what's that's like a jackpot reward
01:01:51.359 like this is what we reward in general
01:01:53.520 and if you pin pin certain posts then
01:01:55.920 that's a super reward this is like let
01:01:57.720 me let me put this guy on the on lit a
01:01:59.839 literal pedestal and tell everyone in my
01:02:01.359 community this is what I want you to do
01:02:03.039 this is me doing a big reward for
01:02:05.160 somebody who does this and so it orients
01:02:07.839 the behavior of everyone in the
01:02:09.119 community and then I'd say what I do is
01:02:11.599 like pinning is probably the first or
01:02:13.960 saying this is a great post or this is
01:02:15.880 amazing right that's key like you see me
01:02:18.319 do this I do it all the time tell people
01:02:21.520 then pinning them but also sending them
01:02:24.079 a DM and then the only people I DM are
01:02:27.240 the people that are like the most School
01:02:29.559 hardcore basically and that I talk to
01:02:32.960 them all the time and then the next
01:02:34.359 level of Hardcore is every now and then
01:02:36.079 will be on zoom and then the next level
01:02:39.039 is they'll be at the office right it's
01:02:41.559 literally what I do not by Design or
01:02:44.319 deliberately this is just how it
01:02:45.960 happened but bring those people closer
01:02:48.599 and give them more cuz by the way they
01:02:51.799 also give me the best feedback that
01:02:55.960 they're helping design Skool literally
01:02:59.000 um and you can use them to help you
01:03:02.119 shape the future of this of the thing
01:03:04.520 you're building and when the commun when
01:03:06.960 a new member comes in and they see that
01:03:08.920 you're really tight with members like
01:03:11.440 that they're going to be like oh [ __ ] if
01:03:13.599 I can get my way up there I can have
01:03:16.400 that too do you get what I'm saying if
01:03:19.960 you if you do this it'll work it'll work
01:03:23.039 really well and it's not exhausting at
01:03:25.440 all is the least exhausting business
01:03:27.400 I've ever run because I don't have to
01:03:30.000 talk to any like everyone there's no I'm
01:03:32.880 never promising that I only talk to the
01:03:35.599 people who I
01:03:37.279 think who I want to talk to really yeah
01:03:41.680 was a point a few days ago the school
01:03:43.640 games Community was really dead no one
01:03:45.760 was posting I like [ __ ] I'm going to get
01:03:47.440 fired all I did was I added a category
01:03:50.160 called banter and I messaged Ryan who's
01:03:52.480 the gift guy who's top of the school
01:03:54.119 community and I said made this for you
01:03:56.079 and immediately he made a post there was
01:03:57.680 300 comments in like 2 hours from one
01:04:00.240 post and also on the reward punishment
01:04:02.680 thing whenever Evelyn posts every single
01:04:05.680 time she posts I'll comment Evelyn overd
01:04:07.599 delivers again just to like reinforce
01:04:09.480 the good behavior and the DMs I probably
01:04:11.599 send 10 a day if there's ever a good
01:04:13.279 comment I DM and I'm like this was a
01:04:15.160 great comment that was a great post and
01:04:17.240 then bad behavior if someone post bad
01:04:19.039 stuff don't like it message them and say
01:04:22.400 here's our rules here's what a bad post
01:04:23.839 looks like reward good here's what a bad
01:04:26.799 post look like your
01:04:31.160 post see
01:04:34.599 screenshot I got a quick uh a quick
01:04:36.640 tactic that's been like working wonders
01:04:38.279 for our culture true um I have all my
01:04:40.160 guys when they join put like in their
01:04:41.680 bio in school I put like a 15-minute
01:04:43.359 calendar link and then I'm like always
01:04:45.160 referencing it so I'm like I'm
01:04:46.720 mentioning like hey guys like book The
01:04:48.039 15s I put it on my road map I have like
01:04:49.640 a little road map like book 315s with
01:04:51.240 these guys and I'm doing all the closing
01:04:53.000 right now so like I'll like go on my
01:04:54.480 live calls and I'll notice that two guys
01:04:55.960 who are across the country from each
01:04:57.240 other have so much in common and I like
01:04:58.640 reach out to them like yo you should
01:04:59.599 book a guy with I feel like you should
01:05:00.640 book a call with this guy because of why
01:05:03.160 XYZ and then I follow up with that later
01:05:05.039 like how' that call go and then I get a
01:05:06.960 ton of like Insight on like all my
01:05:08.599 members and like what they're
01:05:09.559 communicating outside of me cuz like
01:05:11.319 there's like a little like a power
01:05:12.839 Dynamic where like I'm the I'm the head
01:05:14.400 coach I'm the the CEO guy right so I
01:05:16.160 don't get like a lot of like
01:05:16.960 vulnerability but I can get the Insight
01:05:19.000 from my community members through each
01:05:20.119 other and the concept actually came from
01:05:21.880 when I was a frat president cuz we would
01:05:23.680 have our top 10 exec guys go on constant
01:05:26.240 15-minute lunch breaks with all the new
01:05:27.599 members and then that's how we collected
01:05:28.920 Mass information and connected guys like
01:05:30.720 pledges together before the recruitment
01:05:32.720 process so that they would have friends
01:05:34.319 before they even joined the thing and so
01:05:36.520 like the result of that is like I have
01:05:37.720 like buddies like flying down to like
01:05:39.480 Dallas to meet Gladiators who I didn't
01:05:41.880 even like like they're doing it on their
01:05:43.279 owns now because the reward is so high
01:05:44.520 they're getting like brothers so I'm
01:05:47.200 going to I want to say back to you so
01:05:48.279 the users in the community you tell them
01:05:50.119 to put like a calend link for 15 minutes
01:05:52.119 so and then whenever you see people that
01:05:54.279 you think make sense and they already it
01:05:56.119 becomes an innate rule of the community
01:05:58.119 which is like hey if you like someone
01:05:59.119 just like click their Link in book of
01:06:00.640 called they might just segment out you
01:06:02.440 know one part of their calendar where
01:06:03.480 they have you know opening to just
01:06:05.200 banter or whatever maybe they do it for
01:06:06.359 their lunch breaks and they meet new
01:06:07.400 people every day whatever it is I tell
01:06:09.520 them like an I do I do like an hour for
01:06:10.960 three days a week that's just open yeah
01:06:13.319 uh and it crushes so a lot of people do
01:06:15.799 use that almost yeah so I tested it with
01:06:17.559 like five or six guys and they they all
01:06:19.119 loved it and so I'm I'm making it
01:06:20.599 mandatory for everybody now who's using
01:06:22.240 the map are using the map the map it's
01:06:25.240 not a School feature um this this R are
01:06:28.880 you using it we have members meeting up
01:06:31.359 constantly in person that they've met
01:06:32.880 through music money and doing like
01:06:34.119 Studio sessions and stuff and that's
01:06:35.599 honestly like like you guys said like
01:06:37.400 they they equate that their connection
01:06:40.000 to being a part of Music money and so I
01:06:41.880 feel like they've you know people have I
01:06:43.520 just saw the school games not pop up but
01:06:45.480 they just people just share their
01:06:46.640 location who's in Atlanta who's in who's
01:06:48.680 in Detroit you know yeah it was
01:06:50.720 interesting I was in I'm in Ham's group
01:06:53.880 and he did the post like
01:06:56.680 what's the most valuable part of the
01:06:58.200 community and he's trying to remove some
01:07:00.319 stuff and and emphasize some stuff and
01:07:02.760 what could we what's one simple thing we
01:07:04.279 could do to improve it I was the most
01:07:06.640 common answer
01:07:08.039 was get more people to plot their
01:07:10.440 location on the
01:07:12.000 map I was like what we we actually took
01:07:16.039 that idea just a little bit further
01:07:18.319 we're not sure if it'll work yet but
01:07:19.480 it's incredibly popular it's been our
01:07:21.200 most popular piece so far which was
01:07:24.480 setting up a system system that the
01:07:26.920 community could engage on so that it
01:07:28.640 continued that flywheel sort of
01:07:30.440 perpetually and what we're calling it is
01:07:32.640 it's uh it's based off the school games
01:07:35.119 and we're just calling it rainbow games
01:07:37.000 and we just have a pile of things at the
01:07:39.279 end that you can win and the structure
01:07:42.559 is uh you'll be assigned teams between
01:07:45.480 three to five you have one team captain
01:07:48.039 they uh coordinate with our community
01:07:50.520 manager and the objective is to compete
01:07:54.880 based off of three metrics where they
01:07:56.799 are on the leaderboard from um and these
01:07:59.880 are all based on a 30-day time span so
01:08:01.720 it'll basically be one to one with
01:08:03.200 school games where where they are on the
01:08:05.680 leaderboard um what their own personal
01:08:09.039 uh score is on how much they've grown in
01:08:11.880 their own relationships and health and
01:08:14.839 then the last one is how good their
01:08:16.640 offer is based off of where they started
01:08:18.319 from before so we're using those three
01:08:19.839 different metrics people were super
01:08:20.960 jazzed about it and we had uh I think
01:08:24.439 like 30 sign up to do this thing that
01:08:27.080 we'll probably do this next week we
01:08:28.839 don't know all the little intricate
01:08:29.960 details but I think there's a massive
01:08:31.600 opportunity there whereas previously
01:08:34.000 like when you're starting probably most
01:08:35.279 of us have run into this you really want
01:08:38.120 to get a few Community managers to like
01:08:40.000 lift up from the bottom and help comment
01:08:42.759 and stir up conversation but at a
01:08:44.799 certain point when it's feeding itself
01:08:46.920 you can sort of just give that momentum
01:08:49.040 by doing top down where they are in
01:08:52.439 teams or some form of competition and
01:08:54.679 reporting to to the community manager so
01:08:57.000 now the manager is doing less time but
01:08:59.520 having more
01:09:01.399 impact yeah and the more you reward the
01:09:04.120 Top members versus trying to dig up the
01:09:05.960 bottom members those Top members dig up
01:09:08.719 the bottom members so it actually is
01:09:10.719 less it's like your model and it could
01:09:13.238 be something super stupid we the biggest
01:09:15.520 request that we've had recently is I I
01:09:17.439 designed a few profile pictures cuz they
01:09:20.080 wanted more color in their thing so I
01:09:21.560 was like all right if you're on the
01:09:22.238 leaderboard I'll go ahead and do it and
01:09:23.719 now it's one of the things that we offer
01:09:25.399 in there because people really want it
01:09:27.560 and it's silly and it's didn't you guys
01:09:29.000 design a whole Suite of gifts for school
01:09:32.479 yeah he made like a library gift forgot
01:09:35.600 about that yeah Sid said he was going to
01:09:37.920 implement them to that'd be a sweet like
01:09:39.880 level six
01:09:41.000 unlock like if you get to level six I'll
01:09:43.359 make your profile thing for you one more
01:09:45.120 question for you um and just for the
01:09:47.839 context right you said if you go back in
01:09:49.719 time make gym launch 10K a year so I'm
01:09:51.880 I'm kind of in this this new building
01:09:53.120 phase of like I'm I'm going to make my
01:09:55.000 product okay you're honestly go big head
01:09:56.480 long tail with it so like what were like
01:09:58.159 the two to three like specific things
01:09:59.719 that you would like definitely Implement
01:10:01.560 into gym launch's model back then like
01:10:03.360 with your knowledge now to actually make
01:10:05.159 people like renew year-over year yeah
01:10:07.199 okay I got to figure out where my cont
01:10:08.800 for bringing this up because this is
01:10:09.719 what it was something that I wanted to
01:10:10.840 talk about
01:10:12.400 so what everyone in my opinion what you
01:10:14.679 want to do and school's going to very
01:10:16.239 quickly be able to facilitate this so
01:10:17.640 I'm really excited about that you have
01:10:20.040 onetime
01:10:22.000 value and then you have ongoing SLC
01:10:24.440 consumable value all right and I think
01:10:26.840 the big issue it's my opinion um in the
01:10:30.520 information education space is that we
01:10:33.719 try we have one we have one thing here
01:10:36.360 that we try to build for both and so
01:10:38.719 we're like okay well I can get someone
01:10:40.080 to say yes to $3 $3,000 whatever and
01:10:43.440 because they can't pay that today I'm
01:10:44.719 going to spread it over a year and I'm
01:10:46.760 going to deliver all the onetime value
01:10:48.800 up front and then they're still making
01:10:50.880 payments of 25,000 you know $2,500 a
01:10:53.280 month uh month three month four5 six but
01:10:56.239 the problem is the
01:11:01.080 value so think about like
01:11:04.040 this value is going like
01:11:06.960 this but this is
01:11:10.320 price and this is where people
01:11:14.960 cancel
01:11:18.000 value and so when you when you sell them
01:11:20.520 initially they're like 2500 bucks which
01:11:22.920 is my first payment look at the
01:11:24.400 difference between price and value I'm
01:11:25.840 stoked this is great but the day after
01:11:28.159 you learn how to run Facebook ads when
01:11:29.719 you buy something to learn Facebook ads
01:11:31.880 the value of the content teaching your
01:11:33.440 Facebook ads descends to zero there's no
01:11:35.760 additional value right and so this is
01:11:38.920 why in my opinion this is where I think
01:11:40.800 the industry should go or will go and or
01:11:42.480 if I start it over again this is what I
01:11:43.840 would do is you have one type value that
01:11:46.320 you need to be really clear about so
01:11:47.520 this is a lot of times this is going to
01:11:48.760 be the education right um for the most
01:11:51.719 part this is this is the entirety of
01:11:53.400 this right this is the education the
01:11:54.639 checklist the tool the blueprints the
01:11:55.960 whatever right now this usually has a
01:11:58.600 lot of value because you're teaching
01:12:00.400 someone something a skill that's very
01:12:02.000 important and they're going to have that
01:12:02.920 skill forever it's one time payment for
01:12:04.199 an ongoing permanent value increase for
01:12:07.239 that but all this stuff so you've got
01:12:10.360 community right people consume that on a
01:12:12.600 monthly basis there's uh calls right
01:12:15.560 that they consume on a monthly basis uh
01:12:17.600 for us like for example we did a boiler
01:12:19.840 room which is something that we did uh
01:12:21.840 for gyms which was um we would train
01:12:24.000 their sales staff and so we would drill
01:12:25.719 them every day so we'd basically run
01:12:27.120 their sales meeting for them every
01:12:28.800 morning to increase the close rates at
01:12:30.159 the jet they didn't want to do it nor
01:12:31.760 were they good at it if we could
01:12:32.920 increase the closer to the gym they'd
01:12:34.120 make more money they'd stay right it's
01:12:36.199 consumable
01:12:37.880 um uh we had ads which for us was
01:12:40.760 consumable because I would spend 50
01:12:42.600 Grand a month testing ads in like 10
01:12:44.719 representative markets I would take the
01:12:46.080 winners and then I would give I would
01:12:47.800 license those winners to a th000
01:12:49.159 locations so there's zero cost on that
01:12:51.280 besides the 50k then everything after
01:12:52.880 that was gravy right and so that was why
01:12:54.719 it was such a High profit margin
01:12:56.000 business where still is um and so the
01:12:58.639 idea here is if you put on a on a sheet
01:13:01.920 what's the onetime value that I deliver
01:13:04.239 and then what's the ongoing value and if
01:13:06.120 you were to only do this only price this
01:13:09.520 in a way that most people are like wow
01:13:11.159 just these things alone are worth X this
01:13:13.639 becomes your ongoing
01:13:15.880 price and this becomes your
01:13:20.880 upfront and so that is the concept of
01:13:23.199 big head long tail but what you want to
01:13:24.600 do is you want to make sure that what is
01:13:26.480 being built on a regular basis that is
01:13:28.280 ongoing value is ongoing value the
01:13:31.360 things that you build one time are one
01:13:33.360 time value and so then then you can
01:13:35.520 create that described so ra so so
01:13:37.440 probably for most of these qu you know
01:13:39.760 the coaching education businesses
01:13:41.440 instead of saying okay I'm going to sell
01:13:42.520 you something for $30,000 it's $2,500 a
01:13:45.440 month it might be it's 10K up front than
01:13:47.280 $500 a
01:13:48.480 month but then no one
01:13:50.560 cancels right and so then you just play
01:13:53.320 with how do I liquidate you know cost
01:13:55.360 acquire and the thing is this is where
01:13:57.320 the patience if like if I did this all
01:13:58.600 over again like the the business model
01:14:01.719 that gets fastest to 20 million isn't
01:14:03.760 necessarily the one that gets fastest to
01:14:05.120 100 million because you might have this
01:14:07.639 price the old pricing model which
01:14:09.239 skyrockets to 20 million a year or
01:14:11.239 whatever but then like you have a really
01:14:13.199 hard time passing because turn starts
01:14:14.880 eating away at you and so you're like
01:14:16.239 shoot I need to sell more I need to sell
01:14:17.560 more but it's really tough especially in
01:14:18.840 a nich to sell more right whereas if
01:14:21.600 you're not losing the customers then the
01:14:23.400 first year you do you know eight the
01:14:25.480 next year you do you add another eight
01:14:27.520 on top you're at 16 third year you're at
01:14:29.280 24 you're like oh actually by year three
01:14:30.960 I'm a little bit above what the other
01:14:32.159 one was but the first one you're at 20
01:14:33.880 and you think you're hot [ __ ] because
01:14:35.679 you're beating the other guy who's lower
01:14:37.120 ticket right but year four all of a
01:14:39.360 sudden this guy's now at 32 and you're
01:14:41.159 still stuck at 20 you're questioning
01:14:42.280 your life and everybody hates you right
01:14:43.520 but this guy's like man the price to
01:14:44.960 value for my stuff is is through the
01:14:46.639 roof that makes sense and when you want
01:14:49.080 to sell something else you have this
01:14:50.639 massive distribution of people who love
01:14:53.159 you and your brand your reputation are
01:14:55.199 all great because you delivered
01:14:56.920 something really valuable and you
01:14:58.239 charged for it and then you deliver
01:14:59.920 something let's be honest less valuable
01:15:02.320 but then you charge
01:15:04.080 appropriately does that make sense yeah
01:15:06.760 so this allows you to have basically
01:15:09.000 price here
01:15:11.639 price and then it drops to
01:15:14.360 here for your
01:15:19.040 ongoing and so you still always have the
01:15:23.800 Delta this this is how I think about it
01:15:26.800 yeah that's super helpful I never had
01:15:28.760 like the discrepancy between the one
01:15:29.880 time and the ongoing value I would try
01:15:31.080 to Bunch the ongoing with the 6K ticket
01:15:32.880 price but now I'm going to go right and
01:15:35.280 so one thing I think is again a mistake
01:15:37.480 that most people make I mean myself
01:15:39.199 included I made this mistake um I think
01:15:41.199 it's the vast is how most people do this
01:15:43.040 in in this business is um they they take
01:15:45.560 it and they spread the the payments over
01:15:47.280 a year or some arbitrary amount of time
01:15:49.199 I would rather say like I want to be
01:15:50.679 very clear you're paying this for this
01:15:52.679 and that for that and so if you need a
01:15:55.480 payment plan we're going to front like
01:15:57.000 it's I'm not spreading over year like
01:15:58.440 you need to pay this off as fast as
01:16:00.040 possible because that's what you're
01:16:01.120 paying for and I maybe doing you a favor
01:16:02.800 like I'll split pay it I'll three pay it
01:16:04.159 or whatever and that might mean that the
01:16:05.800 ticket price like and here's the funny
01:16:07.840 thing is that everyone here knows this
01:16:10.120 who's in in the high tiet world you sell
01:16:12.040 something for $30,000 you're not
01:16:14.080 collecting 30 you collect however many
01:16:16.880 payments your turn is times 20 it's like
01:16:19.000 okay yeah but we turn at 25% a month and
01:16:21.760 we're our price Point's 2500 bucks so
01:16:23.760 really it's 10K that's what you're
01:16:25.560 actually making so whatever you claim
01:16:27.080 versus what you make are two very
01:16:28.280 different things and so if that's really
01:16:29.840 what you're making then maybe you just
01:16:31.600 charge seven and you get way more people
01:16:34.360 to say yes because the thing is is when
01:16:35.440 you have a 30k price point you still
01:16:37.040 have to make the 30k sale but you're not
01:16:39.840 even collecting 30 it's like the worst
01:16:41.199 of both it's like you have a lower
01:16:42.360 conversion because the price is high but
01:16:43.560 you're even collecting on the low
01:16:44.719 conversion and so it's like sell at
01:16:46.679 seven maybe and then let's say that
01:16:49.040 churn on the 500 is I don't know
01:16:52.560 whatever 4% right and so now of a sudden
01:16:55.239 it's 25 you're getting 25 months at 500
01:16:58.080 so you get 125 on the back seven on the
01:17:00.280 front now you're at 195 in LTV and
01:17:03.639 because you charge seven up front
01:17:05.280 instead of trying to confront uh a 30k
01:17:07.960 price point you might sell two or three
01:17:09.159 times as many and now your epcs go up 6X
01:17:12.440 because you had you trip you doubled LTV
01:17:14.800 but you might also one and a2x
01:17:17.280 conversion or double conversion so now
01:17:18.760 you Forex epcs in terms of your earnings
01:17:21.400 per click or your conversion what each
01:17:23.239 each person is worth to you this is in
01:17:25.159 my opinion the better way to run the
01:17:26.639 business most people just don't do it
01:17:28.520 and maybe in 5 years they'll find this
01:17:31.719 video and is that what made gym launch
01:17:35.159 cable no what made gy launch cable was
01:17:37.520 that um I did nothing in it and it was
01:17:40.040 very consistent and we had multiple
01:17:42.239 forms of acquisition and so I had to
01:17:44.199 basically paint the picture which was
01:17:46.000 that did you know that 30% of gims go
01:17:48.199 out of business every year and I mean
01:17:50.360 they're like oh I didn't know that I was
01:17:51.679 like right so no matter what
01:17:53.760 structurally a third thir of gyms got a
01:17:55.800 business because it's a tough business
01:17:57.400 in general and so the good news of that
01:17:59.639 also is that every year another 30%
01:18:02.360 enter the market and so we can stay at
01:18:04.600 this place and we can sell all the new
01:18:05.920 gyms that come in and that means that
01:18:07.199 this business will just you know
01:18:08.520 continue to maintain and then the
01:18:10.040 opportunity for growth is going to come
01:18:11.440 from you know some of the other things
01:18:12.880 that I had already like planted seeds
01:18:14.080 for that were going to be down the line
01:18:15.000 to increase L
01:18:16.159 TV great I just want to say that's
01:18:18.719 beautiful that's like exactly what I
01:18:19.920 needed so thank you I'm ready to like go
01:18:21.880 home and work so yeah see you guys
01:18:25.520 for real yeah that was clutch thank you
01:18:27.440 cuz with a coaching business you
01:18:29.320 answered my question that I've been
01:18:30.520 asking for like six months what is the
01:18:32.239 end goal me yeah you've been asking me
01:18:34.520 for 6 months no not you check your
01:18:36.840 myself he's like I have tagged you every
01:18:38.520 single day every day story Post Yeah
01:18:42.040 than you oh good okay great number five
01:18:44.560 we talk about how to build a community
01:18:46.159 within any business and every single
01:18:48.000 business has a community they just have
01:18:49.400 bad ones and good ones but every
01:18:50.800 business has one and so if you're doing
01:18:53.120 it the bad way there's not consistent
01:18:55.400 the second worst way is when it's just
01:18:57.159 dependent on you having a relationship
01:18:58.920 with every single customer the ideal way
01:19:01.040 is that every one of these customers has
01:19:02.840 a relationship with one another so that
01:19:04.600 if your break with them breaks they
01:19:07.280 still stick because they've got five
01:19:08.840 other connections to other people in the
01:19:10.239 community and that strengthens the bond
01:19:12.880 that's what creates a network within a
01:19:14.719 community and then it will always be
01:19:16.280 bigger than you because one person can
01:19:17.880 only have so many relationships and
01:19:19.440 that's what allows your business to grow
01:19:21.080 bigger than you this is just how I would
01:19:23.080 explain it it's like each one of these
01:19:24.480 people on the right this is the
01:19:25.719 traditional way that most people are
01:19:27.080 doing it which is that they try and
01:19:29.000 become more and more interesting
01:19:30.679 themselves model that's literally Guru
01:19:33.120 model yeah this yeah here I'll just
01:19:34.760 write
01:19:36.760 it Guru model doesn't work well for
01:19:39.400 Community by the way if you just post it
01:19:42.280 doesn't work and if everyone wants to
01:19:44.480 talk to you you're going to be exhausted
01:19:46.560 yeah yeah and so think about this so
01:19:50.440 like this is what it looks like visually
01:19:51.760 and with your eyes you can almost
01:19:52.600 immediately see the difference but the
01:19:53.760 point that I would highlight is look how
01:19:55.679 many tie-ins these people have to the
01:19:58.239 community versus those people those
01:20:00.199 people only have one tie and so likely
01:20:02.880 like if this if this breaks right this
01:20:06.239 breaks this guy leaves right he gets out
01:20:09.120 but if all of a sudden this breaks right
01:20:11.040 he you know stops talking to that guy
01:20:13.360 he's still he's not going anywhere right
01:20:15.239 or this breaks like nothing happens and
01:20:18.960 so I think a lot of the things that
01:20:20.000 we're talking about here are trying to
01:20:21.600 get to this which is like we're talking
01:20:23.560 about the maps we're talking about
01:20:24.800 15minute thing we're talking about
01:20:26.719 encouraging the engagement between them
01:20:28.719 like the whole point of all this
01:20:32.520 stuff is to facilitate that like why do
01:20:35.600 we want them to share things about
01:20:36.960 themselves and take a picture of their
01:20:38.000 car take a picture of their workspace or
01:20:39.639 or share themselves on the map it's
01:20:41.000 because then they can start orienting
01:20:43.239 themselves with one another like that's
01:20:45.639 that's how they connect with each other
01:20:47.000 because they can find similar things and
01:20:48.880 so it's like how can we create a space
01:20:50.560 that rewards them sharing things that
01:20:52.520 they can find similarities because
01:20:54.840 fundamentally they have a shared
01:20:55.840 interest but until they know the rules
01:20:57.480 of engagement they're just going to be
01:20:58.639 like okay well I do I want to get
01:20:59.639 punished for doing something and so by
01:21:02.600 having the categories by pinning exactly
01:21:04.920 what you want people to do by dming
01:21:06.480 those people afterwards like those are
01:21:07.840 all things that then encourage more and
01:21:09.920 more of this which then creates
01:21:12.800 this and then this I'm actually really
01:21:15.600 pumped that this is the direction that
01:21:16.920 the the conversation went in because in
01:21:19.159 a past you know uh probably one or two
01:21:21.239 ago we went really deep on retention
01:21:23.080 right and so there's lots of like what I
01:21:24.360 would like the hard side stuff of
01:21:26.760 retaining the community and I'm glad
01:21:28.440 that goose you're here for like to
01:21:29.920 basically have this the other side of
01:21:32.120 the conversation of retention in the
01:21:33.480 community which is the whole experience
01:21:35.239 right what are the rules of how this
01:21:36.480 community works and what do we reward
01:21:37.639 and what do we punish and I think like
01:21:40.120 I'll bet that the people were watching
01:21:42.120 this and probably you guys too you might
01:21:44.120 be able to cut your turn even more by
01:21:46.400 doing this
01:21:48.360 stuff somebody at her hand yeah shoot
01:21:50.840 yeah I have two kind of questions how do
01:21:54.360 cuz I I resonate with this a lot um how
01:21:56.719 do you go from Guru like once you
01:21:59.120 already are operating on the right side
01:22:02.560 how then would you go to the left you
01:22:03.960 don't decrease you you increase them
01:22:06.320 that's good yeah okay that answers that
01:22:08.840 the second one is for Real it did uh
01:22:12.600 okay how do you sell because I think a
01:22:15.480 lot of the conversation is pre-framed so
01:22:17.960 I used to work for a lady uh she had
01:22:20.159 4,500 members and then what she would
01:22:22.440 tell them is if you cancel you can never
01:22:24.520 never come back for a year right which
01:22:27.400 was awesome cuz people would never leave
01:22:29.560 like it decreased turn and then the
01:22:31.800 second thing was they would have
01:22:33.040 requirements like for them to
01:22:35.800 do um like what what are your thoughts
01:22:38.760 on that I've seen the the you can't come
01:22:41.880 back thing have zero effect in some
01:22:44.400 businesses because they're like yeah I
01:22:45.600 never want to come back anyways I don't
01:22:47.040 really
01:22:48.040 care um and so like it's like it's kind
01:22:50.960 of one of those chicken egg things where
01:22:52.360 like if you have a valuable Community
01:22:54.159 then people fear losing it and so then
01:22:56.520 they don't want to cancel but at the
01:22:57.760 same time if you've a valuable Community
01:22:59.239 then you've already won and so it
01:23:00.320 doesn't
01:23:01.120 matter okay well just one more point on
01:23:03.880 that question would you sell an outcome
01:23:06.639 different than you would sell a
01:23:08.520 community um I wish I could just sell a
01:23:11.639 community yeah right people have a hard
01:23:14.199 time ascribing value to community I mean
01:23:16.560 like in the gym world we used to say
01:23:18.080 sell the bikini they come for the bikini
01:23:19.840 they stay for the the community um and
01:23:22.719 like the way that you you have the offer
01:23:25.120 in terms of the outcome that they're
01:23:26.159 going to have is going to be the thing
01:23:27.239 that that's going to bring them in right
01:23:28.960 but then all of this is the stuff that's
01:23:31.760 going to get them to stay and so I would
01:23:33.199 say there's different objectives like to
01:23:34.520 get someone to convert you talk about
01:23:35.840 the outcome to get them some to stay
01:23:38.440 they're going to like you you want to
01:23:40.000 reward as many times as you can within
01:23:41.280 that community and basically it's too
01:23:43.440 arduous for one business owner to reward
01:23:46.360 every single person as many times as
01:23:47.880 they possibly can to get someone to
01:23:49.320 stick and it's so much easier to create
01:23:51.159 the system that allows the culture that
01:23:53.840 allows people to reward each other at a
01:23:56.040 way higher frequency than you ever could
01:23:58.719 as a
01:24:00.560 guru cool and I really want to like like
01:24:04.840 what's the word emphasize like The
01:24:06.360 Leverage here on this left side like if
01:24:07.760 you have a lot of client knowledge you
01:24:09.199 can connect guys and it will
01:24:10.719 exponentially increase your leverage on
01:24:12.280 how valuable your community is like for
01:24:14.080 example like like Justin right here like
01:24:15.760 you should Network I think you should
01:24:17.280 network with um other Justin over there
01:24:19.360 and maybe Pablo because you guys both
01:24:20.800 have like this commercial construction
01:24:22.400 experience right like I don't know
01:24:23.639 anything about commercial construction
01:24:25.199 because I know like one detail about
01:24:26.880 that you guys can get like a quick 15
01:24:28.679 and then you'll like associate that
01:24:29.920 connection with like the value of my
01:24:31.360 community and that connection and build
01:24:32.639 go like that so like I can like almost
01:24:34.840 like increase my leverage into like that
01:24:36.280 construction space for example even
01:24:37.719 though I don't know much about it but
01:24:39.080 it'll add so much value to the community
01:24:40.400 as a whole and it make you guys level up
01:24:41.800 too so it's like a win-win yeah this is
01:24:43.600 huge I actually sold a few people that
01:24:45.199 way somebody asked me like if I have
01:24:47.520 something on sales AI agents and I
01:24:50.199 didn't so I searched up um school and it
01:24:53.040 loaded up a few members that specialized
01:24:55.119 in this so was like if you join today
01:24:56.920 I'll connect you to XY Z who is doing
01:25:00.119 exactly this and they join for that and
01:25:01.840 then I connect
01:25:04.520 them you wor
01:25:06.639 about it's Greatful no it's good it's
01:25:10.360 good I feel like this is the visual like
01:25:12.560 I feel like this is the the main
01:25:13.679 difference like this is what all the
01:25:15.440 tactics that we were talking about
01:25:16.520 earlier this is the end result of good
01:25:19.000 culture like what happens is when
01:25:21.280 community members start getting known
01:25:22.880 like the leaders of the community kind
01:25:24.080 of get get jealous and they like they
01:25:25.760 remove them or like they punish them so
01:25:27.880 you need to work on your internal side
01:25:29.320 as well and be comfortable with people
01:25:31.800 leading your community as well for you
01:25:33.560 does that make
01:25:36.199 sense like we have yeah we have
01:25:38.040 Champions side of the school I mean good
01:25:40.400 like all the all the names that say
01:25:41.800 reference earlier like you bring the
01:25:45.080 people closer to you who you want to
01:25:47.480 encourage and create distance for the
01:25:49.920 ones who you don't want yeah I literally
01:25:52.600 never even think about that like we're
01:25:54.560 building you guys up literally like
01:25:59.040 we're trying to give you guys the fame
01:26:03.239 and
01:26:04.560 then the more we do that the better
01:26:08.560 the the community is so like
01:26:12.840 it I I don't what you're saying though I
01:26:15.000 had this realization all of a
01:26:17.480 sudden but yeah the PE if you have that
01:26:20.800 mindset you'll never have a good
01:26:22.080 Community because the moment there's
01:26:23.600 someone that has anything good to say
01:26:25.320 you're going to like kick them out yeah
01:26:27.840 exactly I'm not saying I have it I'm
01:26:28.840 saying don't have it I'm might happen
01:26:30.719 it's kind of natural with humans you
01:26:32.239 know I mean kind of get jealous of each
01:26:34.000 other you've got to be mindful of things
01:26:35.360 that might be not what they don't align
01:26:38.280 with your vision for the community like
01:26:39.920 oh everyone this thing is just way too
01:26:42.159 complicated and I think this is a dumb
01:26:44.000 idea even if people like it I I'm not a
01:26:47.360 fan of this it's not for a personal
01:26:49.960 reason I just it doesn't align with the
01:26:51.600 vision of of the thing so you you you
01:26:54.600 can't let it just go out of control you
01:26:57.360 have to shape it a little bit um but
01:27:00.360 that comes in who you reward and who who
01:27:02.320 you pull closer and
01:27:06.040 yeah yeah I mean when we we talked about
01:27:08.280 this before even thinking like when we
01:27:09.920 were coming with the idea of the school
01:27:11.239 games overall was we wanted to have as
01:27:13.960 many like school games champ like it's
01:27:15.880 the games like we want school games
01:27:17.320 Champions like that was the whole the
01:27:18.760 whole point was to elevate it cuz we
01:27:20.800 already like I already have the clout
01:27:22.800 you know what I mean it's like our to
01:27:24.360 like get as many other people so we have
01:27:26.400 lots cuz think about it this way is like
01:27:27.719 you want to have as many different walks
01:27:30.080 of life and like avatars within the
01:27:33.159 community that represent success like
01:27:35.600 within obviously within you know the
01:27:36.719 wider the Box the more buied the
01:27:37.880 community the the Champions can be but
01:27:39.600 like like I would love to like this
01:27:42.480 isn't planned this just happens
01:27:43.800 organically but it's like I'm glad that
01:27:45.280 Evelyn is a girl who's you know really
01:27:47.000 really awesome inside of the community
01:27:48.360 and there's also black guys and white
01:27:50.280 guys and older guys and young like we
01:27:51.719 had the grandmother who hit you know a
01:27:53.239 million bucks like it shows that like
01:27:55.360 anybody can do it U obviously we're
01:27:57.679 super super Broad in terms of what we're
01:27:59.280 looking at but even within the subs
01:28:00.760 segment of whatever Niche you're you're
01:28:01.880 going after you're going to have
01:28:03.080 different psychographics different
01:28:04.280 demographics that can be represented and
01:28:06.199 that's that only increases the amount of
01:28:08.159 people like this guy or this let's call
01:28:10.600 this a lady right these might be lady
01:28:13.239 people right and then this might be a
01:28:15.360 dude right and these might be dude
01:28:17.040 people but if this person can't find
01:28:19.199 connection then there's no no ties and
01:28:21.520 then she
01:28:22.400 leaves right so having different people
01:28:24.880 that represent even kind of slightly
01:28:27.159 different flavors like chocolate and
01:28:28.840 caramel chocolate and coffee like it's
01:28:31.280 like you have you have chocolate is your
01:28:32.560 community but it's like different type
01:28:33.840 different Flav subf flavors of chocolate
01:28:36.360 yeah we can definitely see those circles
01:28:38.040 in school Community like the ads people
01:28:40.280 yeah the like creators and there's the
01:28:43.679 creators guys all the like the YouTubers
01:28:46.600 then there's the there's definitely the
01:28:48.880 girls and there's definitely I call them
01:28:51.880 the Chads
01:28:55.520 Like We call we joke around at that
01:28:57.719 about that like oh that's the Chad
01:29:00.360 Network um and then there's the like the
01:29:05.040 Boomers like for sure and by the way
01:29:07.320 that's a massive population bigger than
01:29:09.560 any other generation the largest
01:29:11.480 business that we have in the
01:29:13.199 portfolio crushes with Boomers so they
01:29:17.040 have all spending power was that it's
01:29:19.440 the largest generation in the world with
01:29:21.360 the most money with the most n and
01:29:24.119 spending power like you both like sell
01:29:27.199 to them um and yeah you can start to see
01:29:31.719 these different things it makes the
01:29:33.480 culture more interesting then I'd say
01:29:35.119 the goose and GIF people
01:29:38.280 like they I honestly for a period we
01:29:40.760 were seeing posts like how do I how to
01:29:43.360 Goose instructions and like did you guys
01:29:47.119 see all of these Goose posts it was like
01:29:50.560 it Goose was taking over at one point
01:29:53.760 and then when Ryan came in with GIF I'm
01:29:56.719 not [ __ ] you the amount of our GIF
01:29:58.719 usage on across our platform spiked so
01:30:01.000 much that gify called us and said we
01:30:04.199 needed to discuss a paid Enterprise
01:30:07.000 plan and now we have to pay them a grand
01:30:09.320 a
01:30:10.400 month CU we're using 500 terabytes a
01:30:17.000 month it's a testament of culture yeah
01:30:20.480 and it's like but then everyone saw that
01:30:22.840 and they were like oh can use gifts in
01:30:24.880 my community I can use polls I can be
01:30:27.239 more like goose and they're learning
01:30:28.639 these different elements that they can
01:30:30.199 play with yeah in their Community yeah
01:30:34.080 the other one I'd say is calls calls is
01:30:36.360 getting getting some the moment you take
01:30:37.920 someone from just an avatar and some
01:30:39.520 text to being on Zoom it's like it now
01:30:42.960 you've got a a voice now you can see a
01:30:45.440 face now there's some expressions and it
01:30:48.199 there's more depth um so if you're not
01:30:50.719 doing calls this is I'm sure everyone
01:30:53.080 here is doing calls but I bet you
01:30:55.119 there's people at home that are thinking
01:30:58.239 they need to make a lot of classroom
01:30:59.920 content no I swear all you need to do is
01:31:02.639 have three posts that like introduce
01:31:04.560 yourself and share a photo of your
01:31:05.760 workspace what's your favorite book
01:31:07.719 what's your favorite movie what's your
01:31:09.239 favorite gift there's four posts that
01:31:11.600 are easy and then one call on the
01:31:13.560 calendar that could be just called
01:31:15.199 coffee hour and there's no agenda you
01:31:18.159 just hang out on zoom while you have
01:31:19.639 your morning coffee maybe once a week
01:31:22.679 three times a week whatever
01:31:25.760 done then let it happen first right and
01:31:29.119 then you can figure out okay I'm going
01:31:30.920 to make this little module cuz this is
01:31:32.520 what then you can start serving your
01:31:34.280 community but it has to be there before
01:31:35.760 you know what they want right and then
01:31:38.119 you start serving and you keep adding
01:31:40.880 things and curating and then it's more
01:31:43.400 valuable so now maybe you charge and now
01:31:45.960 maybe you increase the price over time
01:31:47.880 and do you see what I'm saying like
01:31:50.159 that's all you need to start we're
01:31:52.679 actually going to hide the class tab
01:31:54.560 when you create a new community H well
01:31:57.040 we looked at retention making a course
01:31:59.239 has no correlation to retaining as a
01:32:03.159 customer in fact it's one of the reasons
01:32:05.560 why people turn right cuz they say I
01:32:08.560 don't have a camera right I don't have a
01:32:12.119 lighting setup and I will come back when
01:32:15.000 I've made my
01:32:17.239 content yeah no
01:32:19.840 [ __ ] so it is and it has no correlation
01:32:22.719 with retention so we're like okay let's
01:32:24.239 just hide that Tab and let's just get
01:32:26.119 encourage people to make a calendar and
01:32:27.639 do three simple posts and then bring
01:32:30.000 people in down now the engagements
01:32:32.480 happening and then you learn you don't
01:32:34.600 have to write article posts you don't
01:32:37.639 need to this isn't substack like you
01:32:40.400 don't have to sit down and like invent
01:32:43.199 these articles all the time you're not a
01:32:46.440 writer you're you're bringing people
01:32:49.719 together it's it's a there's a
01:32:52.480 difference there but it's very hard for
01:32:54.719 people to grasp for some
01:32:57.360 reason there was something that that you
01:32:59.520 were mentioning before about
01:33:02.480 um I I'll take it to to take it one step
01:33:05.520 further it it's come up once
01:33:08.440 but a lot of times the offer that you
01:33:11.400 have this isn't for everybody but it's
01:33:13.880 quite easy for an offer to be hard to to
01:33:16.000 sell um and the person that needs it
01:33:18.320 can't recognize it when they see it but
01:33:21.080 fundamentally you can kind of always
01:33:23.080 understand something like a Mastermind
01:33:24.199 or a coffee hour and so if you sell that
01:33:27.159 and you give them what they need you
01:33:29.080 almost always score like I think we have
01:33:32.159 like 98% retention for across all of
01:33:35.880 them just because we reversed everything
01:33:40.119 so that we're we bring them in on what
01:33:41.800 they want but we give them what they
01:33:43.040 need and it it just works every time and
01:33:45.600 it's something that maybe you guys
01:33:47.480 couldn't could also run with because
01:33:49.159 it's a I mean it's it's a showstopper
01:33:51.679 for sure and by that you mean they come
01:33:53.960 in for the funnels they stay for the fun
01:33:55.880 no they come in for the Mastermind they
01:33:57.159 stay for the funnels all
01:33:59.440 right bit stickier yeah we started the
01:34:02.920 other way yeah it just worked better the
01:34:05.520 the fun is just kind of like a cherry on
01:34:07.800 top like it it's it's sort of I mean
01:34:09.760 you'll see it in kind of like the
01:34:10.760 Captivate branding I literally analyzed
01:34:13.239 every little [ __ ] pixel and I was
01:34:14.560 like how can I get more attention from
01:34:17.199 one glance and so it was colors it was
01:34:20.480 um bizar it was cussing whatever
01:34:23.719 whatever it had to be it was just like
01:34:25.199 just be whatever came naturally not like
01:34:28.040 forcefully and then from that point the
01:34:30.760 fun was like a nice introduction and a
01:34:32.600 good tone a good cultural tone but
01:34:35.199 everything else was just yet trying to
01:34:36.679 situate and that was where our big
01:34:38.520 roadblock was and when we reverse that
01:34:40.719 like almost on accident it completely
01:34:42.760 changed everything else yeah how many
01:34:45.159 people here are teaching someone how to
01:34:46.679 make money or do something to with
01:34:48.639 business what I think you'll find
01:34:50.679 fascinating is that most people don't
01:34:52.400 want to start a business
01:34:55.199 no like really I learned this after
01:34:57.600 talking to Big YouTubers they're like oh
01:34:59.719 but now that's a business and I was like
01:35:01.400 yeah and they like I don't want
01:35:04.239 that so like most people don't want a
01:35:08.000 business what they really want is they
01:35:10.280 want to like feel good and have fun that
01:35:13.040 explains the whole world how many
01:35:16.560 people how many people are at the
01:35:18.679 [ __ ]
01:35:20.960 Library ver vers
01:35:24.679 versus playing computer games or like
01:35:27.840 you know watch watching movies or like
01:35:30.920 going to bars right like how much money
01:35:34.239 gets spent on like going to bars and
01:35:37.000 video games and everything versus
01:35:39.800 everything else um it's it just that
01:35:43.520 shows you that's what people want more
01:35:45.600 than anything but I think once you
01:35:46.880 become an entrepreneur it's even harder
01:35:48.560 to see once you become a hardcore
01:35:49.960 entrepreneur as you think everyone's
01:35:51.560 kind of like you but most I can tell you
01:35:54.159 most people aren't and no one is yeah
01:35:56.400 like I mean 9% of people have a business
01:35:58.239 and that like that means literally like
01:35:59.560 own an LLC so that includes like hair
01:36:01.320 stylists who are Solo prur so 9% so if
01:36:04.560 you cut out solo prur and then just go
01:36:07.880 people who have employees you're looking
01:36:09.760 like one out of every I I don't know
01:36:11.360 what the stat is but I would imagine
01:36:12.560 it's probably one out of every 50 people
01:36:15.119 actually has a a business with employees
01:36:17.679 like it's not a lot of
01:36:19.159 people this is why I think the fun
01:36:21.400 element is really important cuz I've
01:36:23.239 seen a lot of people say this they were
01:36:25.000 like I never wanted to start a business
01:36:27.639 or be an entrepreneur until I knew it
01:36:30.560 could be
01:36:31.719 fun right like it's I think that's how
01:36:35.280 you make the market bigger for sure like
01:36:38.679 if you want to get more people people to
01:36:40.639 buy your thing and all of that I think a
01:36:42.159 lot of it comes from not
01:36:43.800 just more training or more like
01:36:47.600 explaining or more like logical Concepts
01:36:50.960 and Frameworks I think it's trying to
01:36:53.679 make
01:36:54.679 it more fun and interesting to people
01:36:58.480 does that make
01:37:00.199 sense yeah that's why I was excited
01:37:02.760 about these recent breakthroughs that
01:37:04.199 we've had
01:37:05.760 because it's it directly translates to
01:37:09.199 the actual thing you want which is
01:37:10.600 retention sales Word of Mouth by the way
01:37:14.199 like all of the things that we dream of
01:37:17.000 but it it comes from tapping into this
01:37:20.320 slightly different thing I love that we
01:37:22.000 had classroom
01:37:24.280 done it yet I think it's a great idea
01:37:25.760 this next clip is about strategy which
01:37:27.960 is my fancy word for prioritization
01:37:30.440 fundamentally we all have a certain
01:37:31.840 amount of time money effort people that
01:37:34.360 we can allocate across a million
01:37:36.520 different things and so the idea is the
01:37:38.639 people who move the fastest in business
01:37:40.679 make the Best Bets because they choose
01:37:42.760 to allocate those resources to the
01:37:44.440 things that get them the best returns
01:37:46.080 and this is how to pick which ones you
01:37:47.599 should so we're we were selling before
01:37:49.639 we built the program okay so as I'm
01:37:51.800 actually using time to create the
01:37:53.119 content and get the program out there's
01:37:55.239 less time to get more people in so the
01:37:56.760 revenue goes down as we're building so
01:37:58.920 how would you fix
01:38:03.280 that aren't you guys
01:38:06.360 Partners you you're not solo are
01:38:09.520 you you split the responsibilities maybe
01:38:13.480 one on growth one on
01:38:16.159 building that's a great way yeah okay
01:38:19.520 thank
01:38:20.679 you nailed it and also you're going to
01:38:23.639 work a lot it's as a side note like
01:38:25.560 you're just going to work a lot yeah we
01:38:27.199 work all day already yeah oh we also
01:38:29.719 have one more person Kirby who does like
01:38:32.760 Community
01:38:33.920 Management so we divided it even more
01:38:36.520 like I'll just think about making it
01:38:38.080 better Kirby will run it operationally
01:38:40.440 and hosi will bring people in do you see
01:38:44.080 mhm that makes sense so get like
01:38:45.760 potentially more people if needed if not
01:38:47.719 just split the work yeah for
01:38:49.560 everything's going down because you're
01:38:51.320 like you
01:38:54.440 the point I was making earlier about the
01:38:55.760 classroom thing is like I would not want
01:38:57.239 you to overproduce content for the
01:38:59.080 classroom since the vast majority of
01:39:00.480 people they quote want to buy it but
01:39:02.119 they don't actually consume it um and
01:39:04.480 they consume the community far more than
01:39:05.800 they consume the content and so I would
01:39:08.159 like try and make it as paired down as
01:39:11.280 you possibly can to increase the likel
01:39:12.840 that they do consume it and get value
01:39:14.199 because if they see a ton of videos they
01:39:16.159 just say like nah but if you say like
01:39:18.400 guys the whole thing you can cover in
01:39:19.840 less than two hours then the likely that
01:39:22.000 they're going to watch it goes way up
01:39:24.440 does that make sense so I would just not
01:39:25.920 don't kill yourself on it try and think
01:39:27.840 what are the actual few things they need
01:39:30.040 in order to be successful just make that
01:39:32.040 so that you can still focus on basically
01:39:34.040 keeping keeping the business going yeah
01:39:36.040 perfect thank you um how to revive a
01:39:40.000 dead Community right so one of our
01:39:41.599 partners um they got in school very
01:39:43.679 early on and it just grew very massively
01:39:46.520 before we had buil out our
01:39:47.560 infrastructure they have 14,000 members
01:39:50.520 just dead Community is just dead I think
01:39:52.199 a lot of people in the school community
01:39:53.440 haven't even been in there probably in
01:39:55.239 weeks months um I think one time there
01:39:58.679 was a lot of like Bots and stuff and we
01:40:00.320 hadn't gotten that system in place and
01:40:01.679 that kind of probably like wasn't good
01:40:03.440 and then um so yeah how to revive that
01:40:05.639 community so it can be more of a nurture
01:40:07.159 to the paid so this is your free
01:40:10.119 community uh into into music money no
01:40:13.199 this is so yeah we we work with a lot we
01:40:15.719 have a bunch of different communities
01:40:17.119 okay um this is one of our free
01:40:18.760 communties it's called Kingdom Minds
01:40:20.400 okay yeah they have like 14,000 members
01:40:22.480 and they're paid community is doing well
01:40:23.920 cuz we do webinars right and we just
01:40:26.199 sell that but the free community itself
01:40:28.520 is just yeah like not 95% of people are
01:40:31.280 like at level one essentially like you
01:40:33.080 know they may do an introduction and
01:40:34.440 then that's all they ever do so like
01:40:36.280 just well is there anything you guys
01:40:38.239 have in mind like to bring that back to
01:40:40.360 life makes sense did you do the same
01:40:42.360 thing that Zayn did where like the
01:40:43.880 people went into the free thing you sold
01:40:45.239 all the engaged people no and I think
01:40:46.920 that's definitely part of it but even
01:40:48.239 the most engaged people in the free
01:40:49.800 group of that one are the people from
01:40:51.280 the paid group they stayed over there
01:40:52.800 and still engaged but it's like we can't
01:40:55.480 elicit more engagement out of people
01:40:57.080 they they're like oh I want to join you
01:40:58.639 know they join make a profile and then
01:41:00.239 they're like you know we don't know how
01:41:02.440 to make it like a part of their every
01:41:03.760 day kby do you have anything they you've
01:41:06.840 hurt yeah I would like launch for
01:41:09.560 something exciting like a challenge or
01:41:12.480 something that is going to get people
01:41:14.520 excited but why reactivate why do you
01:41:16.800 want to reactivate what problem does it
01:41:18.119 solve well it's just 14,000 members and
01:41:20.040 I'm just like you know I feel like do a
01:41:21.920 few broadcast post and there then move
01:41:24.280 on do you post in that much um so yeah
01:41:27.639 we have a school manager that's making
01:41:28.920 posts in there um are they good posts
01:41:31.840 it's okay post you know about like
01:41:33.320 content nothing honestly a lot of the
01:41:35.239 game that we got in right now about like
01:41:36.599 you know making it more funny and
01:41:37.920 entertaining will definitely like you
01:41:39.080 know add that in there's been more value
01:41:40.480 based and more like hey we got a free
01:41:42.719 training which is the webinar so it's
01:41:44.080 probably a lot more CTA what problem
01:41:45.440 does the group solve um it's about
01:41:48.880 social media you know no like why no no
01:41:50.920 not not not for them like why does it
01:41:53.280 exist for you uh as an upsell as a as a
01:41:55.800 funnel to go to the paid community and
01:41:57.280 to so it's the lead magnet it's the lead
01:41:59.159 magnet well really the webinar is so
01:42:01.280 here's the thing so the webinar is the
01:42:02.520 lead magnet but we have a web hook that
01:42:04.199 takes people to the free community so
01:42:06.000 people were just getting into the free
01:42:07.560 community after the web webinar so we
01:42:09.719 don't even have their data on like phone
01:42:11.360 numbers and stuff so all we have is
01:42:12.599 their email from schol let me ask this
01:42:13.920 if you just didn't have the free
01:42:15.080 community would everything still work
01:42:16.560 fine yeah so maybe maybe maybe you just
01:42:20.360 have a paid community and you just run
01:42:22.480 ads to your webinar sell people into the
01:42:23.920 paid community and that's I just I think
01:42:26.040 the only reason we'd want to get it
01:42:27.199 better is just for discover you know be
01:42:29.480 on the Discover yeah one point we were
01:42:30.920 top 20 the community was top 20 cuz it
01:42:32.719 was growing so fast and then now it's
01:42:34.360 like I don't even know it's like up
01:42:36.159 there so it's just kind of like we have
01:42:37.800 this a bunch of members in there like I
01:42:39.400 mean we could deactivate it but do you
01:42:41.360 have any super users no yeah they
01:42:43.960 they've already upgraded the paid
01:42:45.320 members essentially they're still over
01:42:46.840 on the free community but yeah it's just
01:42:48.840 you know our our only point of really
01:42:50.440 getting it back alive would be to get on
01:42:52.880 the Discovery I think you know overall
01:42:55.360 like raising engagement to get on
01:42:57.360 Discovery page would be the ultimate
01:42:58.599 goal I want to add something when it
01:43:00.480 comes to the post so you have a
01:43:01.840 community manager right mhm do they have
01:43:04.000 their own accounts or do they use your
01:43:05.800 accounts they they use the the person's
01:43:07.960 account the yeah the owner's account
01:43:10.040 okay yeah because if somebody else makes
01:43:12.159 a post but they're a community manager
01:43:14.639 nobody will pay attention because people
01:43:16.280 join because of you are the artist right
01:43:18.840 so yeah great point though I me think I
01:43:21.679 think if you were going to try and
01:43:22.440 engage it I think doing basically doing
01:43:24.480 something exciting that is valuable for
01:43:26.239 those people will get them to be excited
01:43:28.280 and then I would just I I would I'd
01:43:30.639 balance that with Sam's question which
01:43:32.560 is like why do you even
01:43:35.360 bother well if you do re-engage it one
01:43:39.080 thing that we did that was quite
01:43:40.239 successful when we were doing the
01:43:42.080 rainbow games thing was One requirement
01:43:44.199 was you had to tag people that were less
01:43:46.239 active than you that you'd like to
01:43:47.639 compete with and it was actually
01:43:49.360 surprisingly successful yeah that's
01:43:51.639 interesting sweet
01:43:54.800 any of else come up questions St mind
01:43:58.159 otherwise I'm going to grab out of this
01:43:59.360 bag of of there was some that were
01:44:01.119 interesting cuz all the ones left we've
01:44:03.520 pretty much covered at previous ones
01:44:05.840 right yeah they're like standard topics
01:44:08.440 but there was some that were kind of
01:44:09.920 unique this time around
01:44:12.239 like
01:44:14.880 um and I I think this kind of relates
01:44:17.360 somewhat to what you just said which
01:44:19.480 is what is the next lever to pull mhm
01:44:23.560 it's like cuz you know there's a million
01:44:26.679 things you could do like reactivate this
01:44:28.360 dead Community but I swear you your time
01:44:30.360 would be better spend doing something
01:44:31.800 else yeah like how do you find that next
01:44:34.560 live at a pull yeah so this is like so
01:44:38.599 that question fundamentally for everyone
01:44:40.320 here like if you could walk away with
01:44:42.040 that being correct would be in my
01:44:44.480 opinion the most valuable thing that you
01:44:45.840 can do to walk away from here cuz you're
01:44:47.119 going to have two pages three pages of
01:44:49.599 notes from today and what's going to
01:44:51.159 happen is you're going to get on a plane
01:44:52.719 and you're you're going to have a fresh
01:44:53.920 piece of paper and you're going to go
01:44:54.960 through your notes and then you're going
01:44:55.920 to write like a list of like three
01:44:57.320 things that you're actually going to do
01:44:58.960 and then that's actually what you're
01:45:00.000 going to end up doing from today that
01:45:01.880 will be the output of this day and so I
01:45:04.159 just want to make sure that and then of
01:45:06.000 those three things one of them will have
01:45:07.520 by far a disproportionate impact on how
01:45:09.159 much money you make and so most small
01:45:12.840 businesses or even even midsized
01:45:14.639 businesses don't grow as fast as they
01:45:16.440 could because they spend their time
01:45:17.520 doing the wrong things it's and the
01:45:20.080 what's what's deceptive about it is you
01:45:22.960 you can make an argument that
01:45:24.520 reactivating this group can make the
01:45:26.560 business more money there's a lot of
01:45:28.040 things that can make the business more
01:45:29.159 money the question is just which of
01:45:30.360 these things will make it the most money
01:45:32.560 and so by doing that we have to reverse
01:45:35.719 back into we had those four levers that
01:45:37.760 I had earlier we've got traffic we've
01:45:39.320 got conversion we've got price and then
01:45:41.159 we've got churn so those are the big
01:45:42.560 four things and so if we want to grow
01:45:44.520 the business those levers have to change
01:45:46.800 or the business will not grow and
01:45:49.480 so for many of you it might just be you
01:45:52.520 need more traffic like the business
01:45:54.760 model is fine the economics are fine and
01:45:57.679 you need more traffic and so basically
01:46:00.080 at least my thought process that I have
01:46:01.880 with this is I try and scale as much as
01:46:04.440 I possibly can until something breaks
01:46:07.119 and then when it breaks we fix that
01:46:08.960 thing and then go back to scaling the
01:46:11.080 [ __ ] out of it again I mean
01:46:12.960 fundamentally that's what we do and um I
01:46:16.199 mean I I teach this at at for for
01:46:18.400 businesses but I'll I'll I'll walk you
01:46:19.920 through it
01:46:28.760 uh so what is going to go to these four
01:46:31.760 levers that we talked about earlier
01:46:33.639 right which is going to be your
01:46:37.119 traffic your 2f there whatever
01:46:39.840 conversion which is you tweaking your
01:46:41.639 about page making a vsl that's better
01:46:43.840 adding Carousel images tweaking the
01:46:45.679 bullets that you have on your landing
01:46:46.880 page uh you've got the price which you
01:46:48.880 can test and then you've got churn right
01:46:51.520 which has a big list of things that you
01:46:52.679 can do so these are the four levers the
01:46:54.840 things that you're doing have to Lad up
01:46:56.199 to one of these four if it doesn't lad
01:46:57.360 up to one of these four things why are
01:46:58.400 you doing it all right so like if we
01:47:00.119 were to translate your objective with
01:47:01.360 the free group you would have to say
01:47:03.280 okay I think that the US reactivating
01:47:06.199 the free group will increase traffic
01:47:08.400 that's fundamentally what you're doing
01:47:09.360 you want this traffic source to make you
01:47:11.119 more money from your to towards your
01:47:13.159 ticket High ticket thing and you say
01:47:15.000 okay how much work will it take me to
01:47:17.639 reactivate this group okay is there
01:47:19.639 anything else that could get me more
01:47:21.000 traffic than reactivating the group of
01:47:23.360 the things that I have available so
01:47:24.719 right now could me just spending more
01:47:26.159 money on ads or making better ads make
01:47:28.520 us more than me spending the time to
01:47:30.199 reactivate the group if so forget
01:47:31.760 reactivating the group make better ads
01:47:34.360 or spend more money on ads does that
01:47:35.840 make sense so once you figure out and
01:47:37.920 when we're picking which of these three
01:47:39.199 things or four things that you're doing
01:47:41.320 the thought process is what which of
01:47:43.040 these is the biggest constraint in the
01:47:44.199 business and so if conversion rate let's
01:47:47.280 say for example on the on the landing
01:47:48.639 page is super low then it might mean
01:47:50.000 like hey before getting more traffic I'm
01:47:52.840 I'm going to I think I can double my
01:47:54.360 conversion on this page cuz I haven't
01:47:55.679 really spent any time on it at all okay
01:47:57.520 well then it makes sense to spend a day
01:47:58.840 or two like can I really clean this up
01:48:01.239 and make it as crisp as humanely
01:48:02.520 possible with the language that I use
01:48:03.760 can I grab screenshots that are more
01:48:05.000 meaningful that like you probably had
01:48:07.560 more testimonials things like that you
01:48:08.920 haven't updated like can I put that on
01:48:10.480 there can I make an actual 3-minute vssl
01:48:12.840 that that is more compelling than the
01:48:14.239 one that I just like tossed up there
01:48:15.800 okay that's probably a day of work well
01:48:17.480 it's probably high leverage because I
01:48:18.760 can double the growth of the business by
01:48:20.560 just improving this conversion metric
01:48:22.400 pricing
01:48:23.360 like well if everybody just pays you
01:48:24.480 more we already went through that
01:48:25.360 example over here um this could
01:48:27.679 obviously make you more money and then
01:48:28.800 you have your big list of things that
01:48:29.719 you're doing for turn and so cool which
01:48:32.639 of these is the biggest uh thing that's
01:48:34.080 going train in the business you pick the
01:48:35.239 one that you're working on and then for
01:48:37.280 me I tend to think through
01:48:40.800 this more better new and I tend to do it
01:48:46.440 in this order most of the time
01:48:50.400 so like I will just ask when portfolio
01:48:53.080 to is like why can we not just do more
01:48:54.719 of what we're currently doing like
01:48:56.199 whatever we're doing why can't we just
01:48:57.400 do more so you'd have to make an
01:48:58.880 argument to me that we should reactivate
01:49:00.360 the group rather than just spending more
01:49:01.480 money on ads and you have to make an
01:49:03.360 argument that it's easier and it will
01:49:04.880 make us more money than spending more
01:49:06.040 money on ads and if you came out the
01:49:07.840 argument they' be like well then forget
01:49:08.840 about it if we can't do anymore for
01:49:11.040 whatever reason we have some limitation
01:49:12.480 like we can't post more than twice a day
01:49:14.040 on Instagram like we just can't or we
01:49:16.080 can it just like we've seen that when we
01:49:17.639 post three times it doesn't doesn't yeld
01:49:19.320 the same performance so two is kind of
01:49:20.400 The Sweet Spot fine all right then what
01:49:22.360 can we do to make it better right okay
01:49:24.960 cuz if we can make those two posts just
01:49:26.880 higher quality overall can we like
01:49:28.159 really think through the hooks can we
01:49:29.320 make sure that they're take that they
01:49:31.199 appeal ideally to the audience that
01:49:32.679 we're looking for if we do better then
01:49:35.040 the quality of the traffic will go up
01:49:36.280 the more views will go up does that make
01:49:38.400 sense now if we can't do any more any
01:49:39.920 better then we need to try something new
01:49:41.679 and you notice that most of the times
01:49:42.760 you can do more of what you're doing you
01:49:44.400 can do what you're doing better which is
01:49:45.719 why I so rarely do new things once you
01:49:47.760 have something that works that's the
01:49:48.960 hard part once it works it's like how do
01:49:50.560 we scale the living crap out of it and
01:49:52.080 the reason that most entrepreneurs in my
01:49:53.280 opinion especially small ones get stuck
01:49:54.639 is that they find something that works
01:49:56.000 and they stop doing
01:49:57.280 it and then they get distracted by six
01:49:59.960 other new things and they get completely
01:50:01.800 spread thin and it's and like what's
01:50:03.320 ironic is that the small business owner
01:50:05.800 is the one who has the least amount of
01:50:07.360 Leverage and you have the basically your
01:50:10.360 your contribution your time contribution
01:50:12.199 to the the income of the business is
01:50:14.119 more direct than anybody else's
01:50:15.920 especially at this level and so like you
01:50:18.080 like saying okay I'm going to take a
01:50:19.040 third of my time that might just be like
01:50:20.199 decreasing your business by a third um
01:50:22.320 it's have a very strong argument for why
01:50:24.199 that's going to make sense and then for
01:50:26.040 who once you have a team then that
01:50:27.840 becomes the the next thing it's like
01:50:29.199 okay we know we going to increase
01:50:30.199 traffic the way that we're going to do
01:50:31.599 that is like we can't do more posts on
01:50:32.760 Instagram so we're going to make them
01:50:33.679 better and this is the process that
01:50:35.199 we're going to focus on getting better
01:50:36.280 which means that uh once a week I'm
01:50:37.840 going to take three hours and I'm going
01:50:39.840 to script out I'm going to look at other
01:50:41.159 people's you know content that have
01:50:42.480 really good hooks I'm going to write
01:50:43.480 down all the hooks and then I'm going to
01:50:45.280 make content that I think is going to
01:50:47.239 appeal to my demographic in a better way
01:50:49.599 cool now who's going to be you know if
01:50:52.040 it's you then you're the who in a lot of
01:50:53.679 these if the business gets bigger then
01:50:55.320 it's like okay Jeremy you're running
01:50:57.400 this and then we just measure to make
01:50:59.440 sure Jeremy does his job that makes
01:51:01.599 sense in terms of thinking through this
01:51:03.079 and so we just want to make sure that
01:51:04.159 what you are doing is going to map to
01:51:06.599 what's going to drive growth within the
01:51:08.800 business and I swear to God so many
01:51:11.599 times people are just doing [ __ ] that
01:51:13.079 does not map to
01:51:15.040 this okay Red's
01:51:17.960 over one quick question on that the the
01:51:20.239 first four is there like a certain
01:51:22.119 priority that you would recommend for
01:51:23.480 like I'm a solo operator I'm doing like
01:51:25.280 50 a month BC offer is there like one of
01:51:27.800 those big four that you would recommend
01:51:28.880 prioritizing first you start here okay
01:51:32.960 because this is how you have lifeblood
01:51:34.400 in the business so you have to promote
01:51:36.480 you have to acquire customers once this
01:51:38.440 is relatively consistent even at a low
01:51:40.360 level I then this is me how I think
01:51:42.360 through this now not when I was younger
01:51:44.719 normally I would just be like just do as
01:51:46.079 much of this as you can forget
01:51:47.360 everything else now it's do enough of
01:51:50.040 this so that we can keep working on how
01:51:53.719 do we how do we find the things that
01:51:55.239 people actually want versus what we
01:51:56.599 think they want and then there the
01:51:58.199 things that we can remove like how can
01:51:59.760 we delete things how can we make this
01:52:01.079 simpler how can we make it more elegant
01:52:02.360 how can we shorten the the modules that
01:52:04.679 we have I mean we're hiding classroom
01:52:06.760 for new people like think about this
01:52:08.360 like we remove three calls a week like
01:52:10.000 we're trying to take things away not
01:52:11.560 because we don't want to add it's easy
01:52:12.599 for us to add the value it's but we want
01:52:14.560 we want them to consume it and so
01:52:16.159 consumption should be the highest
01:52:17.280 priority for everybody here in terms of
01:52:19.119 making like how do they get value they
01:52:20.719 have to consume value right so
01:52:22.040 consumption should be the highest
01:52:23.000 priority and so um we start here until
01:52:26.960 you have enough flow going through the
01:52:28.800 system that we can see what they really
01:52:31.320 want and a lot of times these simple
01:52:33.280 things like the last master I think we
01:52:34.800 went through a ton of depth of all the
01:52:37.119 things that you can do to reduce T right
01:52:39.280 it's like so you experiment with that
01:52:40.520 and this might be months while you're
01:52:41.960 doing this I mean for context school
01:52:43.639 didn't hit like a like let's go
01:52:45.639 hyperscale until like recently and this
01:52:48.239 was years right of getting the product
01:52:50.199 right like obviously like there's people
01:52:52.079 coming in every day and there was a
01:52:53.599 enough promotion that we basically we
01:52:55.520 could test and keep learning but it
01:52:57.520 wasn't like we don't want the world to
01:52:58.960 find out about it yet because we want to
01:53:00.119 get all these pieces right once these
01:53:02.119 pieces are right enough then you go back
01:53:04.440 here and you scale living hell out of it
01:53:06.880 boom y it's
01:53:10.159 great so right now the question for you
01:53:12.960 is if you have really low turn I don't
01:53:15.360 know if you do but from what you were
01:53:16.400 saying it sounds like you have low turn
01:53:19.440 then then yeah do more traffic yeah do
01:53:21.960 more do better of what you're currently
01:53:23.599 doing so you're are you running ads yeah
01:53:25.679 so you'd spend more spend more and Mak
01:53:27.040 them better top 20% of my best customers
01:53:30.560 targeted towards them now that I have
01:53:32.239 that insight and then just keep making
01:53:33.239 that better and then just more more
01:53:35.440 better and then just spend 400 Grand a
01:53:36.880 month on ads yeah
01:53:39.760 sure I mean it's like an inside joke in
01:53:41.880 my business like he's just going to say
01:53:43.760 more better it's like y that's what
01:53:45.360 we're going to do this quarter just like
01:53:46.280 we did last quarter just like we did the
01:53:47.360 quarter before we're going to do more
01:53:48.360 we're going to do better and if we do
01:53:49.199 both of those things we'll probably make
01:53:50.159 more money and then if there's something
01:53:52.480 that prevents us from doing more or
01:53:53.480 better then we fix that and then we go
01:53:54.760 back to more
01:53:57.800 better does anyone have questions about
01:53:59.840 what they need to do for
01:54:01.960 this like like you need you're like okay
01:54:04.400 am I should I be spending more money
01:54:05.719 well if you're if your LTV is good in
01:54:07.719 terms and you're and your and your CAC
01:54:09.320 is low then yeah I just keep
01:54:11.239 spending I guess for like low ticket
01:54:13.520 communities you know recently you had a
01:54:15.159 video where you went like seven things
01:54:16.920 like a handwritten letters on boing exit
01:54:19.520 interviews for communities on school
01:54:21.360 like which one of these you go after it
01:54:23.400 the first kirby I feel like you have
01:54:25.800 even more insight with you the price
01:54:28.520 sounds like the thing that's moving at
01:54:30.400 say again the price okay because you've
01:54:33.440 already experienced what that's doing
01:54:35.239 right you know the average is around 20
01:54:37.360 you probably want to be on the good side
01:54:38.880 of that so figure out why you're
01:54:41.960 not like I would talk to your customers
01:54:44.599 first like why did you cancel you want
01:54:46.480 to talk to the people that cancered you
01:54:47.800 want to talk to the people that stayed
01:54:49.800 and you want to figure out what
01:54:51.119 differences they have
01:54:53.079 and then if you find the people that
01:54:54.639 stayed did these things emphasize those
01:54:57.679 things if you find the people that left
01:54:59.199 did other things remove those and so it
01:55:02.239 might not be price I'm just yeah it but
01:55:04.719 you told us so um maybe it's price so
01:55:09.159 like balance that and then you know with
01:55:13.440 your traffic you you can drive more of
01:55:17.040 that and then you can play with about
01:55:19.480 page conversion you can play with that
01:55:21.719 and then when you're both of those go
01:55:22.960 back to retention CH I know I can drive
01:55:26.119 like easily way more traffic it's just
01:55:27.800 that I have a leaky bucket so I want to
01:55:30.079 fix it so I'm like wondering if I should
01:55:31.599 add the onboarding or you know events
01:55:34.000 onboarding I think for sure is a good
01:55:35.480 idea and how would you execute that for
01:55:37.119 low ticket you do a group onboarding and
01:55:39.520 everybody who signs up gets one group
01:55:42.400 onboarding that you attend you do it
01:55:44.639 once a week yeah I think people throw a
01:55:46.880 lot of [ __ ] in their community and then
01:55:48.320 they just keep adding and then they
01:55:50.480 think they need to keep adding to make
01:55:51.840 it better
01:55:52.840 but it's not true like overwhelm is the
01:55:55.000 main cause of churn think about the
01:55:57.239 experience so how many things in the
01:55:59.320 classroom would you say is like The
01:56:00.560 Sweet Spot cuz like right now I have
01:56:02.440 like eight
01:56:04.920 maybe honestly the hardest part I found
01:56:07.280 when improving anything is to figure out
01:56:08.760 what's actually wrong with it that but
01:56:11.719 I've been working on the school games
01:56:13.000 funnel recently by the way homos will be
01:56:15.159 happy about this
01:56:18.199 um I figured out like what the problem
01:56:21.320 to try to figure out what the problem
01:56:22.679 was was actually quite difficult but in
01:56:25.800 the was my it was this guy I knew from
01:56:28.760 New Zealand who's a complete stoner that
01:56:31.920 had text me when hosi when hosi launched
01:56:35.040 the games he couldn't understand what it
01:56:37.280 was and I was not going to try to
01:56:39.440 explain it to him but when we came back
01:56:41.760 to making this improving it I was like
01:56:45.079 it turned out that he was the best
01:56:47.040 signal for it actually what the [ __ ] is
01:56:50.040 the school games I wrote it down that
01:56:52.480 was the problem if you didn't know what
01:56:54.320 school was you have and you see an ad
01:56:56.520 from homos he's talking about the school
01:56:57.880 games and some leaderboards and coming
01:56:59.239 to Vegas people don't know what the [ __ ]
01:57:01.840 that is so I wrote down what the [ __ ] is
01:57:04.880 the school games and I was like that is
01:57:06.480 the
01:57:07.440 problem so but that took me a lot of
01:57:10.159 research to to like find right I was
01:57:14.040 talking to a lot of people I was doing
01:57:15.520 this with Kirby it's quite an
01:57:16.960 interesting process right and then we
01:57:19.520 were like okay well how do we describe
01:57:21.639 this damn thing in a way that is Mak
01:57:24.360 sense to like a stoner dude um because
01:57:28.520 it helps to use extreme cases like Steve
01:57:30.920 Jobs tested products on children because
01:57:33.679 like if they could understand it anyone
01:57:35.599 could understand it right
01:57:38.560 so like defining the problem and then
01:57:42.159 coming up with different ways you could
01:57:43.679 solve it I've been doing this with goose
01:57:45.239 and Kirby and the office all week we
01:57:47.560 probably designed we came up with many
01:57:49.480 different ways to describe what it is
01:57:51.480 many different landing pages many
01:57:53.800 different bullets and we just kept
01:57:56.760 talking to users getting feedback and
01:57:58.679 kept iterating it we probably made 30
01:58:01.840 versions some of them were so wrong it
01:58:04.199 was I wondered what kind of
01:58:07.280 tangent you'll never see
01:58:10.360 it but you know we actually at the end
01:58:13.119 of about one week we landed on something
01:58:15.920 and um and now everyone we show it to
01:58:18.159 instantly gets it it's like we don't
01:58:20.079 actually have to fully launch to find
01:58:21.920 out
01:58:22.960 out when you learn how you can use
01:58:25.440 everyone to get like feedback and talk
01:58:27.239 to people and show it to people and get
01:58:28.639 their reactions you can do a lot of fast
01:58:30.920 iteration Cycles without the harshness
01:58:34.239 of like reality then when you launch it
01:58:36.840 into reality you have a way B chance
01:58:39.239 right um so that's how you improve
01:58:42.920 anything like that that's not the games
01:58:46.000 but that's what we were doing to the
01:58:47.400 games recently we Kirby was doing
01:58:50.480 interviews with all of the winners
01:58:52.920 that was overwhelming not many people
01:58:54.440 were showing up so we cut that we just
01:58:56.520 did one hosy Q&A a week right attendance
01:59:00.880 is up every viewing is up people are now
01:59:03.920 saying that it's way more
01:59:06.960 valuable and you know so
01:59:10.880 it's we were unlocking the one day
01:59:13.199 recordings after you got three customers
01:59:16.000 we like why are we making it hard to get
01:59:17.960 the most valuable
01:59:19.920 thing now you just need three members
01:59:22.320 they can be
01:59:23.320 free right so like what do people value
01:59:26.520 how do we make more people experience
01:59:28.639 that what do people not value take it
01:59:30.079 out what do people not understand reword
01:59:33.239 it you see it's all the same but I I
01:59:36.320 will I will I will emphasize what I'm
01:59:38.400 saying is that there's a it's so much
01:59:40.079 more work than you expect it to be and
01:59:42.119 everyone wants like the one silver
01:59:43.480 bullet that you're going to magically
01:59:44.679 fall on it but if it were obvious you
01:59:46.400 would have already done it and so it's
01:59:48.440 like it's disguised and that's what I
01:59:50.599 mean this is literally what makes
01:59:52.040 business hard and so I'll have a
01:59:54.400 business owner on a Q&A call say like
01:59:55.920 what should my price be and I'm like I
01:59:57.320 don't know I'll walk you through the
01:59:58.520 process of how I'd figure it out but I
02:00:00.079 don't know your avatar I don't know your
02:00:01.280 traffic scores I don't know the value
02:00:02.639 prop of your community and even if I did
02:00:05.159 I would say I'll start here and I'm
02:00:07.440 going to do the math and I'll move it
02:00:09.199 and I'll do the math I mean with a
02:00:10.679 portfolio same thing I was telling I was
02:00:12.040 like we tested 50 35 25 15 we just
02:00:15.159 tested it I was like I don't know we'll
02:00:16.599 find out and then they were all the
02:00:19.920 same and then I was like okay well which
02:00:21.800 business would I prefer and then we go
02:00:22.920 into that right and so just just in
02:00:24.960 terms of thinking through things like
02:00:26.320 the amount of effort that goes into it
02:00:28.480 that most I would say that like as I've
02:00:30.040 gone as I've G moved up in business the
02:00:33.000 my understanding of the level of effort
02:00:34.280 that's required to solve complex
02:00:35.360 problems has gone up
02:00:37.199 100x it's just significantly harder to
02:00:40.040 solve more complex problems and that's
02:00:41.800 also why the biggest paydays are on the
02:00:44.599 other side of those problems because if
02:00:46.639 they were really easy to solve everyone
02:00:47.719 have already solved
02:00:48.840 it so it's like 4 hours and a cup of
02:00:51.040 coffee and a bunch of data you're like
02:00:52.199 all right let's try
02:00:54.159 this there's a quote I learned from the
02:00:56.480 software engineers at school they say
02:00:59.280 you have to make every detail perfect
02:01:02.000 but the only way you can do that is to
02:01:03.599 limit the amount of details that you
02:01:05.400 have so inside of the school games we
02:01:07.639 have eight videos all of them together
02:01:09.840 are less than 45 minutes one course we
02:01:12.679 do one call per week and that's
02:01:15.520 it and once a month you get a download
02:01:18.320 from here the Mastermind that's it very
02:01:22.119 easy to explain to someone one call one
02:01:24.920 course one Mastermind a
02:01:26.800 month and there's 13,000 people in there
02:01:29.719 each paying 99 a
02:01:31.440 month and they get the school
02:01:34.880 software that a question yeah so there's
02:01:38.760 a fine balance between because if you're
02:01:41.159 a leader of a big Community right if
02:01:43.560 you're showing up too much you kind of
02:01:46.079 almost lose your power right and if you
02:01:49.040 do q&as every single day nobody one it's
02:01:52.800 not special so how would you balance Q&A
02:01:55.360 calls making posts inside of the
02:01:57.199 community and just showing up and like
02:02:00.639 giving people attention like that I'm
02:02:03.239 sure there's a data answer for this
02:02:04.840 rather than me just guessing we can
02:02:06.440 probably find it out of like what the
02:02:08.320 the best you know Cadence is I'll tell
02:02:10.239 you I personally I think post twice a
02:02:11.840 month in school that's not planned I
02:02:14.400 just I just kind of poke around and I
02:02:16.760 see what people are struggling with I
02:02:17.880 made that Niche post because I was
02:02:19.199 really tired of people like what's my
02:02:21.440 niche going to be about I was like
02:02:23.159 here's how you find your Niche and so
02:02:25.800 it's just like I just listened to what
02:02:27.199 was the like there's you probably
02:02:28.599 noticed this in your communities there
02:02:29.760 probably like a pro like a problem dour
02:02:31.719 it's like people just kind of glob on to
02:02:33.639 a single problem all of a sudden and
02:02:35.199 like I felt like I was seeing more and
02:02:36.599 more of that so I was like all right I'm
02:02:38.480 going to try and answer this and so then
02:02:40.440 you make that and then it's like
02:02:41.440 hopefully and if it does if you put the
02:02:43.280 thing in and then that problem still
02:02:44.440 exists then you didn't do it right so
02:02:46.520 it's like you have to do it again you
02:02:47.480 have to make it simple you have to make
02:02:48.440 it easier whatever it is you keep doing
02:02:50.159 it until that one goes away and then
02:02:51.360 like the next problem will occur and the
02:02:52.880 good news is that your customers will
02:02:54.679 always have problems yeah and so you
02:02:56.800 just solve them I can tell you a good
02:02:59.040 thing that works for
02:03:00.520 me um so I spend a lot of my
02:03:04.000 time reading what people are saying like
02:03:07.040 I'm trying to understand what things
02:03:08.480 people are struggling with so I'm not in
02:03:11.040 there just posting a lot I'm in there
02:03:12.599 listening the most more than anything
02:03:15.280 else most it would be like 90 it would
02:03:18.480 be like a lot of time is spent listening
02:03:21.280 trying to figure out what is going on
02:03:24.119 what should I improve what problems is
02:03:25.760 the community facing right then when I'm
02:03:28.800 pretty sure I've got those problems I'll
02:03:32.040 even talk to some power users and I'll
02:03:33.920 validate do you think these are actually
02:03:35.920 problems right and then I'll make sure
02:03:38.320 I'm clear on the problems first okay now
02:03:40.679 if I spend now prioritize them what's
02:03:43.400 the most what is the most pressing
02:03:45.400 problem okay number one now I'll just
02:03:46.920 focus on that at least I know if I just
02:03:49.599 fix that I'll add some value right yeah
02:03:52.119 so now I'll try to fix that and I will
02:03:55.840 try to fix that by research
02:03:58.119 experimentation Etc and then I'll come
02:04:00.520 back to my community and say hey I saw
02:04:02.360 all you guys were facing this that
02:04:06.559 sucks I fixed it here you
02:04:10.760 go and that's how I like that's how you
02:04:13.280 add value seriously no like I I have
02:04:16.159 this little template on my wall for
02:04:17.719 emails which is uh hey I made this thing
02:04:20.079 for you here's what it does good
02:04:23.280 afternoon enjoy like CTA like that's
02:04:26.719 like that's my email template like it
02:04:28.800 just makes it really simple like hey you
02:04:30.079 guys were struggling with this thing I
02:04:31.280 made this for you here's why it's
02:04:32.800 important goodbye the hard part is
02:04:34.800 finding the thing yeah like I said how
02:04:37.679 do we make the school games funnel
02:04:39.360 better well what's the problem with it
02:04:42.480 that's the real
02:04:43.800 question and it was some Stone a dude
02:04:46.119 who had the
02:04:48.159 answer yeah so you wouldn't have a
02:04:50.320 schedule of like daily or second like
02:04:53.400 every second day or definitely not
02:04:55.880 that's like a Henry Ford production line
02:04:59.040 for Community like we're not trying to
02:05:01.199 pump out posts fast that's not what
02:05:03.920 makes a that's robotic that's not that's
02:05:06.559 not a good Community a good Community is
02:05:09.119 something
02:05:10.440 that understands your pain and
02:05:13.480 experience and delivers Solutions and is
02:05:17.320 fun yeah you're right yeah and isn't
02:05:20.520 overwhelming
02:05:22.239 and doesn't make me read five articles a
02:05:25.040 day I like value Post Yeah cuz I don't
02:05:29.119 want to read a bloody article that's a
02:05:30.880 pain in the ass like I want a
02:05:33.840 solution or I want to
02:05:36.400 laugh one of them
02:05:39.400 yeah so I have a question if you guys
02:05:42.040 had to decide on building like a an
02:05:44.280 Adonis school or an anime shreds which
02:05:46.760 would be your
02:05:48.679 choice I actually don't understand the
02:05:50.639 question so
02:05:52.159 the the model that they have like you
02:05:53.320 look at Adonis school and he's got loads
02:05:55.159 of um uh delivery in the calendar
02:05:58.599 section like every day twice a day uh
02:06:01.079 and it's a higher price point and then
02:06:02.599 you got Anime shreds which is you know
02:06:04.719 nothing in the calendar but loads of
02:06:07.639 posts like just emojis and random stuff
02:06:10.440 which is a better model for
02:06:12.119 actually helping more people get in
02:06:14.159 Greater scale and then eventually making
02:06:15.480 more money with
02:06:17.480 that well I guess we'll find out
02:06:21.920 if you guys had to pick one which would
02:06:23.199 you which would you pick well I've
02:06:25.199 watched both of them the anime shoes
02:06:27.000 one's super interesting
02:06:29.400 because it broke a lot of like
02:06:31.960 preconceived ideas like it had no
02:06:34.679 classroom when it launched it was $1 and
02:06:36.880 it grew to 100 Grand a month faster than
02:06:38.800 anything and became number one on
02:06:41.079 Discovery right like real fast and there
02:06:44.040 wasn't a ton of posting in the from the
02:06:46.520 owners it was mostly driven by the
02:06:49.040 members right um plus I know their their
02:06:53.119 about page conversion rate is one of the
02:06:54.880 highest what I'm really curious about is
02:06:57.040 their churn but I guess that time will
02:06:59.280 tell it's new but I think the fact they
02:07:01.440 started low and then increased higher
02:07:03.159 makes it's a good move for churn and I
02:07:05.599 also know churn is low when your price
02:07:07.119 is lower so that will be quite
02:07:10.000 interesting to watch over
02:07:12.639 time and so can it scale I know hams is
02:07:16.679 trying to scale higher in a donor school
02:07:19.440 I I think animation R SK apparently want
02:07:22.159 to scale more both people probably want
02:07:25.199 to do as least work as possible right so
02:07:30.400 there's that and then there's the
02:07:33.040 retention and we'll like over time we'll
02:07:35.520 see like how those two
02:07:37.599 models differ I think what anime shs
02:07:41.360 wasn't just the price though I think
02:07:43.719 what they showed us is
02:07:47.079 that if
02:07:48.920 you if you have like some
02:07:52.159 unique like the fact that it was called
02:07:54.199 anime shreds and the artwork yeah that's
02:07:57.320 that definitely added
02:07:59.679 something um that's kind of what Goose
02:08:01.920 showed us if you make something a little
02:08:03.559 bit more
02:08:05.119 unique and that's just like free
02:08:07.920 performance right like if you can make
02:08:10.320 your landing page conversion double by
02:08:13.119 just theming things and making them a
02:08:15.000 little bit more
02:08:16.320 interesting that for sure is really good
02:08:20.480 like I would encourage you everyone to
02:08:22.079 think about that um but I can't say
02:08:25.440 which model was better anim shs converts
02:08:28.360 way higher but Adon school is way more
02:08:31.719 expensive and they're both making around
02:08:33.960 the same amount per month it'll come
02:08:35.800 down to epcs earnings per click so
02:08:38.360 fundamentally if 100 clicks go to Adon
02:08:40.400 school and 100 clicks go to and this is
02:08:42.920 this to be fair is purely contrasting
02:08:45.480 the business and like the community
02:08:47.400 because traffic sits outside of that
02:08:49.639 because if animation R 10x is their
02:08:51.599 traffic they will become 10 times bigger
02:08:53.239 than than Adonis School independent of
02:08:56.520 what they did inside of the box and so
02:08:57.800 if we're just isolating conversion right
02:08:59.679 price and churn then you look at what's
02:09:01.880 the if I have 100 clicks how much are
02:09:04.719 these clicks worth for this business
02:09:06.320 versus this business and then that
02:09:08.199 literally just gives you the objective
02:09:09.480 measure of which one of these creates
02:09:11.280 the most
02:09:13.079 dollars because I'm kind of at a point
02:09:15.040 where I'm like I you guys start the
02:09:17.079 school games and great they've got that
02:09:18.960 platform for us and then I said okay I'm
02:09:20.520 going to copy what you guys doing with
02:09:21.760 the school games and how you run things
02:09:23.040 and I copied Adonis school and gang
02:09:25.760 because that was the guy at the top
02:09:27.159 right now anime shreds looks like he's
02:09:28.920 going up there and I'm at a point where
02:09:30.040 I'm like which which model is better and
02:09:32.480 which one's actually yeah cuz I'm not
02:09:34.719 that good at business I just see things
02:09:35.960 that work and I copy it you're not bad
02:09:37.800 well there's going to be more there's
02:09:39.559 going to be more so if you keep
02:09:40.800 switching you're going to get in trouble
02:09:42.199 exactly that's where the stick the
02:09:43.480 sticky honestly like even saying it like
02:09:45.400 that me thinking about it is like it's
02:09:47.880 probably neither it's probably the one
02:09:50.079 that that is more
02:09:51.840 like authentic I've got a feeling as to
02:09:54.320 what it might be but you know all right
02:09:56.360 what is
02:09:57.119 it the feeling yeah what my feeling to
02:10:00.480 do with it is it goes a bit opposite
02:10:02.800 there cuz I'm doing 17 lives a a week in
02:10:05.760 my paid at the moment
02:10:07.920 so yeah but my my feelings telling me to
02:10:10.760 put it in the free community but I mean
02:10:12.079 that might be stupid cuz I'm trying to
02:10:13.119 listen to what you guys are saying
02:10:14.199 you're saying no we're just doing one
02:10:15.280 now and it's like so I'm a bit the [ __ ]
02:10:18.440 you know I think if you want to use all
02:10:19.840 that like all that so last last games a
02:10:23.400 ton of people I think it was last games
02:10:25.719 it was like it was like the lives games
02:10:27.199 it was like everybody was doing like
02:10:28.960 Instagram lives it might have been maybe
02:10:31.040 two ago um and that the thing is is like
02:10:33.920 we have to separate promotion from
02:10:35.480 delivery so from a promotion perspective
02:10:38.079 you're doing lots and lots of lives
02:10:39.400 you're making lots of posts you're
02:10:40.480 making all this stuff oh no I understand
02:10:42.639 I got you and so my point is is like I
02:10:45.040 would take all that energy and put it
02:10:47.079 into promotion so you get way more
02:10:49.400 people into your community and and then
02:10:51.559 the thing is is that you if you do 17
02:10:53.880 lives a week externally it's okay that
02:10:57.199 people don't consume all of them because
02:10:58.920 if they consume one of them then they
02:11:00.199 might buy whereas if you're inside of
02:11:02.639 the community and you're doing 17 they
02:11:04.599 might be like Oh I'm missing out on 16
02:11:06.800 out of the 17 I'm not I'm not getting
02:11:08.599 the value if it's free your cost is time
02:11:12.239 and so as long as you deliver a return
02:11:14.520 on the time that they spend consuming
02:11:15.760 your content then they got they have a
02:11:17.400 positive exchange with you and so you
02:11:19.960 basically it's like you can never
02:11:20.800 promote too much you can put too much
02:11:22.760 inside of the community and so I would
02:11:24.119 take some of that Juju and put it
02:11:25.760 externally to drive more through the box
02:11:28.000 I think H actually did like the opposite
02:11:30.360 like when he increased the daily coffee
02:11:33.199 to like nearly every day um his turn
02:11:35.840 like reduced massively so I have no idea
02:11:39.119 uh he's messaging me like every day
02:11:42.760 and trying to figure out like all kinds
02:11:45.239 of things around churn at the moment um
02:11:49.040 I my answer to him he kept coming up
02:11:50.679 with ideas my answer to him was talk to
02:11:52.480 your customers I recently was pretty
02:11:54.400 public about this is that like I widened
02:11:56.360 my content for I think either 3 or 6
02:11:58.280 months I like started sprinkling in some
02:12:00.440 other other pieces I talked about how I
02:12:02.760 eat and like Lea you know how Lea and I
02:12:05.079 run you know being married and things
02:12:06.719 like that and the the the problem is
02:12:09.679 that you do get positive reinforcement
02:12:11.360 from it and so it's like he made some
02:12:12.800 stuff on relationships and then people
02:12:13.960 are like oh this is awesome but the
02:12:15.639 thing is is like the wrong people were
02:12:17.000 saying it was awesome and so what was
02:12:18.719 happening is my audience was growing but
02:12:20.040 it was growing with the wrong people
02:12:21.800 and so I had I mean I had this moment
02:12:24.520 where like sometimes you have these like
02:12:26.000 I had a a friend of mine come into a
02:12:29.079 friend acquaintance i' say flew in and
02:12:30.960 was like um and he probably does 10
02:12:33.000 million bucks a year and uh and he was
02:12:35.079 like yeah you know um yeah I don't I
02:12:37.199 don't listen to to much of your stuff
02:12:38.599 anymore and he's like yeah I was
02:12:39.520 Hardcore for like six years um and then
02:12:41.480 I I just kind of um I guess it didn't
02:12:43.480 really apply to me anymore he's like I
02:12:44.639 guess I'm not really like your avatar
02:12:45.920 and I was like you're 100's [ __ ]
02:12:48.920 Avatar like you are exactly who I'm
02:12:51.360 going after and then I was like oh I'm a
02:12:54.119 [ __ ] and I just basically it's like you
02:12:56.679 you get you get it's a balance you like
02:12:59.559 you want to listen to customers but you
02:13:00.639 also want to make sure you're listening
02:13:01.320 to the right customers and so um I
02:13:03.840 reoriented all my my content which maybe
02:13:06.040 some of you guys have seen um and it's
02:13:07.960 been 100% back to business has been the
02:13:09.960 the theme that we have internally my
02:13:11.239 guys now um is that if it's not business
02:13:13.040 we don't make it just very
02:13:13.960 straightforward like it can be business
02:13:15.920 adjacent so like if I talk about you
02:13:17.719 know prioritizing like tasks in my day
02:13:19.520 that can have some element of
02:13:20.440 productivity into to it but it's like
02:13:21.800 all my examples are going to be business
02:13:22.960 related and so but by doing that when I
02:13:26.880 looked objectively across metrics for
02:13:29.440 site conversion opin Book Sales
02:13:32.040 applications to the portfolio all of
02:13:33.920 those metrics went up even though the
02:13:35.559 average view per video went
02:13:37.920 down and so it's like I'm not in this to
02:13:40.199 get famous I'm in this to make money
02:13:42.159 cool question um I wonder if anybody has
02:13:45.119 I this might be for everybody but like
02:13:46.520 has anybody done anything to when they
02:13:48.199 do have a turned customer to get them
02:13:50.599 back into to being a customer or send a
02:13:53.599 funny gift you just send a funny gift in
02:13:56.360 a DM ask credit perur you have you seen
02:13:59.480 him yeah ask him for his message he's
02:14:02.440 apparently got some message he DMS
02:14:04.320 people with a funny gift and it gets
02:14:06.599 people to reactivate it say it's like
02:14:08.280 something like leaving so soon is kind
02:14:10.040 of like the vibe is kind of yeah but you
02:14:11.599 want to get the funny gift of course
02:14:13.679 yeah and it's just within school yeah
02:14:15.880 okay so no email SMS or anything like
02:14:17.880 that our sales team has that for uh
02:14:19.360 ghosted leads a Kevin Hart meme that's
02:14:22.599 like I think that might be it I think
02:14:25.559 that's what he's using
02:14:27.360 yeah and uh yeah it like it gets higher
02:14:30.320 response rates than any any message this
02:14:32.320 next clip is about growing the business
02:14:34.119 even Beyond you meaning who are you
02:14:36.360 going to bring on your team to help you
02:14:38.159 get to where you're trying to go and if
02:14:39.480 the people that you're bringing on keep
02:14:41.920 being dumb and making stupid mistakes
02:14:43.920 it's not their fault it's yours and the
02:14:45.639 good news is it's a skill that you can
02:14:47.480 fix and in this part I'll break down how
02:14:49.800 I get the best talent how we recruit
02:14:51.400 them how I hire them and how we train
02:14:52.920 them so they can win hiring related
02:14:54.679 stuffing delegating low stuff just
02:14:58.000 delegating low leverage stask so I can
02:14:59.520 focus on like be specific well for me I
02:15:02.639 know that if I spent 100% of my time on
02:15:05.040 just YouTube making YouTube videos I can
02:15:07.239 get to like 100k or even 150k a month
02:15:09.880 but right now it's like 15 to 20% of my
02:15:11.880 time so just everything else but what is
02:15:14.239 that well building the modules
02:15:16.280 delivering the product um calls
02:15:18.960 appearing on calls
02:15:22.520 everything about Community because you
02:15:24.440 kind of need to do all of those things
02:15:26.239 yeah
02:15:27.800 yeah but like there is a lot of stuff
02:15:29.840 like you know maybe emails like sorting
02:15:32.800 priorities like calendar all of those
02:15:34.880 things like could be outsourced so like
02:15:36.520 I'm wondering in what order like do I
02:15:39.360 hire so I can basically spend 100% of my
02:15:41.320 time on the thing I have the most
02:15:43.559 expertise in well building out the
02:15:45.679 modules is Mo mostly a one-time thing
02:15:49.239 and then once that's done that'll be off
02:15:50.599 your play
02:15:52.400 the emails are 100% Outsource they're
02:15:55.360 plenty of copywriters who can write
02:15:56.559 emails for you and I'd recommend taking
02:15:58.199 somebody who's in the community who
02:15:59.400 knows your voice and can give you like a
02:16:01.040 good V1 draft and then you just tweak it
02:16:03.000 and send it the calls you want to
02:16:07.480 basically just show up like that's I
02:16:09.960 mean more or less that's kind of how we
02:16:11.480 run this like I show up we do the Q&A
02:16:13.599 and then I move on with my life and I
02:16:15.000 treat it just like it's a meeting and I
02:16:16.280 do it on my meetings day cuz I do
02:16:17.760 meetings on Mondays and so we do it on
02:16:20.239 that day cuz it's the lease disruption
02:16:22.000 for how I work and so if you have so I
02:16:26.400 I'm I'm going to have a really big piece
02:16:27.639 about this coming out soon but basically
02:16:28.960 the difference between maker and manager
02:16:30.239 time so if you have deep work that's
02:16:32.679 what I consider maker time and a lot of
02:16:34.359 people in any organization you got
02:16:35.638 copywriters video editors coders like
02:16:38.318 they have they have to just like get
02:16:39.558 really deep into a project and you want
02:16:40.920 to minimize time on meetings as as much
02:16:43.000 as possible so that they can work
02:16:44.280 basically when they're on a meeting
02:16:45.318 they're not working there are managers
02:16:47.760 which is the opposite which is for them
02:16:49.359 being on meetings is working right right
02:16:51.478 uh and coordinating between things and
02:16:52.840 talking to vendors and uh I mean like
02:16:54.959 sales guys customer support like those
02:16:56.478 are those are people who like when they
02:16:57.959 meet is when they work and so those are
02:17:00.760 both fine the problem is when they
02:17:02.080 intersect and so managers start
02:17:03.959 interrupting makers uh from making and
02:17:06.879 the problem is that makers only have 14
02:17:09.558 time blocks a week you've got one
02:17:10.840 morning block and one afternoon block
02:17:12.359 and that's it like I'm sure when you're
02:17:13.398 making a YouTube video it's not like you
02:17:15.040 can't split it between two meetings
02:17:16.599 right like you need a whole big chunk of
02:17:18.080 time managers though can spread their
02:17:19.879 time in 15minute increment
02:17:21.558 and so they have 20 time slots a day but
02:17:23.478 a Maker only has two and if you take one
02:17:25.638 maker slot up it's like you just killed
02:17:27.000 one 14th of my week right and so there's
02:17:29.120 a disproportionate cost for a manager
02:17:31.240 compared to a maker when it comes to
02:17:32.879 calendaring now you're the entrepreneur
02:17:34.638 because you're like how why is this
02:17:35.638 relevant for me is that you do both and
02:17:37.879 so what's been I me like if I had to bet
02:17:40.160 like my single greatest return on time
02:17:44.120 habit that I have was that the first 6
02:17:46.959 hours of my day since I was poor has
02:17:49.558 always been zero meetings
02:17:51.840 and it was just that well shoot but
02:17:54.000 people started calling cuz I had Rick
02:17:55.280 and mortar you know gym people started
02:17:56.679 walking in at 5:00 a.m. right so I was
02:17:58.558 able to take you know like lock my door
02:18:00.478 to my office um and I just was like
02:18:02.920 morning sessions I don't I don't
02:18:04.359 participate in but as of 10:00 a.m. I
02:18:06.799 would then start working and being out
02:18:08.679 there so from 4:00 to 10: was my 6 hours
02:18:11.120 every day and then from then on I just
02:18:13.040 knew it was just fires but that still
02:18:16.080 allowed me to move the ball forward so I
02:18:17.398 only got a maker like basically five
02:18:19.359 maker slots during the week but then on
02:18:20.799 Saturday Sunday I got four more so I got
02:18:23.160 nine blocks of time throughout the week
02:18:25.240 that I could do like major big work and
02:18:27.679 so if you can look at orienting your
02:18:29.240 calendar so that I mean now I only have
02:18:31.519 one day which is Mondays where I do any
02:18:33.920 coordination or any calls or anything
02:18:36.080 and the rest of my week is truly empty
02:18:39.200 like truly I can show you my calendar
02:18:40.920 it's empty and that takes time to get to
02:18:44.280 but that's because that's like the team
02:18:46.160 knows that if I have an empty calendar
02:18:47.519 we make more money and so for you you
02:18:50.959 have to try and push as much into that
02:18:53.398 one day as you possibly can and that
02:18:54.760 also means that if someone's like hey
02:18:55.840 I've got this person that you should
02:18:56.879 meet and it's on a Wednesday in the
02:18:59.000 afternoon and it's one meeting you just
02:19:01.160 say no yeah I think I honestly have to
02:19:03.359 do but that's the only time I can make
02:19:04.519 then you're like then I guess we're not
02:19:05.439 going to meet I think I have to do the
02:19:07.080 time study you suggested like the timer
02:19:09.000 every 15 minutes cuz like it's you know
02:19:11.318 it's kind of hard to go in retrospect
02:19:13.200 like where did the entire day go like
02:19:15.799 but like you're working all day but like
02:19:17.599 what was achieved right maker time like
02:19:20.799 when you have a maker block you know
02:19:21.840 exactly what you're going to be doing
02:19:23.558 you have the one thing that you're
02:19:24.478 working on and sometimes it takes five
02:19:26.679 blocks in a row to get that one thing
02:19:27.799 done like what the [ __ ] is the school
02:19:29.679 games like I'll bet you it took more
02:19:30.959 than one maker I know it did but I'm
02:19:32.679 saying and in terms of the people you're
02:19:34.318 hiring like especially at a small
02:19:35.760 business scale like do you is it better
02:19:38.398 to just hire somebody who can get the
02:19:39.799 job decently done or should I wait like
02:19:41.478 until there's like a killer um that's a
02:19:45.280 that's a tough question um I it's a it's
02:19:48.398 a super tough question I would say that
02:19:50.240 it's going to basically you can you can
02:19:51.920 see the Arbitrage between how much more
02:19:53.800 you get back for the time basically so
02:19:56.640 let's say we take let's just do an
02:19:58.000 example let's say you bring in a
02:19:59.200 mediocre email writer if the defici the
02:20:02.399 discrepancy between how good your emails
02:20:04.520 are versus their emails but the time you
02:20:07.120 save not writing the email goes into
02:20:09.640 YouTube for example if you can make up
02:20:11.600 the trade then it's worth
02:20:14.439 doing does that make sense I think you
02:20:17.319 would benefit the most from just a
02:20:18.720 generalist person so someone who's
02:20:20.760 hardcore fan of yours already emerging
02:20:22.760 in the community is already doing the
02:20:24.120 stuff kind of for free probably would be
02:20:26.640 stoked to work with you won't cost you
02:20:28.439 too much money and we'll learn
02:20:29.720 everything as you go with you and
02:20:31.840 they'll just do everything that doesn't
02:20:33.200 make sense for you to do probably like
02:20:35.200 you probably have a few customer support
02:20:36.840 tickets or emails they'll do those I
02:20:39.439 mean M already does that for me but oh
02:20:41.359 you already have someone the issue is
02:20:43.080 that he's still in school so it's like
02:20:44.280 part-time basically so I probably need
02:20:46.319 one more person quit just get him to
02:20:48.880 quit yeah get him to quit he's 16 yeah
02:20:51.080 get him to quit is that legal is that
02:20:53.200 legal
02:20:56.200 um D you're going to learn so much more
02:20:59.040 doing this [ __ ] but his mom would kill
02:21:00.800 me I think well don't don't say don't
02:21:03.640 blame it on him yeah don't blame it on
02:21:05.080 him that's all fight his
02:21:08.200 mom David y'all definitely need group on
02:21:10.600 boarding though ASAP bro that's like the
02:21:12.640 next thing up for y'all that's I I
02:21:14.200 learned group on boardings from the
02:21:15.520 first day one recordings y'all need
02:21:17.160 those ASAP bro yeah another thing is uh
02:21:21.160 you could get an EA like if you have
02:21:23.040 some like tedious tasks like when I got
02:21:24.800 my executive assistant it like saves So
02:21:26.520 Much Time on My play if it's just like
02:21:28.280 tedious things are a little bit simple I
02:21:29.720 don't know if you you probably have like
02:21:31.120 a bunch of stuff that's like simple
02:21:32.120 stuff that you have to do that you could
02:21:33.600 just pay somebody like you know like
02:21:35.720 offshore Talent like you know anywhere
02:21:37.160 from like six to eight bucks an hour to
02:21:38.720 do that yeah David do you have a Setter
02:21:41.359 like anybody in your DMs no bro you need
02:21:44.760 that ASAP too bro a Setter in your DMs
02:21:46.800 and group onboarding calls and your your
02:21:48.920 community is about to your turn will go
02:21:51.000 way down and you'll get a lot of would I
02:21:53.040 give somebody my school password to go I
02:21:55.439 mean you'd probably set up a mini chat
02:21:56.920 account or G like one of these other
02:21:58.600 people you're talking about yeah we're
02:21:59.920 talking about in your uh social media
02:22:01.920 yeah yeah like drive like everything
02:22:03.399 from YouTube to the page cuz it's
02:22:05.080 YouTube oh okay sales do you don't have
02:22:08.439 any following on social media well
02:22:10.319 everything go on YouTube basically like
02:22:11.600 no Instagram no nothing like that I mean
02:22:13.800 not really are you collecting any phone
02:22:15.640 numbers oh no so even in you're free
02:22:18.439 school you don't ask the most simplest
02:22:19.920 funnel possible he's he's younger
02:22:21.399 generation man they don't do this [ __ ] I
02:22:24.319 mean like people are telling me to add
02:22:26.280 email right and like eventually I
02:22:28.319 probably have to add it but like I like
02:22:29.960 my simple funn you know so dude I didn't
02:22:31.720 send emails for 9
02:22:34.359 years Jim said no emails
02:22:38.000 wow I I I say that to point out at the
02:22:40.520 extreme of like whenever people are like
02:22:41.760 you have to like you don't have like
02:22:43.319 there's no col them hm did you collect
02:22:45.720 them yeah I mean I collect them cuz I
02:22:47.280 like I felt like I had to but like I I
02:22:49.319 did nothing with them like truly nothing
02:22:52.479 that eventually I hired someone and they
02:22:53.800 just send an emails and I just like was
02:22:55.120 like I don't want to read them like I'll
02:22:56.840 kill everyone how many more years do you
02:22:59.359 have in school uh two in high school and
02:23:02.760 then I mean well he's your bottleneck
02:23:05.240 cuz he's school is your bck
02:23:07.680 okay school is my B neck for school yeah
02:23:10.439 your constraint yeah for sure pick
02:23:16.319 one if you're going to get if you're
02:23:18.080 going to get into entrepreneurship then
02:23:19.399 like whatever you know I mean I mean I I
02:23:22.000 I try not to to tell people to quit high
02:23:23.720 school but like I just don't think it
02:23:25.520 like so your fingers worth it to quit
02:23:28.600 just it's just the system is so like
02:23:30.760 what are you learning yeah I mean right
02:23:34.120 not much yeah
02:23:36.319 right you're like so I want to not learn
02:23:38.880 a lot of stuff so that I can learn not
02:23:40.479 much for most of my time I get it like I
02:23:42.920 mean I it's very tough I get that but
02:23:45.000 it's still like yeah if you're going to
02:23:46.200 go to Mid school or like be a lawyer or
02:23:49.279 be an investment banker or work at
02:23:50.920 Goldman Sachs or like maybe you were
02:23:53.200 going to do computer science at Stanford
02:23:56.040 then sure stay in school but if you're
02:23:58.640 not going to do that it's useless yeah
02:24:01.279 if you going if you're going to
02:24:02.040 entrepreneurship then like there is no
02:24:03.359 degree that's
02:24:04.399 required okay yeah just a thought even a
02:24:07.680 business degree is crap oh yeah it's
02:24:09.479 irrelevant yeah I have a I have a
02:24:11.520 similar we well we have a similar
02:24:13.040 problem with delegation so for the
02:24:15.840 promos and for all the engagement that
02:24:19.240 Justin has to do in the community it's
02:24:22.319 hard to find time to like balance both
02:24:25.000 of both those two both of those things
02:24:27.479 and really the big bottleneck is
02:24:30.120 deciding if we're going to have a
02:24:31.279 videographer with us all the time or
02:24:32.920 like hire someone on a project for
02:24:34.920 project basis where do you think works
02:24:37.279 better out of the two um honestly I
02:24:40.319 think he just needs a videographer that
02:24:41.720 he likes a lot I got Sam laska there
02:24:44.680 that's right and know he's with me all
02:24:47.279 the time yeah it's it's been the most
02:24:50.040 difficult part like we've been searing
02:24:51.240 for a videographer for like I mean
02:24:53.279 basically years at this point yeah
02:24:55.920 probably
02:24:57.479 year it's not that hard of a roll feels
02:24:59.840 like feels like new yeah but um but yeah
02:25:02.520 it's it's cuz all them they just they
02:25:04.000 end up dropping off really really
02:25:05.359 quickly I don't know they just they they
02:25:08.160 don't like maybe it's a culture fit
02:25:10.479 thing could be that but like it's been
02:25:12.359 really difficult to find all the roles
02:25:14.760 for sure someone who's going to stick
02:25:16.200 with us travel with us who made you
02:25:18.279 want I feel like anyone in this room
02:25:20.439 would want to do
02:25:22.319 it said there's so much value just being
02:25:25.720 with Alex every day they'll be people in
02:25:28.560 your audience but does he not want
02:25:30.640 someone following him with a camera no
02:25:32.560 no I mean we we definitely would prefer
02:25:34.720 that no but him it's him who yeah he he
02:25:38.640 wants someone following us but like it's
02:25:41.000 it would be Thomas but like Thomas isn't
02:25:43.120 he he's not a videographer like he's
02:25:45.080 he's a he's a different role entirely so
02:25:48.200 he wants someone to follow on he wants
02:25:49.640 someone who like can like have good ban
02:25:51.800 or will push him sometimes like someone
02:25:53.720 who's like a friend gang yeah has you
02:25:56.680 made a post about it oh yeah we make we
02:25:59.000 do do hiring post basically every single
02:26:00.520 month why doesn't he just learn how to
02:26:01.920 use a
02:26:03.479 camera oh that that's actually what I
02:26:05.960 used to do at won't point so why the
02:26:07.520 [ __ ] you don't you pull out a camera I
02:26:10.399 could yeah yeah you're already friends
02:26:14.520 if that's the element and you know how
02:26:16.359 to use a camera I mean
02:26:18.040 [ __ ] you I mean the only thing that's
02:26:21.439 I'm still like thrown off by is like
02:26:22.960 zillions of people have come in and I'll
02:26:24.439 bet you that many of the people who've
02:26:26.000 applied would have been a fit so I just
02:26:27.880 it might just be a weird hiring process
02:26:29.479 you guys have I mean when we when we run
02:26:31.720 our things actually how did you come in
02:26:34.160 I applied for Leela's
02:26:36.399 videographer and I was like you're with
02:26:38.399 me yeah um yeah should he had Jason I
02:26:42.359 agree on the feeling P though if
02:26:43.600 someone's going to be following you
02:26:44.680 around all the time like the vibe is
02:26:47.439 more important than the skill yeah than
02:26:49.479 anything the skill is not the thing it's
02:26:51.800 just the like Vibe of having them with
02:26:53.520 you all the time Daniel asked me on the
02:26:55.680 last question in the interview he was
02:26:57.240 like well what's what's like cuz I was
02:26:59.479 telling him I was like listen I'm going
02:27:00.680 to be like hey we're going to do this
02:27:02.319 big thing and you're going to set up and
02:27:03.479 then I'm going be like nah just kidding
02:27:05.240 and it's going to happen all the time
02:27:06.479 and then
02:27:07.439 also uh like you're going to have plans
02:27:09.840 and then you're going to have to cancel
02:27:10.680 them last minute cuz we go late and like
02:27:12.800 basically it's just going to be chaos
02:27:14.840 and I can be in a bad mood and I can be
02:27:16.640 tough sometimes and I just like painted
02:27:18.800 that picture he was like God it I'm here
02:27:20.800 for it but um he's like what do you like
02:27:24.840 I'm really experienced I think you were
02:27:26.399 like I'm a really high caliber
02:27:28.200 videographer what do you need a
02:27:29.200 professional for yeah what do you need a
02:27:30.880 professional for is what he asked me and
02:27:32.240 he's like what's the most important
02:27:33.439 thing for you to me and I was like like

02:28:16.000 for me I honestly like I am I am
02:28:18.960 grateful that Daniel has a skill that he
02:28:20.479 has and can like edit bangers and do all
02:28:22.439 sorts of like he's a weapon he can do
02:28:23.800 lots of things but like for me if his
02:28:26.600 skill was half of what it was but but I
02:28:30.080 like him as much as I like him that
02:28:31.880 would have been enough this is just like
02:28:33.319 your skills are just bonus for me um but
02:28:35.840 it was just like we have such a sick
02:28:37.720 Vibe on the on the media team I think we
02:28:39.640 have a sweet like the team's awesome um
02:28:42.200 and so like I've had a videographer in
02:28:45.080 the past that I and nothing wrong with
02:28:46.920 the guy I just like wasn't I didn't like
02:28:48.359 look forward to you know what I mean it
02:28:49.680 was just like work like okay sit down
02:28:51.520 and like every Court stop and it came
02:28:53.160 out in the came out in the footage and
02:28:55.319 so like I have to look forward to there
02:28:58.880 should feel I should feel no friction or
02:29:00.359 no hesitation to having Daniel around
02:29:02.600 like I'm not worried if he's around if
02:29:03.760 I'm saying I don't have to edit myself
02:29:05.880 um and like that is number one you've
02:29:09.200 got he's got to like me and I've got to
02:29:11.840 because it's both it's both ways cuz he
02:29:13.840 like if you don't like someone you can
02:29:15.319 capture it very differently like on some
02:29:17.680 level like you can make someone look
02:29:19.080 very different if you don't like like
02:29:20.319 them and um and so it has to be both
02:29:23.120 directions like both people have to have
02:29:24.840 to get along with each
02:29:26.840 other that that's probably something we
02:29:28.760 ever really looked at we cuz sometimes
02:29:31.279 we want like really really nice stuff
02:29:33.120 it's like mov level you know with the SC
02:29:35.920 motion shots and whatnot and obviously
02:29:38.319 when we look at the application I
02:29:40.520 prioritize liking a person and the thing
02:29:42.800 is is like I bet you if there was
02:29:44.160 something that we're like hey can you
02:29:45.160 learn Adobe something you'd be like sure
02:29:48.600 I like it'll take me a couple weeks but
02:29:49.840 I'll figure it out and like if you have
02:29:51.920 that type of person it's like I just
02:29:53.439 it's so much harder to find someone you
02:29:54.960 like than it is to find someone who has
02:29:57.000 the base skill at least in my opinion
02:29:59.240 with this
02:30:01.760 role so I would just I would prioritize
02:30:04.160 someone that Justin likes and then
02:30:06.279 that's it and then from there like the
02:30:08.520 other skills I remember where you
02:30:10.160 mentioned this I was watching some of
02:30:11.319 your content you said you been kind of
02:30:13.040 made a system for how when someone was
02:30:14.560 filming you they're nodding they're
02:30:16.359 bringing you your nicotine and all that
02:30:17.640 kind of stuff y so y all the I mean
02:30:21.680 Daniel's always got Nicorette caffeine
02:30:24.640 water Gatorade he's got he's a full full
02:30:28.279 full service um at all times he's always
02:30:31.720 ready I was putting that up there yeah
02:30:34.080 yeah no it's super awful and like after
02:30:36.200 every every recording session it's kind
02:30:37.600 of like on a foul shot for basketball
02:30:39.600 like everyone everyone pounds afterwards
02:30:42.000 like it's just like we always do that
02:30:43.880 like w like you guys can't see it cuz
02:30:46.120 you guys are looking at me but I can see
02:30:47.560 them and like they're nodding the whole
02:30:49.560 time while were're filming because they
02:30:51.120 know that that cuz when we thought
02:30:53.800 activities right what are the things cuz
02:30:56.200 so Caleb who runs the whole team he was
02:30:58.359 obviously Higher One and so he had the
02:31:00.120 camera first and um that was the first
02:31:02.520 time I had a vrf that I really liked and
02:31:04.040 I was like oh man like Caleb's cool as
02:31:05.720 [ __ ] like this like this feels this
02:31:07.359 isn't this is easy right and I was like
02:31:10.040 what makes it and then so then Caleb
02:31:12.000 obviously moved up and then he stopped
02:31:13.160 being at the filming session so we had
02:31:14.680 you know two or three guys there at the
02:31:15.960 filming sessions and I was like man this
02:31:17.200 feels heavy like what's like why does
02:31:18.479 this feel different and so then we had
02:31:20.240 to backtrack and be like what what does
02:31:22.760 he do that is different than what other
02:31:25.840 people do other people were like the
02:31:27.080 vibe is like Vibe [ __ ] I don't care what
02:31:29.560 does he do and what he did was he would
02:31:32.359 nod while I was while I was going and
02:31:35.479 after every filming thing he was like
02:31:36.920 that was [ __ ] awesome like sick that
02:31:38.600 was so dope and then he also listened
02:31:40.640 and he had really engaging questions
02:31:43.319 that he'd be like so how does that
02:31:45.560 relate to this or how does that so the
02:31:47.359 followup questions were great and they
02:31:48.600 could slice that up and that made for
02:31:50.160 really good content because the the
02:31:51.520 questions he had was questions that the
02:31:52.800 audience had and so it's just looking at
02:31:56.160 like what are all the little micro
02:31:57.560 things and then you make that into a
02:31:58.840 checklist and that's why I think most
02:31:59.920 people can't teach anything is because
02:32:01.200 they don't get it down to like what are
02:32:02.200 the
02:32:04.279 behaviors and so now the team I mean the
02:32:06.399 whole team knows that when they film
02:32:07.640 it's like a whole
02:32:08.840 thing did you like buy out a bunch of
02:32:11.160 people or like no we do so we so I'll
02:32:13.800 tell you the quick process and then
02:32:14.880 we'll we'll move to a different topic
02:32:16.399 but um we do the big application gave a
02:32:19.560 big raw file told everybody they had 48
02:32:21.880 hours to submit uh the raw for that way
02:32:25.319 everybody's work off the same thing cuz
02:32:26.960 if everybody can just pull from whatever
02:32:28.319 then the quality of the content is going
02:32:29.640 to be a huge Factor whereas if everyone
02:32:31.240 pulls from the same raw the quality of
02:32:32.680 the editor is going to be the thing that
02:32:34.160 shines through and so um this is from
02:32:37.240 the editing perspective if we're doing
02:32:38.640 videographers then yeah it's going to be
02:32:40.000 way more about Vibe like in terms of our
02:32:42.200 our Dynamic um but for editing uh then
02:32:46.840 they would submit and so from 1,200 we
02:32:48.520 got 60 subm just to give you Ana like 5%
02:32:51.319 of people actually submitted Riley did
02:32:53.000 you come from from one of our contests
02:32:55.359 uh no I was reached out to but it was
02:32:57.080 pretty similar process like applied gave
02:32:59.279 me W file edited yeah and so then they
02:33:02.120 turn it in and then um you know Caleb
02:33:04.840 would look at all of them and be like
02:33:06.520 these three guys are sick and then
02:33:08.000 they'll interview those guys and then
02:33:10.680 however many of them are cool we
02:33:14.600 out that's fundamentally how we do it
02:33:17.439 like we test for skill for editing we
02:33:19.080 test for skill and then we test for Vibe
02:33:20.600 because it's way easier to go like from
02:33:22.040 1,200 down to a much smaller with from
02:33:25.040 skill um from a Vibe
02:33:27.960 perspective um what was the process for
02:33:30.120 you for videographer stuff I did like
02:33:32.319 four
02:33:33.800 interviews actually five
02:33:35.840 interviews um one with Caleb two with
02:33:38.399 Frank and then one with you and then one
02:33:40.439 with you was intense I was like this is
02:33:41.680 a test everything's test you had like
02:33:44.040 one really tall chair and one small
02:33:45.240 chair is's like pick one I was like I'm
02:33:47.120 s a small
02:33:48.160 chair hilarious
02:33:50.600 that wasn't a
02:33:54.240 test yeah yeah that's funny um so yeah
02:33:58.080 hopefully that give you a little bit
02:33:59.000 Insight yeah the
02:34:00.479 sure yeah it's really all about the
02:34:02.560 chair sizes this is what matters yeah
02:34:05.359 but Al like I needed somebody who wasn't
02:34:06.720 going to be trying to compete with me
02:34:08.120 you know what I mean um I just like I
02:34:09.920 don't I didn't want that energy I wanted
02:34:11.240 somebody who's like super laidback and
02:34:13.359 Daniel's as laidback as they get when
02:34:15.040 you didn't did gym launch you said that
02:34:17.200 you don't do emails like you didn't do
02:34:19.279 emails
02:34:20.479 how did you nurture your clients
02:34:24.000 then or like kept in contact with them
02:34:27.359 um you mean leads yeah I just got more
02:34:30.399 of them okay I'm being dead serious like
02:34:33.200 I mean like there were there many things
02:34:34.600 I probably should have done I just every
02:34:36.840 time someone's like do you want to start
02:34:37.920 emailing I was like h no and I didn't
02:34:40.960 want to give it to somebody else until
02:34:42.120 eventually they were like can we please
02:34:43.720 hire someone to just do this and I just
02:34:45.399 didn't look at
02:34:46.720 it I'm just I'm so particular with
02:34:49.200 written withu written word it's the it's
02:34:51.279 my primary way of communicating it's
02:34:52.840 like my like people despite the fact
02:34:54.680 that everyone on the internet sees me on
02:34:55.960 video like my books are better in my
02:34:58.240 opinion than anything I create but it's
02:34:59.800 also because I spend more time on them
02:35:01.040 than anything else and so when I see
02:35:03.200 someone write I'm like this makes no
02:35:04.800 sense this is completely unclear why do
02:35:06.720 like why do you
02:35:08.520 exist yeah but also I think I kind of
02:35:11.680 understand your question a bit and I'm
02:35:13.000 kind of like horos in this way is if
02:35:15.319 you've got something that working if
02:35:16.840 you've got something that's working that
02:35:18.000 isn't email and you can just keep
02:35:20.920 increasing the volume of what you're
02:35:22.640 doing then who cares and that was it we
02:35:25.399 just kept spending more money kept
02:35:26.600 making more money so I was like I could
02:35:28.040 do that or I could make more ads and
02:35:31.640 Crush yeah I mean honestly I think Sam
02:35:34.080 and I are so aligned with this which is
02:35:36.120 just like find something that works do
02:35:38.760 it as much of it as you possibly can and
02:35:40.600 eliminate everything else in real life
02:35:41.880 that's not that and that also includes
02:35:44.600 all your personal life
02:35:46.000 stuff like like this was a theme of the
02:35:49.160 whole last talk if you guys all heard it
02:35:50.600 we talked for like an hour maybe more on
02:35:53.160 this one topic of like everything that
02:35:54.960 you have like cooking cleaning laundry
02:35:58.279 getting your car filled up with gas like
02:36:00.439 all of this stuff if you know that you
02:36:02.720 can make more money with your time than
02:36:04.319 it than it cost you to get someone else
02:36:06.760 to do that then you should do that and
02:36:09.680 then you'll be amazed at how much extra
02:36:11.160 time you have if you're cleaning your
02:36:13.319 house or preparing your meals that's
02:36:15.520 going to be the best thing you learn
02:36:16.760 from this event is to to get someone
02:36:19.359 else to do that cleaning and meal prep
02:36:22.560 and groceries is like the lowest hanging
02:36:24.640 fruit so I calculated this ship on based
02:36:27.200 on us averages so just the big three
02:36:29.600 which is laundry cleaning and food
02:36:31.439 related those together are 96 hours a
02:36:33.840 month on average it's like I just found
02:36:36.439 you two and a half full work weeks of
02:36:39.160 time but and also that doesn't include
02:36:41.279 switching costs of like the cost of time
02:36:43.640 of like cleaning up like cleaning up
02:36:45.279 after you eat and well thinking about
02:36:47.279 when you're going to do it and what
02:36:48.359 you're going to eat and groceries and
02:36:49.840 what you're going to buy and putting
02:36:51.520 them back in the shelves and taking the
02:36:53.080 bags like all that [ __ ] I really want
02:36:55.399 like emphasize like the whole like
02:36:56.800 personal chef like housekeeper stuff
02:36:58.560 like I haven't been a coach for long my
02:37:00.560 first 6K pay in full I got like an
02:37:02.399 in-house Health team which is like a
02:37:03.720 housekeeper a chef and like a dietician
02:37:05.359 and stuff it's crazy but they're not
02:37:06.920 that expensive like I pay my I had a
02:37:08.680 maid and I pay her 150 bucks twice a
02:37:10.279 week to come over and I have a meal plan
02:37:11.800 I give it to her and she shops for the
02:37:13.399 food it's all Whole Foods they come over
02:37:15.520 they make it I have like 20 meals in my
02:37:17.080 fridge at all times they're like amazing
02:37:19.080 good like like Latino whipped up food
02:37:20.760 it's great and uh I was able to take
02:37:23.960 like three more sales calls a day and
02:37:25.439 that's a big reason why I Haven won the
02:37:26.399 school games like that was huge and you
02:37:29.160 also feel amazing about it it's like it
02:37:30.760 was like it seemed like it's like super
02:37:32.319 luxury investment like oh shark has a
02:37:33.760 private chef but it was it's 1,500 bucks
02:37:35.319 a month like if you do the math it's 96
02:37:38.439 hours it is $1,500 a month that's
02:37:40.160 literally like I have a big presentation
02:37:41.720 on it it's $15 and like 16 cents per
02:37:44.840 hour if you can make more than
02:37:47.040 $156 per hour with your time you should
02:37:50.240 do that it has nothing to do with luxury
02:37:52.279 it has everything to do with like what
02:37:53.600 is my return on time and like you can
02:37:55.880 just ignore every poor person who says
02:37:57.960 otherwise this is kind of for both of
02:38:00.920 you probably you Sam as well definitely
02:38:02.520 Sam um but I guess like when you're
02:38:04.000 building you know a startup um obviously
02:38:08.200 you know you might have sometimes you
02:38:09.479 might have a little bit lack of capital
02:38:10.640 A little lack of resources I guess how
02:38:12.520 do you get a players to work for you and
02:38:16.560 with you and how do you like structure
02:38:18.680 comp structures and all that so it like
02:38:21.080 you know go for it when you don't have
02:38:23.560 any money no no no no not we no no no
02:38:27.760 you maybe you're trying to get somebody
02:38:29.160 who's you know making decent money you
02:38:32.640 know already or you're wanting to get
02:38:34.439 you know we're making money but like you
02:38:36.399 want to get an a player team um but
02:38:39.640 you're still a startup you're not you
02:38:42.399 know yeah well it's really
02:38:46.000 hard it will probably take a long time
02:38:50.000 you'll probably want to
02:38:52.520 quit but but eventually like something
02:38:57.080 you'll just there'll be a chemistry I
02:38:59.160 think and a perfect fit with someone and
02:39:02.000 you just kind of have to give it enough
02:39:04.200 time until that thing happens and it and
02:39:07.040 you also have to offer something unusual
02:39:09.439 like for me it was offering the like
02:39:11.880 co-founder title to Daniel cuz I knew
02:39:15.200 when I found him that that was what I
02:39:18.040 needed to use
02:39:19.960 so programmer yeah might yeah
02:39:25.800 um and you know when I found him it was
02:39:28.200 like the perfect balance because he just
02:39:31.200 wanted to code he said I love to code I
02:39:33.560 can build anything all I need is someone
02:39:35.560 who can
02:39:37.080 dream and he was like if we've if you've
02:39:39.399 got some like money and you know what to
02:39:41.240 build and you can help us get customers
02:39:43.760 and and well I needed it was code like
02:39:46.200 then we're good and we we had like a
02:39:49.439 good chemistry how did yall meet if you
02:39:51.160 don't mind me asking I did 600
02:39:54.319 interviews did you have a like a a hedg
02:39:56.920 hunter so all I did for a year how did
02:39:59.760 you find how did you get the interviews
02:40:00.920 did you work with like a I worked with
02:40:02.200 many different recruiters hacking
02:40:04.720 news like I tried honestly bit of
02:40:08.080 everything plus I had to hire five of
02:40:10.439 the wrong people too so it's not like I
02:40:12.279 just got it right like it was the most
02:40:15.120 brutal thing I ever did do you do you
02:40:17.359 have like I I hear people talking about
02:40:19.000 doing more interviews do you feel like
02:40:20.560 there's ever like a sense of uncertainty
02:40:22.439 like after you get to a certain point
02:40:23.479 you're like damn option number one two
02:40:25.520 and three are good or whatever like what
02:40:26.760 do you
02:40:28.479 think yeah like some people I swore were
02:40:31.720 great and they weren't at all
02:40:35.479 and I'm sure some people were great and
02:40:37.960 I didn't see it and I missed them but
02:40:39.319 how can I know about those um but in the
02:40:42.399 end like Daniel my co-founder he was
02:40:45.880 like there was chemistry and I think I
02:40:48.479 didn't I ignored
02:40:49.880 I was too logical back then but I think
02:40:53.920 I've come to realize now that the
02:40:55.240 chemistry is really important and I pay
02:40:57.760 way more attention to that now
02:40:59.760 ultimately you're not going to know
02:41:00.960 until you hire them right
02:41:03.840 but you just have to talk to a lot of
02:41:06.200 people
02:41:07.479 too I feel like there's there's been
02:41:09.720 this case where I feel like everybody
02:41:12.279 wants to be an entrepreneur you know so
02:41:14.800 like when I'm trying to you know hire
02:41:16.640 people it's almost like they ra they're
02:41:18.840 like i' rather do that myself or rather
02:41:20.960 do what kind of person uh just you know
02:41:23.680 uh I guess like high level people for a
02:41:25.040 growth partner agency so like somebody
02:41:26.319 who can like be a growth partner
02:41:28.399 essentially or be a you know I think I
02:41:31.319 think me and Chris's problem is we're
02:41:32.600 unicorns and and we provide our people
02:41:34.720 with like we cover all the bases so we
02:41:36.439 need more people like us yeah and then
02:41:39.279 yeah so we even we've even talked to
02:41:40.720 some people that we know aren't
02:41:44.240 making you know that much money and like
02:41:47.000 hey man I'll pay you triple what you're
02:41:49.000 making right now you know I'm like
02:41:50.520 managing School
02:41:51.760 communities and they're like I'd rather
02:41:53.560 do my own thing and it's just like wait
02:41:55.319 what you know what I mean it's like a
02:41:56.640 disconnect I think sometimes so I don't
02:41:58.800 know like it's like I can't yeah the
02:42:00.640 money is not the thing right right
02:42:02.840 absolutely cuz you know when with us
02:42:05.120 we're like competing with Google NASA
02:42:07.640 SpaceX Tesla so everyone's trying to
02:42:09.840 throw money at them MH and they show us
02:42:12.800 their DMS on LinkedIn and stuff it's
02:42:14.479 insane like the amount of recruiters
02:42:16.439 right um so money can't do it
02:42:19.680 like it has to be something
02:42:22.399 else
02:42:23.920 right in your case do you think it's
02:42:25.880 like the
02:42:27.439 environment well what when I got my
02:42:29.399 co-founder or when we get people now
02:42:31.040 like everybody well the hardest one is
02:42:33.960 getting the co-founder in the beginning
02:42:35.760 because you don't have anything so right
02:42:38.720 that's the hard one but with time now
02:42:41.279 the way we get it is through internal
02:42:43.040 referrals so if we have great people and
02:42:45.760 they've worked at places like coin most
02:42:47.960 of our talent comes from
02:42:49.680 coinbase and riot games because we've
02:42:53.080 got some of their best engineers and
02:42:54.960 they know everyone and when they tell
02:42:57.560 they're like hey how you going over Riot
02:42:59.439 or coin or okay burn out dude this place
02:43:02.920 is badass where I am and they trust that
02:43:06.120 person because that person isn't a
02:43:07.920 recruiter they're the probably the best
02:43:09.960 software engineer these other people
02:43:11.240 have worked with and so the word means a
02:43:13.880 lot what about people like that aren't
02:43:15.880 cerss though like what about like you
02:43:17.240 know Andrew or like Matt you know oh
02:43:20.120 that that's a different side of the
02:43:21.800 business so that comes from your
02:43:24.439 customers so Matthew who's running our
02:43:27.319 podcast he came from the community and
02:43:29.800 like he
02:43:31.520 showed he was making podcast episodes
02:43:34.160 for
02:43:35.240 free and then he flew to the first
02:43:37.720 school games he paid for it himself he's
02:43:40.640 from
02:43:41.560 Ireland like who on
02:43:45.479 indeed is going to do that
02:43:50.279 I don't know if you've ever tried indeed
02:43:51.680 it's so bad but yeah but you look from
02:43:55.520 them within I think like Kirby was in my
02:43:58.840 Mastermind and then he made this free
02:44:00.520 community called synthesizers he was one
02:44:03.080 of he was on the leader boards for
02:44:04.319 school
02:44:05.200 Community right so's like okay he's
02:44:08.680 committed then Kirby hired wictor
02:44:11.120 where's
02:44:12.000 wictor there he is because he was his
02:44:15.040 most engaged member in synthesizers so
02:44:18.080 you see and then wcta hired this guy
02:44:21.200 called
02:44:21.920 Nas cuz he was someone who connected
02:44:25.439 with him on school too and now Nas is
02:44:27.640 referring someone I love it yeah I think
02:44:30.080 that's what we're hoping for right like
02:44:31.479 whenever you're like don't like with
02:44:33.040 that being said we don't have the best
02:44:34.680 people in the world but we're we're kind
02:44:36.160 of rooting through internal it starts
02:44:38.200 with one yeah but if you don't get that
02:44:40.720 one you'll never get anyone else we have
02:44:42.800 a few good really good people I'd say
02:44:44.479 but yeah have you pushed them for
02:44:46.600 referrals um yeah but I think I think
02:44:49.120 the big thing is get getting the high
02:44:50.800 level people so we have really good like
02:44:53.960 um executors not really good leaders
02:44:57.359 that's one thing that we we have like
02:44:58.680 I'm I'm literally I'm managing like I
02:45:01.240 feel like I have to run like five
02:45:02.399 meetings a day almost you know for our
02:45:05.000 team so it's just like excessive it's a
02:45:07.040 lot yeah it's excessive so I would
02:45:09.319 challenge the structure
02:45:12.279 then the vision for the business has to
02:45:14.560 be big enough that smart people can fit
02:45:16.240 their dreams inside of it and so if you
02:45:18.479 want break
02:45:19.640 then you need people who like they need
02:45:22.279 to be able to believe that their dreams
02:45:23.960 can come true within your vision if it's
02:45:25.960 again if it's like yeah we've just got a
02:45:27.760 couple groups that we're running and
02:45:28.760 we're making money then it's like that
02:45:30.960 doesn't like really get me motivated if
02:45:32.960 I'm intelligent I'm CU like the best
02:45:34.680 people have there's no lack of
02:45:36.160 opportunity for the best people they
02:45:37.800 have tons like you have to think about
02:45:39.439 this is It's a totally different game
02:45:41.359 like you're if you're accustomed to
02:45:42.520 taking people who like I really want a
02:45:43.880 job all of those people are irrelevant
02:45:46.479 you have to be people who are like in
02:45:48.359 some ways you're competing for them so
02:45:50.359 the more you're competing for a prospect
02:45:52.080 like selling them and so if you feel
02:45:54.040 like like I'll tell you the funny one is
02:45:55.800 like if you're interviewing people where
02:45:58.080 you're like sell me on why I should take
02:45:59.680 you if you say that to somebody who's
02:46:01.760 actually really talented they'll be like
02:46:03.680 I'm good
02:46:06.600 like they just like they just don't like
02:46:09.479 I you have to respond to this offer
02:46:11.000 within 12 hours it's like okay well I
02:46:14.640 think you hit the nail right there for
02:46:15.800 me like their Vision has to be our
02:46:17.240 vision needs to be big enough for their
02:46:18.479 dreams to you have to be able to say
02:46:20.120 like what we want to do is we want to
02:46:21.520 make music money into the standard for
02:46:24.120 this and then they have to believe with
02:46:25.840 a decent amount of certainty that it's
02:46:27.359 possible and so like how you guys
02:46:29.640 present like you are absolutely selling
02:46:31.960 them and so like I think Drew this about
02:46:34.040 on on a past one but everybody here
02:46:36.840 understands you know lead generation
02:46:38.960 lead nurture sales onboarding and then
02:46:42.880 you know retention Ascension right
02:46:44.520 that's the how you do with customers
02:46:46.160 right this is the exact same process for
02:46:48.399 an employer you generate applications
02:46:50.439 you nurture applications the sale is the
02:46:52.560 interview you onboard the employee and
02:46:55.120 then either retain them or Ascend them
02:46:57.640 it's the same thing and so you basically
02:46:59.200 have to understand the acquis like this
02:47:00.680 is when we get into scaling because
02:47:01.840 everyone's like two or three people are
02:47:03.319 like what's scaling is it's just where
02:47:05.319 the inflow of talent into the business
02:47:06.920 matches the inflow of customers into the
02:47:09.479 business and you have to have an
02:47:11.200 exceptional conversion process for
02:47:12.600 attracting Talent this is where brand
02:47:14.640 counts double it counts once on the
02:47:17.319 front end for customers and again on the
02:47:19.240 back end for talent and it becomes
02:47:20.680 either a virtuous cycle or a vicious
02:47:22.479 cycle either destroys your business you
02:47:24.439 have a bad brand because what do you
02:47:26.640 think what like what um like great
02:47:28.760 talent will look at your reviews and be
02:47:31.359 like oh yeah never mind they would work
02:47:34.279 at a good place so I guess and last
02:47:36.880 question I guess what what would be the
02:47:38.319 best way to like acquire Talent is it
02:47:40.160 just building a personal brand like in
02:47:42.640 our field of work cuz I don't think it's
02:47:44.560 necessarily like I can't I don't feel
02:47:46.560 like I can find the right people on
02:47:47.760 LinkedIn or something like that you know
02:47:49.319 for what we're trying to do it needs to
02:47:50.640 be people who are kind of like already
02:47:52.600 kind of entrepreneurs or people who are
02:47:54.040 in more of like the sales or manager
02:47:56.319 manager field it really depends on what
02:47:57.880 role you're looking for but I can
02:47:59.319 promise you that very smart people are
02:48:00.720 on LinkedIn do you know how I
02:48:05.080 um I I looked I got invited to speak at
02:48:07.800 something and I looked at who else was
02:48:09.359 speaking there and I saw hor mosy was
02:48:10.640 speaking there and I was all right
02:48:13.279 there's my
02:48:14.600 opportunity that the first time we met
02:48:16.359 in person yeah honestly so cool was
02:48:19.760 that one year before I spoke about doing
02:48:22.920 a deal but you have to like be strategic
02:48:27.560 sometimes
02:48:29.920 yeah and then so you have to kind of do
02:48:32.600 this old school networking thing which I
02:48:34.359 [ __ ] hate
02:48:35.880 because it's like the only time I've
02:48:37.840 ever done that the deal is like the one
02:48:41.200 deal to never do that again um but yeah
02:48:46.279 you kind of have to do that I had to
02:48:48.080 start going to like these software
02:48:50.000 things I had to start to meet some
02:48:52.439 software Engineers I had to learn about
02:48:54.960 their world I had to ask people about
02:48:57.439 why does what do you hate as a software
02:49:00.120 engineer what do you like what makes a
02:49:01.560 good company what makes a Bad Company
02:49:03.359 you have to like learn everything about
02:49:06.520 it and network and do that it it really
02:49:10.240 sucks honestly but if you're serious
02:49:12.080 about it I knew there was no way I could
02:49:13.760 build school without this person so I
02:49:15.920 delayed starting it by a year just to
02:49:19.439 find the
02:49:20.720 person yeah so I was like I'm not even
02:49:22.920 going to start until I find them like
02:49:25.520 that's how essential I knew they will
02:49:27.720 that's why I tell everyone to not do
02:49:29.600 software it's just because the scale of
02:49:31.800 how difficult it is to actually do a
02:49:33.239 right is so hard that
02:49:35.439 like no one basically no one does it
02:49:37.800 right even when you know even if you
02:49:39.600 know what you're doing most people can't
02:49:40.880 do it and most people who are quot in
02:49:42.920 the info world are like oh my info thing
02:49:45.040 is INS sellable so I'm going to build
02:49:46.600 software and they just think that like
02:49:48.040 white labeling high level means they had
02:49:49.520 a software company um
02:49:52.279 like but I mean right and or they create
02:49:55.640 some widget that someone else can
02:49:57.040 duplicate in 5 seconds that they did off
02:49:59.319 with an offshore developer that like if
02:50:01.560 it actually did work then that developer
02:50:03.040 would hold you Ransom and then what like
02:50:04.520 they just don't play it out two steps
02:50:06.600 and the code [ __ ] anyways and it's all
02:50:08.600 it all sucks like yeah don't do it yeah
02:50:12.840 and someone were like you're just you
02:50:14.000 don't want us to succeed that's why cuz
02:50:15.560 you're you're doing so I was like no man
02:50:17.080 I saw that Sam put five years in I was
02:50:19.279 like great okay I saw the metrics I was
02:50:21.439 like okay this is legit I spent all my
02:50:23.239 money and it still wasn't enough
02:50:25.920 yeah I had to spend like twice that
02:50:29.359 again yeah thank you guys for that too
02:50:31.760 by the way that that's going to help a
02:50:32.880 lot I apprciate this for real yeah I
02:50:35.520 mean the personal brand thing is just
02:50:36.640 good for recr like if you have one it's
02:50:38.359 great it helps a lot um but at the end
02:50:41.120 of the day if the if the if the business
02:50:42.680 that you're trying to build solves a
02:50:44.399 real problem and you really genuinely
02:50:46.439 care about the problem if you find
02:50:48.120 someone else who also cares about that
02:50:49.720 problem they will be more likely to work
02:50:51.200 with you like that's fundamentally
02:50:53.080 it what are you sorry last question fun
02:50:57.399 what do you think about creating a an
02:51:00.160 offer to train people to do what you are
02:51:03.680 trying to eventually staff for like how
02:51:06.920 I'm growing yeah like you know like in
02:51:09.880 training there was a point there was a
02:51:10.880 point in time I had a closer program I
02:51:12.200 was training closers and I was Staffing
02:51:13.439 them you know what I mean and then I was
02:51:14.720 I stopped doing that cuz there's so many
02:51:15.800 closer training programs but right now I
02:51:17.399 really need grow Partners people who can
02:51:19.680 lead and manage our clients and kind of
02:51:21.960 oversee everything what do you think
02:51:24.080 about like I know there's a growth
02:51:25.880 operator thing but they're not you know
02:51:27.439 like in my mind like they don't have all
02:51:29.239 the skill sets necessarily what if
02:51:30.279 someone you know created a program to
02:51:32.600 train people I don't think you create
02:51:33.880 another business of software role okay
02:51:36.479 depends if it's like I know with a
02:51:37.880 software
02:51:39.920 engineer no one's going to be any decent
02:51:42.800 in 10 years maybe a prodigy in six or
02:51:45.439 seven but like there's just no
02:51:47.960 shortcutting it like I mean my
02:51:51.319 co-founder's done 20 so the years matter
02:51:55.800 and the same is true with a lot of
02:51:57.960 things like there's just years so like
02:52:00.840 but some other things might be different
02:52:02.399 like setting okay yeah you can teach
02:52:04.160 that closing yeah you can probably teach
02:52:06.560 that but these more high level strategic
02:52:11.560 things yeah that ain't happening like it
02:52:14.439 took me [ __ ] 10 years like so are you
02:52:17.800 going to wait 10 years
02:52:19.080 is no yeah it's it's like fundamentally
02:52:21.880 every skill is trainable the question is
02:52:23.359 whether it's worth the return on effort
02:52:24.720 and the resources to train someone with
02:52:26.279 it if you break things down enough you
02:52:28.239 can train someone to do anything it's
02:52:30.160 just that if someone lacks has zero meta
02:52:32.640 skills they don't know how to read they
02:52:34.200 don't know how to write they know how to
02:52:35.640 talk you could teach someone to do all
02:52:36.960 that stuff it's just why
02:52:40.120 bother so I'd rather take someone who's
02:52:42.200 already here and then just nudge them if
02:52:44.040 I can with you know proper training that
02:52:45.760 just Bridges the gap between all the
02:52:47.080 skills they come in with and then
02:52:48.520 applying that to my business you got
02:52:51.239 it cool appreciate it yeah always I mean
02:52:54.880 the people is the reason that most
02:52:56.120 internet marketers in general can't make
02:52:58.000 money I'm sorry they they make money but
02:53:00.239 they don't make like big money is that
02:53:02.000 they just can't they can't they don't
02:53:03.239 know how to operate people and that's
02:53:05.600 usually because they need like a right
02:53:07.279 hand a true right hand who can who's as
02:53:09.520 good as
02:53:10.640 them and like Lea will never get the
02:53:12.920 credit that she deserves and that's fine
02:53:15.160 um but like the reason that all of our
02:53:17.640 stuff is so big is because she's so good
02:53:21.000 at at building like she's an
02:53:23.680 unbelievable Builder and so like the
02:53:26.160 culture of the team is Rock Solid I mean
02:53:27.680 the guys will tell you like Lila really
02:53:29.200 runs the like Ila runs acquisition.
02:53:31.239 comom like I I really like she really
02:53:34.040 does she does like Lea runs everything
02:53:36.960 like I I mean I told you I have an empty
02:53:39.000 calendar I can't have an empty calendar
02:53:41.359 and and also have a business that's
02:53:42.880 running unless someone else is actually
02:53:44.200 doing it Lela takes 15 meetings a day
02:53:47.279 she operates she's she she's
02:53:48.520 coordinating things between different
02:53:49.600 departments she's checking on portfolio
02:53:51.399 company she's having you know one once
02:53:53.760 of people who having some sort of
02:53:55.000 emotional breakdown about some craziness
02:53:57.160 whatever um she handles all that with a
02:54:01.000 smile you know what I mean and so but
02:54:02.800 like I I I was we were talking earlier
02:54:05.720 like I capped at $3 million a year and
02:54:08.120 then when Lela came in 24 months later I
02:54:09.720 took home 17 million in income
02:54:12.000 net and so the difference was that she
02:54:14.840 liked people and I tried to avoid
02:54:18.840 them and that was the problem and so she
02:54:22.800 her like Lea's genuine Vision in life is
02:54:25.840 to build a company that people love
02:54:27.479 working at that's her whole like the
02:54:29.479 whole reason that she like she gets up
02:54:31.120 like her internal mission is to build a
02:54:32.680 company that people love being at every
02:54:35.680 day and so her vision just fits within
02:54:38.720 my vision and so I recruited her to do
02:54:42.200 it but like if we didn't do stuff that
02:54:43.359 she liked we'd like she wouldn't build
02:54:44.960 it so I very much like especially the
02:54:48.479 more talented the people that you bring
02:54:49.600 on the more you like like they don't
02:54:52.120 need pushing like they know what they're
02:54:55.040 doing you just need to make sure that
02:54:57.040 they're doing it in the direction and
02:54:58.720 you kind of do this yeah the amount of
02:55:00.760 training that you have to give someone
02:55:02.439 is inversely proportional to the skills
02:55:03.920 that they come in with so the more spe
02:55:06.040 basically the the less skilled the
02:55:07.399 person the more specific the
02:55:09.279 instructions so like Sam could basically
02:55:13.080 just be like hey can you just promote
02:55:14.640 school a lot and I'd be like yeah he's
02:55:17.120 not like hey could you make make these
02:55:18.960 posts and write this copy and send these
02:55:21.439 emails and run ads and make the hooks
02:55:24.319 like this like that exchange has
02:55:27.040 literally never occurred like I don't
02:55:29.439 even know if Sam sees the ads before
02:55:31.359 before they they go out Moi takes me the
02:55:33.840 other day he was like when does the
02:55:35.239 activation stuff come out and I said
02:55:36.880 last
02:55:39.000 Thursday no like for real like I already
02:55:42.479 did
02:55:43.600 it and then he was like I've seen this
02:55:45.880 and I was like yeah I've already been
02:55:46.960 thinking about that we've got something
02:55:48.439 coming like we don't even I've already
02:55:51.080 thought about the next four things and
02:55:53.560 we've got things ready so by the time he
02:55:56.439 has the idea I'm like yeah we got it
02:55:57.960 don't worry do your thing and then I'm
02:56:00.800 like cool let me tell you what what I'm
02:56:02.000 doing on the media side it's like oh
02:56:03.359 [ __ ] great like these are all the things
02:56:05.720 that I'm ramping up this the system
02:56:06.920 we're putting in place like we changed
02:56:08.080 our Cadence like things like that it's
02:56:09.439 like oh dope I don't even want to think
02:56:11.160 about YouTube so like if I had to tell
02:56:14.359 him stuff oh my God like
02:56:18.680 yeah but it's good to divide it like
02:56:20.520 that cuz I can just focus on this stuff
02:56:22.479 he can focus on that stuff Kirby can
02:56:24.640 focus on his stuff we have very good
02:56:27.840 like division like that yeah the amount
02:56:30.120 of Direction you need to give someone is
02:56:31.279 inversely proportional to the skill they
02:56:32.880 have yeah someone could just be like hey
02:56:35.040 can you build this company and be like
02:56:36.560 sure people will complain like if people
02:56:39.399 it's always a sign of noticed when
02:56:40.920 people complain there's no
02:56:43.000 communication have you has anyone had
02:56:45.120 this as an
02:56:46.760 issue um like with teams maybe a lot of
02:56:50.000 you don't have teams yet but bad
02:56:51.399 communication communication sometimes
02:56:53.520 it's always the
02:56:54.880 complaint yeah I found it's interesting
02:56:57.239 that one
02:56:59.200 because you don't really need to
02:57:01.359 communicate a whole lot when you get the
02:57:02.760 right people like hosi said like a
02:57:05.000 couple of words and I was like don't
02:57:05.840 worry I got it like what happen like
02:57:09.680 right but sometimes if you hire the
02:57:11.680 wrong person there's no amount of
02:57:13.040 communication that can ever make it work
02:57:16.000 and it's
02:57:16.920 exhausting and just still doesn't work
02:57:20.000 and I think I understood this I think I
02:57:22.120 told this at one of the previous ones
02:57:23.520 but how you know what a good culture is
02:57:26.399 is this story of Google in the early
02:57:28.880 days so Larry Page searched for
02:57:32.960 something in the ads that showed up were
02:57:35.000 not relevant to the words he typed in he
02:57:37.680 took a screenshot he printed it off he
02:57:39.200 got a red marker and he wrote These ads
02:57:41.680 suck he walked over to the engineers and
02:57:44.479 he pinned it up on the wall and he
02:57:46.760 tapped it and one of them walked over
02:57:49.160 and picked it Off the Wall stayed up all
02:57:52.040 night that night and invented
02:57:54.760 AdSense which is their which has made
02:57:58.520 them hundreds of
02:58:00.479 billions chill so he didn't sit down
02:58:03.760 with them and be like look I think you
02:58:05.160 need to do this and this and this and
02:58:06.600 maybe this he just said these ads suck
02:58:09.960 right is that clear
02:58:11.960 communication I mean to him it was no
02:58:15.000 but that's what good talent is you can
02:58:16.920 just be like this thing they do this
02:58:20.239 yeah you don't even have to say do this
02:58:22.439 you can say this sucks sort it out like
02:58:25.880 and then they'll they'll be on it or
02:58:27.239 they might have already preempted what
02:58:28.960 sucks cuz they've already been thinking
02:58:30.560 about it so I always remember that when
02:58:33.640 people say oh like you need more
02:58:35.080 meetings or more communication like
02:58:36.760 there wasn't a meeting first of all
02:58:40.120 right there was there was slapping
02:58:42.080 something on the
02:58:43.359 wall yeah one of the most difficult
02:58:46.000 things this is like I think this from an
02:58:47.560 entrepreneur perspective in terms of
02:58:49.720 development is like has anyone here had
02:58:52.319 another business before
02:58:53.760 this yes okay did you achieve in this
02:58:56.840 business what you achieved in your last
02:58:58.680 business like in like from how long it
02:59:01.120 took you to get to that level in your
02:59:02.640 the business before versus how long it
02:59:04.359 took you to get to that level with this
02:59:05.840 business was it way
02:59:07.439 faster and so a lot of the reasons is
02:59:10.080 because you already beat the bosses up
02:59:11.399 to that level so it's kind of like
02:59:12.399 you're quickly retracing your steps and
02:59:13.840 then you get to a level that you don't
02:59:15.239 to your level of incompetence the
02:59:17.479 difficulty the the thing that takes the
02:59:19.680 longest in entrepreneurship is figuring
02:59:21.600 out what good looks like at each level
02:59:24.720 and it's one of those things that's
02:59:25.800 really hard to translate like you see
02:59:27.359 the billionaires on stage and they're
02:59:28.520 just like I you know get great people
02:59:31.080 and you're like
02:59:32.760 sure but the thing is is that connecting
02:59:35.520 what great people to them looks like in
02:59:37.479 their mind and what you think great
02:59:39.000 people are that is an ocean apart and so
02:59:42.520 I mean I tell this story and same when I
02:59:44.120 was talking about this last time but
02:59:45.399 like I when we started meeting with
02:59:47.319 private Equity firms
02:59:48.600 uh to to to look at transacting with gym
02:59:51.399 Lodge I we'd have these super long
02:59:53.840 tables that were these boardrooms and
02:59:56.200 I'd see their team all the way on this
02:59:57.640 side I saw my team all the way on this
02:59:59.239 side and I would just kind of sit there
03:00:01.120 and listen to like the questions that
03:00:02.840 they were asking and the responses that
03:00:04.560 my team had to be fair the team that we
03:00:06.000 had had built $100 million plus company
03:00:08.160 pre covid obviously I sold during Co
03:00:10.040 which actually hurt my valuation but not
03:00:11.800 the point um so they built a $100
03:00:14.359 million company which is cool but when I
03:00:16.880 saw this the town on this side I was
03:00:18.600 like oh that's why these guys are going
03:00:19.960 to make $3 billion over the next 5 years
03:00:23.080 this team and it was such a stark
03:00:25.399 contrast in terms of the level of talent
03:00:27.080 again not disrespecting my team it was
03:00:28.760 just such a difference that it was
03:00:31.080 literally like after that immediately I
03:00:32.960 was like my whole bar was just reset in
03:00:35.560 terms of the caliber of the people that
03:00:37.960 even existed in the world and everything
03:00:40.720 was like how on Earth do I get those
03:00:42.720 people to work for me and so like right
03:00:46.279 now some of you have like one person
03:00:48.359 who's like man I couldn't live without
03:00:49.520 that person there's somebody who's
03:00:51.359 literally 10 times better than that
03:00:52.760 person that exists right now and it's
03:00:54.640 just trying to figure out what you need
03:00:56.000 to do to get them on your team but the
03:00:58.359 problem that takes so long is looking at
03:01:01.000 what good talent in general looks like
03:01:03.000 but even when it gets R specific like
03:01:04.600 Sam had to do all this research to
03:01:05.760 figure out like how do good software
03:01:07.840 Engineers talk like what do they like
03:01:09.399 what do they want and so some of you
03:01:10.920 guys are at a point where you need to
03:01:11.840 like start hiring a sales director
03:01:13.200 something like that like what happens is
03:01:15.600 like this is the entrepreneural journal
03:01:16.800 it looks like you bring someone on you
03:01:18.680 talk to a bunch of people and then
03:01:19.520 you're like I think this guy's good you
03:01:20.760 bring him in and he sucks and that takes
03:01:23.080 six months away from the growth that you
03:01:24.439 would have had because your sales team
03:01:25.600 drops and this guy sucked you put bad
03:01:27.040 processes in then you got to fix the
03:01:28.479 process you got to fire the people that
03:01:29.600 guy hire cuz he sucked anyways and then
03:01:31.319 you're like shoot I'm going to try again
03:01:32.840 you bring the next guy in and then
03:01:34.680 sometimes it happens again and you're
03:01:35.760 like wow this sucked and then the third
03:01:37.680 time and sometimes this takes a year or
03:01:39.359 two years and then you're like I now
03:01:41.160 know and you get lucky and you get one
03:01:43.560 who actually works and you're like oh
03:01:45.600 this is what a great sales director
03:01:46.760 looks like and so the next time you go
03:01:48.439 through your entrepreneur JY like you go
03:01:50.279 right to there and then you're like
03:01:51.239 shoot I don't know what a good customer
03:01:52.439 success person looks like and then you
03:01:53.800 try again and so it's like however
03:01:55.560 quickly you can work through that so you
03:01:57.000 can start recognizing the pattern of a
03:01:58.800 what good looks like in general and then
03:02:00.200 B what it what good looks like for a
03:02:02.000 specific role that's how quickly you
03:02:04.439 move through the levels that's been my
03:02:06.960 experience with this and I wish I try
03:02:08.600 and do everything I can to try and
03:02:09.680 translate that into the stories that I
03:02:10.880 tell with the content but sometime it's
03:02:12.920 really tough because people like nod but
03:02:15.800 like that is that is the secret sauce
03:02:18.239 like that is it is being able to
03:02:19.279 recognize like what a good growth
03:02:21.200 partner looks like what a good even a
03:02:23.399 good agency I've have good I have good
03:02:24.880 agencies that we work with now the vast
03:02:26.760 majority of them 95% of them are dog
03:02:29.439 [ __ ] some of you guys run
03:02:31.560 [Laughter]
03:02:34.720 them so you know what I'm
03:02:38.439 saying so like that's that's that's
03:02:40.960 that's the pattern recognition that's
03:02:42.319 the highest value thing that you end up
03:02:43.600 learning as an entrepreneur is what what
03:02:45.520 good looks like so obviously like I'm
03:02:47.640 I'm doing a lot of the management for
03:02:49.239 our community and that includes like
03:02:52.200 making posts from from as
03:02:54.960 Jus and obviously Justin has like lots
03:02:57.560 of businesses you know like construction
03:03:00.479 he's going to be like on helicopter soon
03:03:02.279 like shooting whatever so and how how
03:03:05.560 could we maximize his time within the
03:03:08.279 community cuz right now he's doing two
03:03:10.359 calls two calls a month I mean I mean if
03:03:13.319 you if you modeled what I mean what my
03:03:15.960 contribution right now is I do one call
03:03:17.399 a week and we do this once a month
03:03:19.840 that's my contribution and then I ad hoc
03:03:23.160 look at you know I poke around and I see
03:03:25.080 what people are asking and then I end up
03:03:26.399 usually just like I haven't committed to
03:03:28.560 anything I just write one or two posts a
03:03:31.880 week sorry a month that are just
03:03:34.640 whatever is kind of top of mind you said
03:03:37.520 like on the calls that you do right like
03:03:39.359 you treat it like a meeting like a on
03:03:41.840 the calls for the school games like the
03:03:43.880 weekly or the monthly call you just kind
03:03:45.680 of sit there and just like treat it like
03:03:47.200 a yeah they're Q&A they're like this
03:03:50.120 when he said like a meeting he batches
03:03:51.720 it on the day that he does all of his
03:03:53.200 meetings yeah I do my school call on my
03:03:55.080 day where I have all my meetings so it's
03:03:56.920 not as disruptive as if he was like I
03:04:00.120 don't know writing a book and then he
03:04:01.720 had to switch gears to do a zoom and
03:04:04.479 then switch back into the book that's
03:04:07.640 that's going to take more than an hour
03:04:09.160 or like I can't record like if we're
03:04:10.479 going to go record you know some YouTube
03:04:12.120 videos or something and that's my whole
03:04:13.920 warning I can't like start recording
03:04:15.960 YouTube videos and be like hold on guys
03:04:17.760 and then like go take a call and then go
03:04:19.520 back to record like it just doesn't work
03:04:21.359 and Kirby's there to make it less taxing
03:04:25.000 on hosi so hosi doesn't have to scan the
03:04:27.640 chat or pick the questions yeah so like
03:04:31.040 if you're going to do a call have
03:04:32.439 someone like Kirby on so you're Kirby in
03:04:35.319 this like I would just literally model
03:04:36.960 what what he what what Kirby does on a
03:04:38.840 regular basis and just just replace
03:04:40.800 roles it's same same setup and you
03:04:43.680 record them and it turns into content
03:04:45.960 yeah I also record them too so I so so
03:04:48.960 Daniel's but you got I mean actually
03:04:50.760 shoot you guys have probably seen some
03:04:52.239 of them me yelling at the at the laptop
03:04:54.560 I don't know if you see him on Instagram
03:04:55.920 but um some of them done really well um
03:04:58.600 but he's right there I've got my webcam
03:05:01.760 here and
03:05:03.800 so those get clipped into content for me
03:05:07.200 so it's like I'm doing delivery for the
03:05:10.319 people you know for the school Community
03:05:11.760 but I'm also getting clips for marketing
03:05:13.920 and those get those get hammered out so
03:05:16.760 it's you get double
03:05:18.200 do you record your course yeah and I
03:05:20.439 post them in a call recordings with time
03:05:22.520 stamps as well in the classroom page you
03:05:25.319 make content with it are you guys
03:05:26.920 recording it with another camera like
03:05:28.560 for we we could make content with it we
03:05:30.560 we haven't done it yet I'd recommend it
03:05:32.760 because like you'll get the I'll bet you
03:05:34.080 you get the most heated yeah you get
03:05:35.960 like super heated I get I mean I get
03:05:37.720 heated on the calls cuz if you can use
03:05:39.920 it for many purposes it's a much more
03:05:42.479 efficient use of time yeah cuz that 1
03:05:45.160 hour made content it bought in customers
03:05:48.520 it delivered value it made a recording
03:05:51.319 do you know what I mean and then people
03:05:52.680 also ask like if you think about this
03:05:54.880 publicly if you're promoting a snippet
03:05:56.600 people are like how do I get on those
03:05:57.960 calls MH and then he just yeah people
03:06:01.279 really like when like Justin gets really
03:06:03.040 passionate about like things that he's
03:06:04.720 just interested in on a daily basis so
03:06:06.760 yeah those those those probably those
03:06:08.399 moments will probably be the best reals
03:06:10.560 or whatever yeah all my best Clips are
03:06:12.960 just moments where I just freak out at
03:06:14.439 someone so this next part's super
03:06:16.399 important it's about client and Avatar
03:06:19.000 selection so one of the big reasons a
03:06:20.520 lot of businesses suck to actually
03:06:22.600 operate is that you have too many
03:06:23.680 different customers who want too many
03:06:24.760 different things and so you had to
03:06:26.479 promise lots of different things to
03:06:27.600 everybody to get them to buy but now you
03:06:29.200 got to deliver on all those different
03:06:30.479 things to all those different people and
03:06:31.960 so learning to sell and specifically
03:06:34.000 learning how to sell the right people
03:06:35.680 and say no to the wrong people is a
03:06:37.920 skill that will absolutely unlock growth
03:06:40.520 and profit in the business because
03:06:41.800 you'll get more of the right people
03:06:42.880 because you'll talk to them and you'll
03:06:44.439 Ward away the ones that suck I have one
03:06:46.120 little question how do uh how did you
03:06:48.000 and kale meet or you know how did CL
03:06:50.680 really same story that's so cool man he
03:06:52.560 had a clay his gym was losing money he
03:06:54.319 was working a 9 to-5 job he would work
03:06:56.560 from 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. at his gym
03:06:58.640 teaching sessions he'd go to his job at
03:07:00.600 9:30 or whatever work from 9:00 to 5 go
03:07:04.279 back to his gym teach all the evening
03:07:06.160 sessions 5 6 7 8 his wife had just had a
03:07:09.520 baby she was pregnant with her second
03:07:11.120 child all of his income from his primary
03:07:13.760 business went into the gym that was
03:07:15.600 losing money and they had nothing left
03:07:18.080 over and so he called me up or he didn't
03:07:21.479 call me up and like he responded to an
03:07:22.840 ad and I got on the sales call and and
03:07:24.920 um I was like all right it's whatever it
03:07:27.120 was at the time he was like he was
03:07:28.800 honestly the first 10 customers I sold
03:07:31.319 um and he was like I I would buy this I
03:07:34.120 need this um but I just gave my last 10
03:07:37.680 grand or my only 10 grand to this coach
03:07:39.880 that was going to teach me how to have
03:07:41.040 an online Fitness business and I was
03:07:43.239 like do you have an online Fitness
03:07:44.279 business and he was like no I it didn't
03:07:46.479 it didn't work or whatever
03:07:48.040 I was like well what if we just made
03:07:49.359 your gym make money would that be more
03:07:51.439 he's like yes I'm fine with just making
03:07:52.920 my gym make money and so um I asked him
03:07:56.279 put 1,000 bucks down and he like put
03:07:58.359 $1,000 onto a credit card or something
03:08:00.399 that's so beautiful bro that's so that's
03:08:02.160 sick he made $38,000 in his first 30
03:08:04.319 days I I think I think that's the
03:08:06.000 coolest story in the world whenever you
03:08:07.560 give some like give somebody the chance
03:08:08.960 to buy an at a thousand knowing you you
03:08:10.640 probably never even let nobody buy
03:08:12.120 anything no everybody started a th000
03:08:13.560 bucks for the first three years
03:08:16.000 wow cuz all gym owners are broke all gym
03:08:19.359 owners are broke and so it's a th000
03:08:21.080 down th000 a week so the thing is is
03:08:24.200 that and this is what everyone in the
03:08:25.720 entire like the entire infos space still
03:08:27.840 doesn't get because everyone's like my
03:08:29.319 programs it's like no it's not it's not
03:08:31.479 it's not the average gym that still to
03:08:34.359 this day goes through gym watch makes
03:08:35.520 over $20,000 in additional new Revenue
03:08:37.160 in their first 30 days average average
03:08:40.359 first 30 days we track it because it's
03:08:42.520 such an important metric for us and the
03:08:44.560 reason that we have to do that is
03:08:46.920 because they don't have the money to pay
03:08:48.840 me what I want to get paid and so it's
03:08:51.520 was like I know that the system's going
03:08:53.080 to on average on average triple your
03:08:55.200 profit will go from 36,000 to 112,000 in
03:08:59.239 profit net of our fees is in after
03:09:00.720 you've paid us you'll make 112,000
03:09:03.120 that's the average over a
03:09:05.760 year but when you're broke it doesn't
03:09:08.640 matter because you're still broke and
03:09:10.520 you can't buy anything so it's like put
03:09:12.399 1,000 bucks down and I still needed him
03:09:14.560 to have money for ads so he had like
03:09:16.399 $3,000 I like keep two for ads give one
03:09:19.239 to me and you're going to run this ad
03:09:21.680 which is a video of
03:09:23.319 Ila you're going to run this ad to this
03:09:25.680 landing page that I've made you're going
03:09:26.800 to put your logo at the top and then
03:09:28.520 when these leads come in I was like
03:09:29.560 you're going to call them like you need
03:09:30.880 to feed your family which you do and so
03:09:33.200 it's exactly what he did and so um once
03:09:36.600 the you know the second payment came in
03:09:38.319 and I'd give them like a 14-day delay
03:09:39.960 because most of them didn't have any
03:09:41.000 money and so they would pay it they
03:09:43.680 collect cash from the people that were
03:09:45.239 coming in and they could make the
03:09:46.279 payments and then I gave them incentive
03:09:48.000 in the first 30 days to prepay the rest
03:09:49.760 of the thing at a discount and so that
03:09:51.960 way it turned $1,000 down into 16 Grand
03:09:55.120 in the first month and so my LTV to CAC
03:09:57.279 and my cash flow in terms of acquisition
03:09:58.880 was super strong um and then like we ran
03:10:02.279 that we ran that for very very very long
03:10:04.520 time I think like a year and a half ago
03:10:07.120 I think um after after I sold and Kel
03:10:09.760 took over he switched it from a front
03:10:11.160 end and back into just selling a year
03:10:13.239 for 36 I think is what it is um and so
03:10:17.000 that's what they do now and it's just uh
03:10:18.840 they bill every 28 days and I think it's
03:10:20.239 $29.97 or something like that a month so
03:10:22.080 it's you know 3K down or whatever and um
03:10:25.760 and that's and that's fundamentally what
03:10:27.479 happens but like I'm just saying like
03:10:29.640 the reason the niching is is useful is
03:10:31.760 that when you Niche down you can
03:10:32.920 productize the delivery like there's no
03:10:36.239 generic business quote Consulting that
03:10:38.840 can ever deliver as consistent of an
03:10:40.760 outcome as a very Niche business can
03:10:44.359 because imagine if you had to do it
03:10:45.800 generically you'd be like okay come up
03:10:47.319 with an offer make something free and
03:10:49.359 you'd want to run it to a lead gen page
03:10:50.960 and then when the leads come in you want
03:10:52.279 to call them quickly you have to talk in
03:10:53.920 generalities whereas I was like here is
03:10:55.960 the ad this is the landing page this is
03:10:58.200 how you set up your lobby when they walk
03:10:59.760 in say these words this is the price
03:11:01.920 you're going to sell at and by the way
03:11:03.840 here's the delivery for it here's the
03:11:05.359 mail plans here's the cookbook here's
03:11:07.000 the eating out guide here's all that
03:11:08.760 stuff you can put your logo on it you
03:11:10.080 can make it yours I already spent all
03:11:11.319 the time doing it and the sales training
03:11:13.120 they went through was the sales training
03:11:14.279 I put my trainers at my gyms through
03:11:16.880 which by the way my sales training was
03:11:18.640 less than 1 hour and so there's all this
03:11:20.720 closure training out there that's
03:11:22.279 hundreds of hours long but when I needed
03:11:24.600 to get guys to close it was 60 Minutes
03:11:27.200 it was like this is what you say to them
03:11:29.080 it wasn't psychology it wasn't like so
03:11:31.200 we want to increase their demand I was
03:11:32.760 like when they walk in the door say this
03:11:34.960 and then after they agree say the next
03:11:36.479 thing and if they don't agree you don't
03:11:37.840 move on until they agree then you go to
03:11:39.479 the next thing and then here's where you
03:11:41.279 ask for
03:11:42.680 money that was it cuz I wasn't trying to
03:11:44.800 make a course to impress people I was
03:11:46.439 trying to make a training that op one a
03:11:48.239 result and again I did turnarounds for 2
03:11:50.760 years and so like I had to give stuff
03:11:53.279 that to busy gym owners who hadn't paid
03:11:54.840 me cuz the the turnaround business they
03:11:56.160 didn't pay me so I had to make the
03:11:57.680 training for them like how do you do
03:11:59.279 nutrition was 130 minute video that was
03:12:01.800 it I was like this is the color template
03:12:04.479 weigh them in divide their weight by 10
03:12:06.279 which means you just move the decimal I
03:12:08.120 like had to break it down I was like
03:12:09.319 okay so means you have 21 food units put
03:12:11.920 the first eight over here this is all
03:12:13.439 their protein then you can tell them you
03:12:14.600 can scatter the rest between carbs and
03:12:16.000 fat you just do the yellow list got it
03:12:18.439 great have them take a picture with it
03:12:20.080 in front of them that way their numers
03:12:21.359 there put it against a wall like this
03:12:23.520 like there's just there's nothing they
03:12:25.520 could mess up and because of that
03:12:27.399 because all the variables were
03:12:28.239 controlled they all got a consistently
03:12:29.840 good outcome and they just took a long
03:12:30.920 time to do cuz I had actually done it at
03:12:34.319 multiple locations and then 30 plus
03:12:35.880 turnarounds in different markets so also
03:12:38.040 when I get the customer who is like this
03:12:39.920 won't work in my market I'm like I've
03:12:41.920 got five other gyms on your
03:12:45.160 block but people are very limited you
03:12:47.520 know I had a I had one of the gym
03:12:48.720 turnarounds that I did I launched the
03:12:50.800 gym this is important just for your
03:12:52.640 customers I launched the guy's gym and
03:12:55.319 when I decided to switch to licensing I
03:12:56.800 called back all the guys who hadd done
03:12:58.000 the turnarounds for I was like these
03:12:59.080 will be the easiest Sal they literally
03:13:00.200 saw me crank 100 grand out of their gym
03:13:01.760 in 3
03:13:02.760 weeks called one of the guys up and he's
03:13:04.840 like how do I know it's going to
03:13:07.680 work I was like I just did it in front
03:13:10.920 of you like I you saw me meet with 250
03:13:14.800 people and he's like well I don't know
03:13:16.640 if it's going to work worked for me and
03:13:18.680 I was like you will never win but like
03:13:21.239 some people are like
03:13:22.600 that and I was like it's not worth the
03:13:24.680 time just move on it's a really specific
03:13:26.760 situation so like so I started as a BDC
03:13:29.000 offer right but my top 10% of guys who
03:13:31.120 like really kill it are the existing
03:13:32.600 agency owners usually stuck at like a
03:13:33.840 certain range and I install like the
03:13:34.880 closer infrastructure and all that stuff
03:13:37.040 how if I wanted to explore that and make
03:13:38.439 that to 100% how would I deal with my
03:13:40.279 existing 40 guys who got in at a BC
03:13:42.640 offer who have this like expectation
03:13:45.399 that I that I could like the B Toc offer
03:13:47.920 is what a make money like a generic how
03:13:49.800 to start an agency offer
03:13:52.720 yeah yeah I would get rid of those yeah
03:13:56.359 well same thing with this way just like
03:13:58.520 again LTV to CAC like how much does it
03:14:00.399 cost to acquire them how much like when
03:14:02.560 when people were trying to decide
03:14:03.520 between avatars which by the way the
03:14:05.279 concern you have is the probably the
03:14:06.760 number one most common concern that
03:14:08.439 people have in business it's also one of
03:14:09.560 the biggest leverage points that you can
03:14:10.840 have is picking the right Avatar so
03:14:13.040 you're in this overarching space of
03:14:15.840 agency but
03:14:17.800 if you like almost always when you go up
03:14:19.680 Market you make more money almost always
03:14:22.120 and so when you deal with somebody who's
03:14:24.520 a higher quality Prospect they pay more
03:14:27.880 they're lower maintenance because they
03:14:29.279 already have more skills coming into it
03:14:32.319 um and so forth right and so if you just
03:14:36.120 look at CU I had a I had a hair salon uh
03:14:38.560 lady asked me this question so she was
03:14:40.040 like I have I'm getting 17 to1 um or
03:14:44.319 sorry 24 to1 uh selling uh um hair
03:14:48.040 stylist on my extension technique so she
03:14:49.800 had some extension technique that was
03:14:51.319 like extensions are like two grand and
03:14:53.720 it and if you and she had a technique to
03:14:55.319 do it in like 30 minutes so they could
03:14:57.239 make a ton of money in a very short
03:14:58.640 period of time and she's like and I have
03:15:01.200 business consulting or coaching or
03:15:02.680 whatever which has like 11:1 um LTV toac
03:15:06.960 she was like so should I focus on like
03:15:08.640 my business coaching offer or should I
03:15:10.359 just sell this hair extension just like
03:15:13.080 teaching how to do hair extensions which
03:15:14.520 is not really a business offer at all
03:15:15.800 it's just like how to it's like a hair
03:15:17.560 thing right and
03:15:19.720 so I just boiled it down to LTV to cak
03:15:22.760 times Tam so it's like if you have crazy
03:15:25.120 LTV attack and you have a massive Market
03:15:26.960 which she did there's way more hair
03:15:28.080 stylists who don't want business
03:15:29.080 coaching and just want to learn more
03:15:30.439 about hair so it's like you have both
03:15:32.120 more customers and a bigger discrepancy
03:15:34.319 between what it cost you and what you
03:15:35.800 make and so then the only thing is just
03:15:38.239 n and if there is a massive market then
03:15:39.920 you can crank n as in the number of
03:15:41.239 units sold by a timeon and so I was like
03:15:43.880 and from there you can cross sell the
03:15:45.080 coaching thing if you want to the
03:15:46.160 business Consulting but stop running two
03:15:48.439 two front ends focus on this one that
03:15:50.399 you have the greatest Arbitrage on smash
03:15:52.640 the [ __ ] out of that and then all your
03:15:54.080 focus becomes on ascension and cross
03:15:56.040 cell does that make sense so for you I
03:15:58.800 would probably like you're going to have
03:16:00.239 to Sunset the the 40 guys over time if
03:16:03.160 you are better at delivering a result
03:16:04.960 like go where the value is as in whoever
03:16:07.760 you can help the absolute most is who I
03:16:09.960 think you should sell to so if you're
03:16:11.720 like I have three different people I
03:16:12.680 help it's like well which of them like
03:16:14.160 this happens in um I had a lady who had
03:16:17.239 tile business so she sold tiles like a
03:16:19.080 very generic business she's like I sell
03:16:21.600 to homeowners I sell to uh designers
03:16:24.319 interior designers and i s a home
03:16:25.720 builders three completely separate
03:16:27.920 avatars I was like okay which one's
03:16:30.960 worth the most to you she's like well
03:16:32.880 homeb Builders are pretty much just only
03:16:34.199 care about price I was like okay well
03:16:36.000 then maybe you don't sell to them
03:16:37.680 interior designers she was like these
03:16:39.520 people um they're they bring me
03:16:41.800 customers all the time like they come
03:16:43.160 with their the person they're doing the
03:16:44.760 living room for whatever and then you
03:16:47.199 know the people who just own homes he's
03:16:48.960 like they're you know they're kind of
03:16:49.800 like oneoff sales but they have the most
03:16:51.279 margin I was like
03:16:54.439 okay I was like which one do you like
03:16:56.279 doing the most she was like the interior
03:16:57.800 designers I was like how many people
03:16:58.880 does an interior designer bring you on
03:17:00.199 average per year and she was like 30 I
03:17:02.439 was like okay so she was calculating it
03:17:05.239 at a transactional level rather than at
03:17:06.960 the res at the interior designer level I
03:17:09.560 like so how much does it cost you to get
03:17:11.399 I was like how do you get interior
03:17:12.160 designer she's like I do Outreach for a
03:17:14.800 week once a month and I get like three
03:17:17.080 to five more interior designers who come
03:17:18.680 in I walk the facility and then I
03:17:20.640 showare them what we do um and this I
03:17:23.279 mean this business was doing 7.6 million
03:17:26.080 Topline and like 5 million in iida
03:17:28.239 murdering it um and so I was like cool
03:17:32.760 so you now are the the interior designer
03:17:36.239 is now your avatar so you need to become
03:17:38.319 the interior designer de you need to
03:17:39.520 make their life amazing don't sell to
03:17:41.080 home builders don't sell to home home
03:17:42.760 owners just interior designers that are
03:17:45.040 people that you've got on your roster
03:17:46.640 and and then all you do is you go from
03:17:48.120 having 30 interior designers that send
03:17:50.439 you business all the time to 300 and
03:17:52.680 that's it and there's 300 interior
03:17:54.000 designers every setting and so all she
03:17:55.800 has to do and she already had a way to
03:17:56.800 acquire them I was like forget
03:17:57.760 everything else so it's like you want to
03:17:59.120 just like sake through that and a lot of
03:18:01.040 times that's where this massive unlock
03:18:02.560 happens in businesses like in most
03:18:05.080 businesses go through this because you
03:18:06.080 start throwing stuff on the wall you
03:18:07.760 start selling stuff you start looking at
03:18:09.279 the customers you have and then you're
03:18:10.439 like huh I'm really good at these people
03:18:12.199 I suck at these people these ones are
03:18:13.640 okay and then you start making your
03:18:16.319 delivery you make a decision
03:18:17.520 strategically to say no to this money
03:18:19.000 and this is where people can't do it
03:18:20.399 this is why everyone fails they can't
03:18:22.000 say no to money so you have to say no so
03:18:24.840 when the 41st person comes on the phone
03:18:26.600 with you and it's like hey dude I like
03:18:28.760 really need this like I'd love to have a
03:18:30.279 way to you know make money online or
03:18:32.760 whatever you're like you should just
03:18:33.560 watch for most these videos for free and
03:18:35.080 then start a business and when you have
03:18:36.199 a business call
03:18:37.520 me okay so like I know my I mean what
03:18:40.880 I'm what I'm best at is the acquisition
03:18:42.359 fulfillment and the operations of
03:18:43.720 existing agencies like my two best
03:18:45.479 clients your course away for the money
03:18:47.399 people give it away for free okay give
03:18:50.640 it away for free it'll me and then
03:18:51.760 you'll be like look I've had 40 people
03:18:53.239 pay me whatever they sold you know you
03:18:54.560 paid it's like and I just want to overd
03:18:55.680 deliver in value and I'll give it to you
03:18:56.760 for free and so use it because I really
03:18:59.399 just want to work better with agency
03:19:00.520 owners because the 0o to one stuff you
03:19:03.359 can just just do it just do the work
03:19:04.920 it's not that hard once like that way
03:19:06.800 you can self proove that you're legit
03:19:08.520 and then I will tell help you scale it
03:19:09.840 from there and then like tangible items
03:19:12.760 to like actually Sunset them like what
03:19:14.439 does that even look like how long was
03:19:16.479 the sale for the 40 how long did you
03:19:19.359 sell them for was the duration it was
03:19:21.279 like I was starting off it was like an
03:19:22.479 inner circle just like 6K like Lifetime
03:19:25.640 right so this is the problem with
03:19:27.840 lifetime deals yeah you have a onetime
03:19:30.439 onetime income with a forever delivery
03:19:33.960 um like right so the the real real the
03:19:37.000 ethical way to do it refund I think pull
03:19:39.760 the rug refund so if I make the decision
03:19:41.120 just hard conversation refund Integrity
03:19:43.840 restore that's going to suck but okay
03:19:46.000 how many of them are
03:19:47.880 what's up how many 40 I am send them to
03:19:52.239 someone else
03:19:53.800 maybe but wait are they still how long
03:19:56.239 has it been it's been like two months oh
03:19:59.800 okay I mean I would like this is the
03:20:03.520 like this is the tough part you know
03:20:06.000 like you either I mean the alternative
03:20:08.279 is you like the thing the thing I don't
03:20:10.319 like cuz if you had said it's a 12we
03:20:11.920 program then i' would have been like
03:20:12.960 fine live it out like finish it out but
03:20:14.600 you're like lifetime you're just going
03:20:16.439 to these people forever ask months in
03:20:19.199 yeah yeah cuz that's at least going to
03:20:21.239 be 12 months you got 10 months so you
03:20:23.960 got to trade off like you could probably
03:20:25.439 get away with it if it had been a year
03:20:27.840 yeah but you were only just starting
03:20:30.640 yeah to go all in on school I had to re
03:20:33.479 I had a calculation of how many of my
03:20:35.439 Mastermind members I had to refund I had
03:20:38.439 to refund $2
03:20:41.439 million to go all in on school that was
03:20:44.439 losing 700 Grand a month
03:20:47.880 how about that did he say losing yeah
03:20:51.279 losing is it I refunded 2 million to
03:20:53.600 focus on something that was losing 700
03:20:55.600 Grand a month damn why
03:20:59.319 why I don't know
03:21:01.760 RIS n it's worth it like if you do all
03:21:04.760 the math it it was a Nob brainer
03:21:09.160 yeah PA steal yeah it's just you want to
03:21:12.000 play in the big league I mean the things
03:21:13.199 these are mistakes like people make
03:21:14.600 mistakes in the beginning lifetime is
03:21:15.840 easy to sell but just cuz you don't
03:21:17.160 think about
03:21:18.279 ramifications but saying no to money is
03:21:20.520 always what yeah is the biggest thing
03:21:23.439 that makes you like that after I did
03:21:26.080 that I had a massive jump cuz I could
03:21:29.239 focus on school right um and you know
03:21:35.560 people offer me like a lot of money too
03:21:37.359 to go and like speak in an event
03:21:38.840 probably nowhere near as much as hosi
03:21:40.359 but 100 Grand in first class flights you
03:21:43.239 just say no no no no no no no no no then
03:21:46.239 you don't even bother saying no you just
03:21:47.920 don't even imply yeah and that if you
03:21:51.080 don't have the discipline to do that
03:21:53.720 then you'll get pulled in a million
03:21:56.560 directions also when you feel that sting
03:21:58.960 of the 240 Grand you have to give back
03:22:01.399 it'll help you say no to everything else
03:22:03.040 cuz you're like I just refunded all
03:22:04.600 these people I'm definitely not going to
03:22:05.920 mess that up now like I just spent all
03:22:08.120 this money to to get this attention back
03:22:10.040 like why would I mess it up yeah it does
03:22:12.399 something too for your like personal
03:22:14.080 power or something when you're say no to
03:22:15.800 money you don't need it yeah you're like
03:22:18.000 you show you it does something to you it
03:22:21.239 gives you some kind of power there's no
03:22:22.560 better feeling than turning money down I
03:22:24.920 mean making money is also pretty good
03:22:27.479 but especially with clients you don't
03:22:29.520 like anymore yeah right I would prefer
03:22:32.239 to never see you again here's your money
03:22:34.520 yeah really I got like a little taste of
03:22:36.720 it cuz I was like I'm like the
03:22:37.600 gatekeeper of the main closer so if I
03:22:38.960 didn't think I could coach the guy I'd
03:22:40.040 be like no but refunding is a whole
03:22:42.840 different kind of thing right there yeah
03:22:44.840 totally but you'll feel super super
03:22:46.720 convicted and when you get on the phone
03:22:48.239 with people you'll be like this is for
03:22:50.199 agency owners and I'll help you scale or
03:22:51.960 whatever you know whatever you're good
03:22:53.040 at and if you're not then you're like
03:22:54.640 that's why I have this thing I used to
03:22:55.800 sell it I'll just give it to you man
03:22:57.680 just follow the steps realistically
03:22:59.199 though you're probably not going to do
03:23:01.560 it so at least this way you can save
03:23:03.640 your eight grand which I probably could
03:23:04.760 have sold
03:23:06.880 you it's big conviction that's sick
03:23:09.520 sweet I like I have the same thought as
03:23:12.040 him cuz I have a a program called start
03:23:14.399 and then scale but uh sell to the scale
03:23:17.359 people if you're better at them and you
03:23:18.439 like them better and they're worth more
03:23:19.760 100% um I did have a question if it's
03:23:23.080 better offline that's cool how do you
03:23:25.640 for instance like somebody joins at 30
03:23:27.600 gets to 200 how do you Market that
03:23:30.239 testimonial without uh a financial
03:23:35.080 claim so how can I actively share these
03:23:38.279 stories so getting into the like
03:23:40.560 nitty-gritty with FTC is beyond my scope
03:23:42.960 but for the most part it comes down to
03:23:44.640 timelines that's the thing that like
03:23:46.560 most of these platforms hate it's like X
03:23:49.199 in y time but if you just say x I did I
03:23:53.399 thought about this quite a bit Yeah and
03:23:55.640 I've noticed that the only people that
03:23:57.160 ever get in
03:23:58.160 trouble they did way worse [ __ ] than
03:24:00.520 make a
03:24:01.880 claim right cuz I know the people that
03:24:04.479 got into trouble and I know what was
03:24:06.000 going on and I'll tell you how it
03:24:08.080 happens every single time yeah it's they
03:24:11.279 don't give refunds their disputes go up
03:24:14.880 they piss so many people off that enough
03:24:17.160 complain to the attorney general that
03:24:19.640 eventually so many complaints go to the
03:24:21.640 attorney general that they investigate
03:24:24.920 them and then they find everything like
03:24:27.760 the first thing to go is always you get
03:24:29.760 kicked off of stripe yeah way that's
03:24:32.399 slate the canary and the comine no one
03:24:34.960 that doesn't get kicked off stripe never
03:24:36.880 they never get in trouble even if
03:24:38.279 they're making wild claims on ads but
03:24:41.279 then when these people get
03:24:43.040 panged they've got to like say oh
03:24:46.640 everyone's doing it everyone's breaking
03:24:49.160 the rules because they're trying to show
03:24:51.160 like that they're not a criminal yeah we
03:24:52.960 just cross we just stepped on this
03:24:54.199 Little Rock the the refunds thing is Bar
03:24:56.600 None for sure like I there was a guy I'm
03:24:58.840 sure we both know him but who um who got
03:25:01.479 dinged by the FTC ding's a very nice way
03:25:03.680 of saying it um and I knew for like I I
03:25:07.479 I was in a room like this cuz I was was
03:25:09.160 in the back room and he was speaking at
03:25:10.960 the same thing as me so like kind of
03:25:12.680 funny um and he was like how do you guys
03:25:15.960 like stop all these chargebacks and I
03:25:18.040 was I was like what he was like yeah all
03:25:20.479 these people like they're just these
03:25:21.760 [ __ ] are charging back and I was
03:25:23.120 like well I mean I was like we don't
03:25:24.960 have we just refund people if they ask
03:25:26.520 for it he's like oh no we don't do
03:25:28.399 refunds I was like I mean at all he's
03:25:31.920 like we say no refunds I was like but
03:25:33.439 you you you actually don't give any
03:25:35.239 refunds he was like oh no I also I mean
03:25:37.080 Sam said this I think like three ago and
03:25:38.920 I just love this it's like you don't
03:25:40.080 want to become someone's project like
03:25:42.439 you don't want someone waking up
03:25:43.439 thinking like how can I destroy shark
03:25:45.600 today like how can I ruin this guy's
03:25:47.560 life cuz cuz that six grand was the last
03:25:49.880 six grand he had and it meant a hell of
03:25:52.000 a lot more to him than it does to you so
03:25:53.960 just give it it means more to him back
03:25:56.520 just go get another customer bro it's
03:25:58.359 always worth it you just give him the
03:25:59.760 money back and they come back too like
03:26:03.080 we noticed that they a lot of people
03:26:04.800 come back when you didn't make a big
03:26:06.960 deal about it or they'll buy something
03:26:08.600 else yeah cuz you know what it's like
03:26:10.080 your self you buy something you ask for
03:26:11.760 refund you're like how's hard's this
03:26:13.040 going to be and if it's easy you're like
03:26:15.960 damn I'm I I like this company right yep
03:26:20.920 so Planet Fitness believe it or not I
03:26:22.439 obviously a fitness example CU I know a
03:26:23.840 lot of the the big businesses there but
03:26:26.040 Planet Fitness figured this out which is
03:26:28.120 so you might not know this but a Planet
03:26:30.120 Fitness to make money has to have 10,000
03:26:31.800 members like a brick and mo has to have
03:26:33.600 10,000 members to to make money and they
03:26:35.560 still crank and they can do that in a
03:26:38.399 market that only has 50,000 people in
03:26:40.319 total which is insane to think about but
03:26:43.359 they don't have like zero turn they have
03:26:45.800 like five % monthly turn which is you're
03:26:47.760 like wait a second how would you do that
03:26:49.800 they cycle through the entire town over
03:26:52.160 and over and over again and so what they
03:26:54.560 figured out was rather than being like
03:26:56.080 the dicks on the way out they said they
03:26:57.680 call the friendly goodbye and so it's
03:26:59.640 like they they're like oh you want to
03:27:00.880 cancel no problem Steve no worries let
03:27:02.640 us know when you're you know when you're
03:27:03.920 want to come back like we we'll get you
03:27:05.560 going like very friendly on the exit and
03:27:08.120 so then Steve when he like gets the next
03:27:10.199 gig or gets to the next job or feels fat
03:27:12.040 again or whatever it is he signs back up
03:27:14.359 because it was no big deal
03:27:16.960 it's also crazy how many people don't
03:27:19.319 actually use the membership they like
03:27:21.960 pay for it and then oh 92% don't use the
03:27:23.920 membership yeah it's the only it's the
03:27:25.840 only way the business model works if
03:27:27.920 they did they'd have to charge $200 a
03:27:29.439 month it yeah wouldn't be room yeah I
03:27:32.279 mean the reason micro Jims are priced
03:27:33.760 that way is because people use the
03:27:35.399 membership it's the same SC footage so
03:27:38.279 like like the worst thing that and so
03:27:40.520 like I mean I can talk about planus
03:27:41.800 Fitness but I'll
03:27:43.239 stop how would you choose between the
03:27:45.479 friendly good
03:27:46.680 and then the one that he mentioned where
03:27:48.600 it's like if you leave you have to pay
03:27:50.840 the entry fee to come back those are
03:27:52.760 different one is a refund one is like
03:27:54.479 someone trying to cancel which I see is
03:27:56.840 separate things one's saying hey I want
03:27:58.080 to cancel your service one is like I
03:27:59.720 hate you please give me my money back
03:28:02.239 it's not very friendly to say you can't
03:28:03.920 come back ever
03:28:05.760 again and it's also not really true I
03:28:08.319 think cuz someone can just make another
03:28:09.680 account how are you going to know well
03:28:11.760 for high ticket I can imagine but like I
03:28:13.319 just whatever I mean I've all the the
03:28:15.479 people that I know who have done it and
03:28:17.120 don't have good communities it does
03:28:18.479 nothing if you have a great Community
03:28:20.319 then it matters but then doesn't matter
03:28:22.080 at all because the great Community is
03:28:23.239 the reason that it happened so tldr I
03:28:25.399 don't know if the tactic does anything
03:28:27.399 remember I had this on a way smaller
03:28:28.720 scale it was like my second clo like 10K
03:28:30.800 I was all excited and he he's on the
03:28:32.920 coaching call and he just wouldn't knock
03:28:34.120 on doors he said he tried it for 30
03:28:35.680 minutes CU one thing he teach is door to
03:28:37.120 door marketing to book jobs so I was
03:28:39.359 really hesitant on what to do and I he
03:28:40.880 just bring down the energy so I let him
03:28:42.920 out of the group I refunded him and then
03:28:44.319 I posted in my free Facebook group hey
03:28:46.199 had a client wasn't really ready to
03:28:47.479 knock on doors you know if any of you
03:28:48.920 guys are are actually willing to do this
03:28:50.199 we have a spot open and it brought my
03:28:51.560 ideal clients actually B close four off.
03:28:54.800 post you're like in every week you're
03:28:56.800 like I had I had a spot open up
03:29:00.840 because yeah no mean being telling the
03:29:02.960 truth yeah I got I got one question
03:29:04.560 about like um I've heard you guys talk
03:29:06.640 about like offboarding interviews or
03:29:08.279 like you know like taking you know
03:29:09.680 somebody wants to you know wants to
03:29:11.080 cancel their membership or wants to ref
03:29:12.600 refund you're like yeah for sure just do
03:29:14.000 an interview right is there any way we
03:29:16.120 could maybe get that going on in school
03:29:17.720 like whenever somebody churns like
03:29:19.520 obviously like it's hard to get them on
03:29:21.479 the phone right you know at that point
03:29:23.680 um but I'd love to like figure out maybe
03:29:25.880 that at some point like oh yeah you want
03:29:27.160 to cancel cool press this button
03:29:29.319 schedule an appointment after we talk I
03:29:31.680 think they have to be able to cancel
03:29:32.760 easily but I think yeah they have to be
03:29:34.880 able to cancel easily but I think you
03:29:36.520 could encourage them to take a call
03:29:37.840 after the cancellation try and resell
03:29:39.120 them could we do a zapier integration
03:29:40.600 for the cancellation this is we were
03:29:42.960 just thinking an auto an auto DM would
03:29:45.120 probably be the be Auto DM yeah I've
03:29:48.239 noticed uh the zapier integration the
03:29:49.920 zapier integration feature on School Is
03:29:51.319 Amazing by the way but um we started
03:29:53.239 doing this in one of our communities
03:29:54.160 where people join and we immediately
03:29:55.479 send them like a welcome call and then
03:29:57.359 we just like immediately upsell them it
03:29:59.279 does really well are the new customers Z
03:30:01.800 yeah oh yeah that crushes just for
03:30:04.600 everybody by the way if you if you let
03:30:07.000 people come in and just give them an
03:30:08.479 onboarding call it's I mean think about
03:30:11.000 what an onboarding call really is it's
03:30:12.279 like what are your goals what have you
03:30:14.160 struggled with where are you at
03:30:15.399 currently
03:30:16.520 what do you like why haven't you
03:30:17.520 succeeded so far oh I think we might
03:30:19.720 have some things for you it's just like
03:30:21.800 it just lends itself naturally to a
03:30:23.120 sales call and you can do in autod DM as
03:30:25.199 well if you have a strong referral offer
03:30:27.040 can put it into autod DM when they join
03:30:29.040 and like who else do you know blah blah
03:30:30.640 blah you'll get this if you refer
03:30:32.439 somebody so that you know you set it up
03:30:34.520 once and you can have literally like
03:30:37.000 extra 10% for free if you have a strong
03:30:38.680 referral
03:30:40.760 offer and once they affiliate things
03:30:42.800 it'll be even more just going back on
03:30:45.080 that single stream or yeah um what
03:30:47.279 you're good at one thing we have is we
03:30:50.199 have that physical Academy so um what I
03:30:53.279 was one of my questions earlier was
03:30:56.040 about how would you integrate School
03:30:59.080 platform into the physical you know what
03:31:02.680 just random thoughts um but
03:31:06.880 then because I think our the school
03:31:10.000 academy has
03:31:11.880 done by far you know mostly yeah better
03:31:15.439 than
03:31:16.880 physical um what are your thoughts on
03:31:20.080 integrating ditching I don't I mean I
03:31:22.920 think the in-person members joining I
03:31:25.239 mean you could if you want to give a a a
03:31:27.319 gift to the in-person members you could
03:31:29.399 actually I don't know if they can have a
03:31:30.399 different membership so no um they
03:31:32.520 probably just join like anybody else
03:31:34.319 would and it would just be a benefit to
03:31:35.720 them to because they know you in person
03:31:37.399 is the digital already making more
03:31:40.520 money yeah the the P academ do kind of
03:31:43.239 like how we're doing this and school HQ
03:31:45.880 so we've got homos HQ we've got school
03:31:47.840 HQ for the power users in the online
03:31:50.840 world we bring it offline and we let
03:31:54.279 them come in like this and that can
03:31:57.040 produce content back for the like online
03:32:01.040 so you use it as a a reward yeah yeah
03:32:03.840 you can either like you can charge for
03:32:05.199 it or you can use it as a reward for
03:32:06.680 like what we do here right we're not
03:32:07.720 charge for it but it's it's a reward but
03:32:09.920 you Absolut like as a side note if you
03:32:11.840 wanted to make even more like if you
03:32:13.319 wanted the inperson to generate more
03:32:15.359 money and leveraged kind of like both
03:32:17.600 together give them an offer to have a
03:32:19.920 weekend with you I mean like when I had
03:32:22.080 the you have it's not it's martial arts
03:32:24.080 right yeah so I would do like weekend
03:32:25.880 workshops where I'd be like we're going
03:32:26.960 to do a deadlift um you know prr we're
03:32:29.399 going to do the big three lifts for
03:32:30.560 powerlifting this weekend so anybody
03:32:31.800 wants to come to that cool I do like big
03:32:34.279 booty boot camp for girls and they
03:32:36.040 always want I teach them like eight
03:32:37.399 different like moves for butt stuff
03:32:39.319 because they always want to noteb stuff
03:32:41.040 I would do um I would basically just
03:32:42.880 bring in Specialists for stuff and then
03:32:44.520 I would either and I would just Market
03:32:45.840 CR to my community and say that they
03:32:48.239 could pay you know a grand or two grand
03:32:50.040 or something for the for the weekend I
03:32:52.160 mean you'll know the price point better
03:32:53.120 than me but Pro I mean you could
03:32:54.800 probably get away with between $300 and
03:32:57.000 $2,000 in terms of two days um for them
03:33:01.000 to to come in and you spend two days
03:33:03.319 with them and you get a ton of footage
03:33:04.720 you literally make money for it you can
03:33:06.160 get ads for your local gym you can get
03:33:07.760 ads for online all from that one event I
03:33:11.520 actually think it's a huge advantage
03:33:13.040 that you have the inperson component
03:33:15.359 because you can do stuff that no one
03:33:16.399 else can
03:33:17.680 do level seven in school Community is
03:33:20.479 visit School HQ the the prize like once
03:33:23.560 you get to level seven in school
03:33:25.080 Community you get to visit School HQ
03:33:27.279 that's cool and then in the games it's
03:33:30.199 get in the top 10 and you get to come to
03:33:32.319 a MOS HQ it's the best prize on both
03:33:36.000 leaderboards it it creates this cuz in
03:33:38.279 the digital world everything seems kind
03:33:39.880 of fake so if there's some HQ that
03:33:42.920 people get to visit and you start to see
03:33:44.960 photos of this play it gives people like
03:33:48.080 something they can visualize like I can
03:33:50.720 eventually go
03:33:52.359 there right and it works really well and
03:33:55.120 you can use it in your marketing and and
03:33:56.760 all of this I can guarantee you that if
03:33:58.680 you make a post in your community saying
03:34:00.239 that you're doing a workshop that you're
03:34:01.520 limiting to 30 people how many people do
03:34:04.000 you have in your community free ones
03:34:06.560 well the paid one paid one
03:34:09.399 23 yeah so um I mean you could do it on
03:34:12.680 the free one if you wanted to cuz then
03:34:14.000 you could just sell them at the event if
03:34:15.080 you felt like it but but I think it
03:34:16.279 makes more sense to do it to the paid
03:34:17.399 one and just do a higher ticket thing
03:34:18.880 from the paid and um so if you have 23
03:34:21.600 that's perfect so that'll probably
03:34:23.000 you'll probably get like 30ish people
03:34:25.520 who'd be willing to do it and so do you
03:34:28.560 30 you know between 300 maybe I mean
03:34:31.359 it's meditation like 300 to a grand
03:34:33.960 probably feels about right you can pick
03:34:35.279 the price you can start low on the first
03:34:36.479 one and move it up if you want to if
03:34:37.960 it's like people are like that was
03:34:39.439 amazing blah blah blah blah blah um it's
03:34:42.479 like you can just do that like once a
03:34:44.000 quarter so every 12 weeks or so and just
03:34:46.880 like that you can pop an extra like 80
03:34:48.560 or 100 Grand a year in like and but like
03:34:51.399 you're not just doing it for money you
03:34:52.640 get all the other stuff
