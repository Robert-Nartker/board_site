00:00:00.520 you know when I think about the
00:00:01.599 profession and the change in the last 20
00:00:03.679 years or so I think one of the more
00:00:05.400 fundamental elements is that as a
00:00:08.039 profession we have looked much broader
00:00:10.639 as to where our skill sets and
00:00:12.719 competencies really can make a
00:00:14.200 difference in the world sustainability
00:00:16.279 is a major example of that way too many
00:00:19.039 people in our profession only thought
00:00:20.519 about our role and S of the accounting
00:00:22.160 and auditing and function uh and the
00:00:24.240 audit function aspect the reality is
00:00:26.960 this wider notion of business
00:00:28.880 information are in the case of
00:00:31.360 sustainability this wider notion of
00:00:33.680 information that affects our planet
00:00:35.320 going forward is a critical component of
00:00:38.160 how we can have an expanded role and
00:00:40.360 make a difference in society how we
00:00:42.640 measure sustainability how we report on
00:00:44.640 it how we tell a story of its impact and
00:00:47.440 how we drive business decision- making
00:00:49.199 related to that and when we roll that
00:00:51.320 forward when we think about the future a
00:00:53.160 longer term future you know a lot of
00:00:54.920 things in sustainability are focused on
00:00:56.719 2050 and we when we think about even a
00:00:59.239 2050
00:01:00.480 I think the opportunities for the
00:01:02.160 profession in this broader footprint of
00:01:04.438 business information is going to be
00:01:06.680 absolutely essential and we tend to
00:01:08.720 think about sustainability of our world
00:01:11.080 of our planet in the in the areas of of
00:01:14.159 climate or environmental issues to per
00:01:16.799 se the reality is in the next 20 or 30
00:01:20.799 years we're going to face this notion of
00:01:23.320 almost things unimaginable to us clearly
00:01:26.000 artificial intelligence is a component
00:01:27.960 of that and I think that's really our
00:01:29.920 challenge as a profession to think more
00:01:31.799 broadly and to understand that what we
00:01:33.880 bring to the table what we bring to the
00:01:36.439 table in in the in the form of of trust
00:01:39.560 and reliability and quality is critical
00:01:42.680 for society as a whole to address these
00:01:44.799 major issues and finally I would say
00:01:47.680 from uh the accounting bodies Network
00:01:50.560 a4s it's a place where organizations
00:01:53.640 that really are connected and can make a
00:01:55.479 difference in the profession can come
00:01:57.039 together to collaborate to do things
00:01:59.399 Collective ly sometimes but at least to
00:02:01.840 share best practices to have this
00:02:03.680 broader impact and to really drive a
00:02:06.159 change in thinking in the profession and
00:02:08.560 connect that to what people who are
00:02:10.959 multi-stakeholders not just shareholders
00:02:13.080 but people who interact with business
00:02:15.280 and governments and Society can actually
00:02:18.080 derive from the work that we're doing
