Dan Hood (00:03):

Welcome to On the Air with Accounting Today. I'm editor-in-chief Dan Hood. The accounting profession will mark a major milestone at the end of this year. I'm with Barry Melancon, the longtime head of the AICPA steps down. After 30 years, we're lucky enough to have him join us to look back over his time leading the profession. Last episode we focused on how things have changed and how he changed things since he became president and CEO of the Institute in 1995. And in this episode, we're going to look to the future. Barry, thanks for joining us.

Barry Melancon  (00:28):

Dans great to be with you and I can't wait for this topic. The future is my favorite topic and I think the future is just going to be fantastic for our profession and man, it's certainly changing so rapidly, the whole world that we live in. So talking about the future is an exciting moment, so thank you for having me.

Dan Hood (00:46):

Yeah, we're excited about it. I will say you've been a member of our Top 100 Most Influential People list for a million years, and we always ask the members of that list to say who they think is influential. They routinely name you as the top of that, and almost inevitably the most common reason they cite is your ability to look forward for the profession and see what's coming down the pike and where the profession should be headed and what's coming at it and all that sort of stuff. So I'm psyched to talk about it with you. Maybe we can start, I don't want to be gloomy, but maybe we'll start with some of the challenges facing the profession. Then later on we'll get to some of the reasons why the profession, the future, excuse me, is really bright for the profession I think. But for now, why don't we talk a little bit about the challenges.

Barry Melancon  (01:26):

Well, Dan, before we do that, if I could just because that introduction was so great and you talk about people saying I'm the most influential or whatever, it's not really me. It's the collective us, the collective staff, our member volunteers. I spoke about at our last AICPA council meeting in October, which was my last AICPA council meeting is that you are who are around you basically. And that's not perfect grammar, but the reality is each of us is a factor of people around you and it's been so fortunate for me to be around so many amazing people. And so the notion of seeing into the future is very much an inexact science and picking that up from everyone and different people's perspectives and sort of cobbling that together to connect it dots is maybe what I think I can do pretty well. But it is that collection of thinking.

(02:20):

So yes, there are gloomy topics that people want to talk about. Look, we live in a world that's got certainly unpredictable economics. We have major conflicts around the world. We have major uncertainty as to what AI is going to do as it relates to changing employment and changing how people even think about work and life balance and what work is defined even as all of those things, demographic challenges in many different places in the world, not all places, but many different places, certainly in the United States, but I don't really see them as overly gloomy. Obviously we don't want conflict battles between people. We want that solved and hopefully our leaders working with leaders and else place in the world will solve that. But I do think our ability to change is our biggest challenge because it's moving so fast. The expectations of the public are changing so rapidly and we talked about it in the last podcast, but this notion of seeing our role in a much broader sense of broader business information, if we don't do that, I think there is a bit of gloominess in that perspective because sort of our core services will have greater and greater and greater impact from the technologies that are being delivered.

(03:39):

And I think on a global stage, our ability to find a role as the United States of America and sort of emphasize our global profession is a critical component. And as a country, as people, we have to continue to change and we can't really hold onto the past. The world technology's not, the economy's not going to let us do that. I think those are the biggest challenges out there

Dan Hood (04:04):

Right now. You've repeatedly warned, I've heard you repeatedly warned people that the pace of change is never going to get any slower than it is now where it's only going to accelerate, which is going to require that sort of nimbleness that you talked about.

Barry Melancon  (04:16):

That's correct. It never will be, and people are stressed out over the speed today, but the reality is it's never going to be as slow as it is today. That's the world, and that's not just like ai. It's not unique to our profession, but our profession, if we're going to be that prime profession in the business world and the individual elements of lifestyle and what people's sort of own financial situation is, we have to be ready for that. And our ability to train people and our ability to be adaptive in that is so critically important. And sort of what comes with that, Dan, is this notion we have this DNA of wanting to be right. We don't like giving advice where we can't sort of answer the question completely. We talked about PPP and Covid in the earlier, and we actually did that very well. There was a lot of uncertainty and we thrived in that as a profession and we have to continue to thrive with that uncertainty because we aren't going to live in a world where as a profession we can give absolute answers and that uncertainty is something that we have to deal with from a competency perspective.

Dan Hood (05:32):

Well, let's talk about that a little bit because the notion of what people need to do to be ready for the future always sort of fascinates me. Obviously as you say, that's one area where getting comfortable with that level of uncertainty, with a range of possibilities as opposed to a single specific concrete answer is something that some accountants are getting comfortable with, I think. But that as a profession, maybe as a whole need to do more on. What are the things do you think accountants need to do to get ready for this future?

Barry Melancon  (06:02):

To me, it's about competencies and business models. So if you're in corporate, it's the business model change of whatever entity you're in and whatever industry you're in. And in public practice it's how do you change business models? And the notion that business models of the whole was predominantly a pyramid shape leverage model since the 1940s, that model is probably not going to sustain itself. And that business model is a lot about the agility and a lot about taking risk in that environment, but still being objective and who people want to turn to because you're competent. And then that competency adds to, we've got to change competencies. And so if I was, and I have talked to many of room of young professionals, but I think this commitment to changing my competencies is absolutely essential. And Dan, you've heard me say this, I think the most vulnerable in our profession is the mid-career professional people who are entering our profession.

(07:02):

They're digital natives. They've come through life really with a different mindset towards that. The people who are ready to retire, the notion of having to change has got a smaller delta than the person who's got 20 years or so left to work. The amount of change, can you imagine what the profession will look like in 20 years? It's my job to think about that, and it's really, really, really hard to think about really what that could be. I do know it's going to be much different. I do know it's going to go through several iterations and our ability to be comfortable in that and to adapt to our skill sets, for instance in ai, but not only ai, to connect the dots, to be strategic, to take risk actually I think is really, really important. And that's going to be what we have to be able to get our arms around

Dan Hood (07:57):

Right worth. I think, and this will pivot to my next question, it's worth remembering that all these skills in terms of change management and being ready to change your skillset, to update your skill sets, what is it to learn to unlearn and to relearn all those sorts of things. It's not just about the challenges that are coming down the pike, right? It's not just about that. It's about the opportunities. There are a tremendous number of opportunities facing the profession. And maybe to gloom us a little bit, let's talk about some of those. As you look forward, what do you think are some of the big opportunities for accountants?

Barry Melancon  (08:32):

Well, first off, I think, let's say again, from a public practice or an employer perspective, either one, businesses and people's individual finance is just full of uncertainties. And so they're turning to us to help think through those things, to think through that notion of where it might go and to be knowledgeable in that space, I think that's the number one, to be a settling rational voice, but still to be open to these changes that will happen. So there's no entrepreneur out there, even those in ai, that the businesses that are in ai, they just have this high degree of uncertainty. How do I build the business? What's the right amount of risk? It is just endless the types of discussions that are going on not to dismiss because there's even greater old line industries of how much change and how can we change that. I like to start with the process of thinking about how the world's going to change because we can get very narrow about, oh my God, this is happening to our profession, or this is happening to my client in X industry.

(09:40):

Look, I think in 10 years we're going to have gone through major debates of what is the definition of work and what's the expectation of work from a society? There's all sorts of scenario plans that you can go through, but if you sat down with a client or a wealthy individual and you talked about those elements and just really had honest questions and somewhat admitting that you don't know all the answers, but helping people think through those things, I think there's huge value through the trusted advisor role to really do that. And firms that can structure themselves in a way that could deliver on that, I think they're going to build loyalty with clients that these changes take place. That'll be really, really, really hard to lose because it's that handholding and this high degree of uncertainty that people really value and businesses really value.

Dan Hood (10:32):

I mean, if you think about it, if accountants are concerned about and confused about and uncertain about the future, you can only imagine how much more so their clients are concerned about and confused by and uncertain about the future. And so the values you say of having that handholding, that guide through it would be enormous. I'd like to talk just briefly about the opportunity in sustain. You mentioned sustainability a little bit, but the whole ESG space, particularly around assurance, but there's also an enormous advisory opportunity there as well. Maybe we talk just briefly about that.

Barry Melancon  (11:03):

Well, a lot of people in our profession and certainly a lot of the largest firms are gravitating to the advisory part. I prefer to start with the assurance part because I do think we are moving to a world and let's admit that's going to slow down in the United States because of the results of the elections in November. That's just a true statement. However, there are market forces in play. There are international regulations that are in play that is still going to cause this to happen, and it's also going to move down channels. So most of the time I talk to practitioners and say, I'm at a smaller firm or my clients are smaller businesses, it's not going to happen. That's just not true. The reality is that big business would market forces and certainly if they do business outside of the United States, that's going to be a major emphasis.

(11:47):

And so I think the assurance part is going to be a major part and getting our arms around that, that's just assurance and audit or coming out of Sarbanes Oxley assurance and internal controls or in these emerging areas of controls that are not even sarbanes oxley related. I think it has been a huge expansion of the profession. And so I do think firms, this is probably first or larger firms, but not just the big four, a top 100, a top 200. I think the notion of assurance in this space I think is really important. And that continuous, the sort of notion of the annuitized type of service consulting is important as well. And some will go down that path. But I do think that that may be shorter lived than what assurance will be in that space. Now, why is it important? Look, I've been very active in this space, but I wouldn't say I am a way out there environmentalist.

(12:51):

I'm a person who is I think very practical in that I think there are nature aspects that are playing out that man does not have anything to do with. And I just think that we need to sit back as sort of people who occupy the planet earth today and do as best we can. Not everything is the same cause and effect that everybody speaks about that is really out there, but there is some cause and effect. There is some implication. And I think as a role, as a profession, we have an obligation to have sort of a role in that space, not because it's politically correct, but because it is happening in the world. All you have to do is see some of the pictures of plastics in the ocean and say, man, we ought to be able to do some stuff associated with this. But at the same time, I'm a boater. I boat on Long Island salmon. 10,000 years ago it was a glacier. It didn't melt because of what man did. So there is a balance in this notion, and I think a voice at the profession in that space of balance is sort of what we're known for.

Dan Hood (13:55):

And certainly to bring some practical perspective to it and also, I mean take it even to a more basic level, even if regardless of what your feelings are about cause effect, the environment, all that sort of stuff, the markets are beginning to demand and will continue to demand. Governments are putting these requirements in place, there's going to be requirements for these things, whether you agree with them or not, and best that they be done by people who know best that the assurance around them be provided by people who know how to do that,

Barry Melancon  (14:24):

Right? You could say, well, I philosophically and politically don't believe a state ought to have income tax, but yet there are other states that have income tax. You got to help your client deal with that. Or I don't necessarily agree with an alternative minimum tax, or I don't necessarily agree with the rate that is in our income tax structure, but you still have the professional obligation to help your clients deal with those issues. And it's no different in this sustainability space where the market is causing things to happen. If you're a business that is public, it's certainly a big business. Or if you're a business that's very important in someone's either supply chain or customer chain. They're going to have obligations as businesses try to comply with this. Now, I think the profession has a voice, and this has been our voice. We need a global set of answers so that it's not so burdensome on businesses to comply. It needs to not be overly complicated, that it's almost impossible to comply, and there's an element of crawl, walk, run. We can't expect perfection in this process day one, but at the same time, we ought to be the voice that doesn't allow people to say anything in so-called greenwashing that has no accountability in this space. That's a role that we play in a almost immeasurable number of areas over history. Why wouldn't we play that role in this space?

Dan Hood (15:44):

It's all about trust. It's awesome. There are two particular areas I want to dive into in a second, but we've got to take a quick break first. Alright, and we're back talking about the future with Barry Melancon of the AICPA. We've talked broadly about some challenges and some opportunities particularly around ESG, but also tax we've talked about as a place where the profession is particularly well poised. I want to talk about two specific issues areas, let's call 'em that you had talked about. Maybe start with private equity. You had mentioned a little bit about the need to change models. Obviously private equity is playing a role there in helping accounting firms figure out what new models to explore on. What sort of impact do you think it's going to have on the profession? And I'll let you choose the timeframe if you want. Is it next couple of years longer term? And realizing again that this is a weird area that no one really, I don't think anyone has a strong handle on it, but as you look at it, what's your take on the potential impact for PE on accounting?

Barry Melancon  (16:48):

Well, first off on private equity, Dan, I've always been a person who believes that different models can work just because someone decided partnership models with the right model 80 years ago. It doesn't mean that that's the only thing that can happen today. I think we, let's just just have a level set. We have some large firms that have maintained and are totally committed to the traditional partnership model vis as example mergers of two very large firms in the US and then on a global basis that are partnership model. They seem to be very happy with that structure. And we have large firms that have gone private equity. We have a BDO that went ESOP. So different models to me is a good thing for the profession because then people who follow on to what people have done sort of in a first phase or an early phase could see what they think works best and they can choose for their firm or where they take their firm, they can choose based on that knowledge.

(17:44):

And I think that that's a good thing for the profession, not a bad thing for the profession. Now all of that is with the caveat that we have to follow the rules in the assurance space. We have to be committed to that trust quotient that the profession owns in the marketplace. And we have to defend with sort of every fiber of our bodies and every fiber of our professional commitment. That is critically important. Now, specifically to private equity, I think we have to be honest about some of the forces that, I mean, I think the aging population of people in some of these firms with retirement, the US model is a high pay partners retiring model is a big part. I think the profession for decades has not been a fair market value profession. You could buy in a formulaic price that a firm might set and you retired at a formulaic price.

(18:38):

That's not a fair market value notion. And clearly with the way the market has changed in general for all types of businesses, fair market value is very prevalent, funded by private equity, venture capital, et cetera. And so I think the profession being part of that is true. I think if we got together 10 years from now, the predominance of firms is still going to be traditional partnerships. So let's not get overly carried away with how much this is happening in this particular space. Now that all being said, I've spoken to many young people in our profession who love the fact about private equity because they can get ownership or pieces of ownership either in direct ownership or structured in effect of different units that allow them to participate. They're enamored by that rather than waiting 10, 12, 15 years to be a partner in a firm. So young people in some ways gravitate to that.

(19:40):

Some other young people don't and they could find firms that are having the traditional model in that space. I do think it requires private equity is going to change how tightly managed a firm is. It's going to definitely have specific KPIs on profitability and I obviously we have to make sure that profitability doesn't drive bad behavior. But the reality is, is that being better run and deploying capital and being more strategic about how we provide services, how we build accountabilities into those services, there's nothing wrong with that. Now, how does it all play out? The number one question I get with private equity is firms are going to flip and where does it all end? Barry, where does it all end? I have my own sort of theory on it. I have shared it with private equity people most of the time. Not every time I've gotten sort of knots that people give in that space and admit.

(20:39):

So what I say is, look, let's be honest, some are not going to work. I mean, going down this path, not everything works. Not everybody gets it all right. I think flips constant flips will have sort of an end in sight. And I think at some point firms will sell off pieces, parts maybe a cast practice or maybe a piece of a tax practice instead of flipping the whole term. But I think maybe a whole firm, I think maybe the most important point, what I believe, and maybe a lot of private equity people won't necessarily believe this, but some do. I believe private equity's investment in our profession will actually cause private equity to change. Private equity has our profession is very well run by great people. Firms make a nice living for people who have a long career in our profession. And I think private equity is going to evolve.

(21:35):

We have an excess supply over demand of private equity in this country, not only this country, many countries in the world, and the fact that a firm can do a better job of running itself and use capital differently and actually produce consistent profitability, which the profession historically has done. There's nothing wrong with a private equity fund being focused on providing institutional investors and family offices a consistent rate of return. And it's not always about a flip. I understand private equity has always been about a flip for the most part. But you look at Berkshire Hathaway as a public company, they do a pretty good job of buying companies on the big end and holding them. And so I think private equity, some private equity is going to follow suit with that because they're going to understand how that trusted role, that trusted advisor role of the profession and that continued support of the work with clients produces longer term plays than rather shorter term plays.

(22:40):

And so I think we'll see some with a lot of flips and I think we'll see some not so many flips. And I think that'll be part of the next three to five year evolution of private equity. I could be dead wrong on that, but I'm pretty confident that we're going to see some of that because I just think the profession is sort of a different vertical than what private equity. I know they bought other professionals verticals, but the CPA practice is such an annuitize repeat relationship business that I think that continuity is going to play a dividend in that process that they might not anticipate or might not have anticipated. I think it will cause some behavior to change.

Dan Hood (23:25):

I love the idea of the accounting profession overhauling private equity and changing that would be fascinating.

Barry Melancon  (23:32):

Maybe not, maybe not every aspect of equity

Dan Hood (23:34):

Wholesale change, it's going to a wholesale change.

Barry Melancon  (23:36):

No, no, no. Private equity will probably still do its other thing, but I think in our space we will see some evolution by private equity.

Dan Hood (23:45):

It's going to be very exciting to watch. We only have a couple of seconds left. I just want to ask, as you look forward, what advice would you give a young person joining the profession?

Barry Melancon  (23:56):

The best advice that I got within the first 30 days of me becoming CEO was actually from a big, at that time, six CEO, who I had never met before. And his very simple advice in the first five minutes of a meeting with him, it was actually Larry Weinbach, who's now deceased, but he was CEO of Anderson, which was the largest professional service firm in the world at the time. And he said, Barry, look, I don't know you, but people put you in this role. And only thing I can advise to you is to be yourself. I've tried to live by that every day. And I would say that to a young person, you've picked accounting or you've thought about picking accounting because of certain attributes that you see in the profession and certain attributes you have, and you have to be true to yourself. So that's the first part.

(24:43):

But secondly, I think passion is very important. People always talk about my passion for the profession. I think this profession is just amazing and it's so needed in society as a whole. And we really haven't spoken about AI impact maybe as much as we could, but I think we need young people in it, and they have to have a passion about the purpose of this profession and this sort of trusted advisor role, which I'm sure people get tired of hearing, but there's no trust in society today or very little of it. And we have a large inventory of trust. And so buying into that as a young person, what a great career to be associated with hundreds of thousands of people who abide by that and who, yes, we have weak links, and inevitably any group of people has weak links. But so many people in our profession, they're the salt of the earth and the salt of their communities, and they want to do the right things and they commit themselves to competencies to do it, to be part of that, what a fulfilling and rewarding career that you can have.

(25:49):

So those are the things that I would tell a young person on the topic of that. And then I would add to a topic we discussed earlier, and you have to be committed to agile change and changing your competencies. Don't believe you're entering this profession and it's static. Nothing in the world is static, but because we want to be this trusted professionals, we have to have an extra dose of willingness to change, in my opinion. And if you can balance that trust with that extra dose of change, you can have a really successful and fulfilling career. And if you study the history of the profession a little bit, you can see how valuable we are to making people successful. Dan, we use for our own organization this tagline that we say we support or we create trust, opportunity, and prosperity. And that's really the profession does. We create trust in things, we create opportunities for people. Look, our profession is critically important in emerging economies, an emerging economy going to sort of a developing economy. The development of a profession is a key component of that because of trust. So trust, opportunity and prosperity. Not prosperity for ourselves, but prosperity for society as a whole. And if you just think about those three words, just how fulfilling that can be, and I encourage people to think about that.

Dan Hood (27:18):

Excellent. It's a great thing to think about going forward, a great view of the future. Barry Melancon, thank you so much,

Barry Melancon  (27:24):

Dan. It's always great to be with you, and I want to thank you for the relationship. I'm sure we'll have a continued relationship going forward, at least I hope so. But the reality is that communication today and getting messages out is very difficult information clutter, and you obviously are an independent journalist, an independent publication, but the reality is that you've really focused on some of these really important issues in the profession, had been a vehicle of that. And I just wanted to personally thank you for that on behalf of the AICPA and the profession.

As he prepares to step down from his long tenure as president and CEO of the American Institute of CPAs, Barry Melancon looks back at how the institute —- and the accounting profession — have changed over the past 30 years. (Tune in next week to hear his thoughts on the future of the field.)

Dan Hood (00:03):
Welcome to On the Air With Accounting Today, I'm editor-in-chief Dan Hood. Most people in accounting can't remember a time when Barry Melancon wasn't the head of the American Institute of CPAs. It's a job he started way back in 1995, in which he's stepping down from at the end of this year, marking an epic in the history of the modern profession. We're lucky to have him join us on the podcast, and so since no single episode could contain him, we're going to do two with this first episode, taking a bit of a historical focus on the changes he has, and in many cases he has initiated over the course of his 30 years at the AICPA. Barry, thanks so much for joining us,

Barry Melancon (00:34):
Dan. It's always great to be with you and obviously all the listeners. I don't know about the epic part, but it's been a fun ride. And it's also, I think when you say it that way, it's indicative of the fact that I'm getting old. So that's the other side of that coin.

Dan Hood (00:51):
Veteran, seasoned, I think is the phrase I keep hearing.

Barry Melancon (00:53):
Very good.

Dan Hood (00:53):
No one says old anymore, they say seasoned,

(00:56):

But I think one of the things, people have been talking about this since you announced that you'd be stepping down and have been thinking about your tenure, which is unprecedented. I think we talked about how the vast majority of heads of the AICPA had been 10 to maybe 15 years, but over the course of 30 years, an enormous amount has changed. And I want to get a sense to start of how different the AICPA was in 1995. I'm not sure that people have a sense of how much ground you've covered since you joined in. How would you describe the AICPA in 1995?

Barry Melancon (01:31):
Well, people all remember this, but it was pretty lethargic. It was obviously not technologically aligned with even the technologies of '95. One of the things I did in the first 90 days was a massive reorganization of people and approaches, and that was purposely done. That was to change what we were doing. I think for the most part, the way I would summarize it, Dan, is professional bodies in general are about stopping things in professions under the guise of protection and all of those types of things. And my view and my position and was supported very clearly by our board of directors of the day was that no, we needed to be an enabler, that it is in the public interest for the profession to be able to do a wider variety of things that were attuned to what was happening in the marketplace, which clearly in the mid nineties was really the internet and things of that nature that was at the birth.

(02:35):

And I think that's probably the thing I'm most proud of is that we really shifted the notion of what is a professional body to be an enabler, a permission granter, yes, with guardrails to make sure that the profession lives up to its obligations of trust and competency that you would expect from the profession. But it's what we can do as opposed to thinking about what we can't do. And honestly, and people sometimes will disagree, but I honestly believe that is in the public interest because our economy is fueled on the relationship with the profession. And frankly, when the economy does better because of what we bring as a profession to the table, whether we're working in business and industry or whether we are in public practice, then that is a positive and that is in the public interest.

Dan Hood (03:22):
Right, right. Well, I mean there's certainly been, I think that change has been true. We're going to talk a little bit later about how you've seen the AICPA change, but I think that specific point of it's become an enabler and certainly an organization that looks forward and points the way forward for accounting firms and accountants, certainly that's a big change. And if it wasn't doing that in 1995, that alone is a big achievement. Maybe we'd take a broader picture even and talk about the profession itself. If the institute was protective and inward focused, what was the profession like?

Barry Melancon (03:54):
Well, the profession was accounting and auditing and tax and a little bit in the largest firms, the big eight, the consulting and advisory. But I think not so tremendous even in the next tier of firms, some dabbling in that space. And I think we unleashed a lot of that change. I think the leadership of, let's say the next 100 firms from a size perspective, really were just beginning to embrace that notion. And I think we fueled that to a large degree. So I think that the typical practitioner viewed themselves being in the profession of, and I know this is a video, but if you could see me, I've got my hands sort of narrowly put together narrowly thinking about accounting and auditing and tax and what I say, and a lot of my presentations today, I say, if you take nothing away other than this, it's that we have to think of ourselves in this business, this bigger business information space.

(04:51):

And that's what people want. Our skillset, our competencies, our trust and our capabilities to really deliver to the table. And accounting and auditing is as important part of that, or accounting in tax or big important parts of that, but it's not where the sphere ends. It's a much wider piece of impact, and that includes business processes and evolution and strategy and consulting and today cast and things of that nature that really is about a bigger set of information. Some people in our profession aren't happy with that. I mean, they're more comfortable. But I think the shift is that that was overwhelmingly the attitude of the profession back then. And I think now some in the profession have that narrow attitude. The vast majority have that broader attitude.

Dan Hood (05:43):
Yeah, it definitely, it seems from what one hears about the period that it was a much more insular, narrowly focused profession that there are accountants out there now currently doing things that the leaders of the profession in 1995 couldn't imagine or wouldn't have imagined.

Barry Melancon (05:58):
That's right. And I think some of those things, we've been very successful with some of those things. We have competition in different spaces, and maybe that's another one, Dan, to really focus. I do think we have to be better competitors in the marketplace as particularly from a public practice perspective, because if you think about accounting and auditing basically a reserve service in statute, you add tax, a marketplace permission that's pretty strongly affiliated with the profession, but some of these evolutionary activities that's been occurring in the last 30 years, we face competition in different ways and then I'll come back to our trust and ethics that sets us apart.

Dan Hood (06:40):
You talked a little bit about the restructuring issue in the first year or two when you took the helm at the AICPA. Maybe we could dive a little bit into that. What was involved or how did it free up the institute to focus? I keep saying phrasing it as focusing more on the future, but focusing more outwardly more broadly. How did that work?

Barry Melancon (06:59):
Yeah, it wasn't the first year or two. It continued in the first year or two. It was literally in the first 90 to 120 days where I really wanted to set that tone. And I think I was hired to do that, to set the tone of something different for the organization. And we made very significant shifts. And I think obviously the technical knowledge that the institute brings to the table is really important, but we emphasized it with bringing other aspects to it. We had some work there that was talking about this broader information set. It was actually chaired by a gentleman named Ed Jenkins who is no longer with us, but he went on to become chair of the FASB, but it was about this bigger business information set. Interestingly, I'll give you a little side note that very few people know from a historical perspective.

(07:50):

It talked about the need for us to be able to handle special purpose entities differently, which if you know the history in Enron, that was actually the sort of abuse of special purpose entities was to a large degree the downfall of Enron. And so we were really ahead of that. The whole notion of broader assurance services came about in that period of time and broader assurance services, meaning our ability to take our skillset and attest to things other than just accounting information. Today, of course, SOC reports as an example, millions of SOC reports are being issued around the globe, which was thought of an output of some of that early thinking in that broader notion of that. But as it relates to the specific reorganization, we put different emphasis in different places. We put greater emphasis in firm services. That was some of the early days of peer review then called quality review.

(08:48):

We made that hopefully much more workable from the standpoint of what was being built early in those days and more sort of this r and d notion of what the profession could do in these broader spaces. And frankly, we brought some things out, for instance, in the internet notion that actually didn't catch on, but it changed the attitude of how we think about the types of services that we can bring forward. And then within a two or three years, we had the whole big discussion about the creation of what is today, cpa.com. And basically my message on that was at that point in an internet world, WebMD had been created and was created not by the medical profession, but by some people unaffiliated with the medical profession. And I was a firm believer that we couldn't do that in the profession. We couldn't let what became known as cpa.com to be not something affiliated with the profession. And of course today everybody would agree that that was the right strategy.

Dan Hood (09:55):
Sure, yeah. I mean, when you look at what cpa.com, it's becoming what it does for the profession. He has no question. I wonder, I think there's some things we're not really making clear. You talked about sort what you were hired for, and it's worth pointing out that you were 36, 37 by far the youngest, certainly the youngest head of the AICPA, the youngest of the candidates for the job at the time, you felt when you were brought in, we were talking at some point, you were talking about how you went to a meeting with a recruiter and assuming that you weren't going to get the job. And so instead of doing an interview, you sort of said, here's what I think needs to be done to the AICPA. Is that a fair...

Barry Melancon (10:34):
One hour meal turned into a four hour meal, and it basically started with me saying, look, you and I know that the AICPA isn't good. Her, I was 36 at the time, a 36-year-old. It was from South Louisiana and never worked in a public company audit, not big eight firm, not Ivy League educated. And I said, so these are odds stacked against this conversation. So let me just tell you what I think ought to happen. And I laid out, it ended up being four hours of this and that and the other things, and I got the chance to try to do most of those things

Dan Hood (11:09):
I was going to say. So I mean, you're figuring from that interview, you're granted permission if they go with you, they're granting you some permission to shake things up, to make things different, and you certainly did. And I want to talk about some more of the ways in which you've shaken up the AICPA in the profession in a minute, but we're going to take a quick break. Alright. And we're back. We're talking with Barry Melancon of the AICPA. We're going to do two of these episodes. One looking back and one looking forward. And I have to say some of the looking back stuff to me is absolutely fascinating because as I mentioned, for many people, you're the only head of the AICPA. They've known and many of them don't know some of the, particularly the first steps when you first joined, took the home there, major restructuring.

(11:53):

There's since been plenty of other changes, but one of the biggest ones, and I just want to highlight this one for a second, is because it's a major, major milestone for the institute was the combination with CIMA and I want to say 2016, but the pandemic has completely messed with my time, my sense of time. I think it's 2016. But anyways, I would like to just talk a little bit about that because it is a major, elevation might be one word, but a major expansion of the institute and of the AICPA. And maybe talk a little bit about how that came about and what drove that and where you see it heading.

Barry Melancon (12:29):
There was several parts there. It's a great question and I do think it was a major element. So let's understand the strategy behind it. First off, at that point in time, we had about 140,000 of almost 400,000 members that worked in corporate America. And how did you create different sort of services and expertise? And in today's world, as we sit here in 2024, the transformation in the corporate finance space is epic. And you use that word earlier because it really is very significant and is sort of the early stages of what happens in the accounting profession overall. So CIMA was fully focused on management accounting, the people working in corporate, they were not in the US and they were in the rest of the world. And that the second sort of strategic driver of that was I felt very strongly that while we were the largest professional body, even prior to the combination, that there were other forces in play that would have some impact on the US' standing in driving the profession of the profession.

(13:34):

Quite frankly, we are the most local, most national and most global of all professions. And that global is really important because business is global and how can we ensure that impact not only in 2016 or not only in 2024, but in the decades to come and we had to have a different global footprint. And literally we had the decision of do we, and we had members all over the world because CPAs relocate all over the world. Do you go try to build that? Not that you don't buy a fellow membership organization, but in the corporate sense, do you buy that or do you bring that in from already built? And we felt that was the most effective way. But what it came down to in the simplest way, Dan, was we clearly, and I say we because our board was fully behind, ultimately AICPA council was fully behind the largest firms, the mid-size firms.

(14:26):

89% of our membership voted for It was that I think it's really important as to who has a seat at the table about those things affecting the profession forever and how do we make sure of that and guaranteeing to be a voice from both the corporate and public accounting perspective and being the largest ensures that, and we have to continue to build on that as the years go by. But I will say in such things as sustainability as an example where we have been the only professional accountancy body with a seat at the table, we've sort of proven that strategy out and it's a complex world. And so we've got to be really, really good in the states. We've got to be really, really good at Washington dc get the national, but we also have to be really good from a global perspective because that's actually what the profession looks like,

Dan Hood (15:17):
Right? And certainly as you look at some of the opportunities for the future, many of them have more of a global element to them. We're going to talk about that though in the second episode. I don't want to steal too much from that. And I do look a little bit back because at some point I was making a list of things that have happened at the AICPA or because of the AICPA over the past 30 years, and it's a very long list. We've touched on a couple of them. The restructuring when you first joined the creation of cpa.com, the merger combination with sema, and I wanted to get a sense from you as you look back, obviously those are three big things that happened with the AICPA. If there are other big changes to the AICPA that you've seen, but also you talked about Enron, maybe we can talk about some of the major turning points or events for the profession as a whole. Why don't we start with looking at the AICPA? Have we missed any major changes at the A SPA other than those three big ones we talked about?

Barry Melancon (16:13):
So I want to sort of throw into that the computerization of the CPA exam. And I think that was a big one, not the fact that the exam would become computerized, because ultimately that was certainly going to be the case. But because it was very early, it was 2004, which meant we started working on that. Actually, it was the largest project ever for the AICPA. We started working on that in 2000. We had to sell all of the state boards, the regulatory bodies in the states, and that was a major element that was really critically component. What I used to say back then is you could not say to the world we're this modern profession that can do all of these services and has all these skill sets and literally test people with a paper and pencil exam that used the dollar 99 calculator. And I said that so many times that people got tired of hearing it.

(17:04):

But we had to be very early on that and we built simulations and some modern approaches to it. And I think that was a major change in that notion. I would also say, because today we have a lot of debate about human capital and pipeline from 1990, so remember I started in 1995. From 1990 to 1999, we had a reduction by 50% of those people majoring in accounting in that decade. By the time we got to 2005, we had record numbers of people majoring in accounting. And a lot of that was because of the dotcom bust. A lot of that actually was because of Enron and some of the focal point, the purpose-driven aspect of what the profession did. And I would say things today, how do we manage AI and how do we deal with environmental issues is also rejuvenating people's interests back in accounting because of the purpose aspect of the profession.

(17:59):

I do think another one was just getting through Enron and WorldCom, but what people don't focus on that I think was critically important. People criticize what we did, but the profession did extraordinarily well coming through in running WorldCom, much more so than other people thought. But one of the key components was we fought very hard to keep the private company elements of the self-regulatory process, peer review, auditing standards and ethics. And that paid huge dividends for our profession because frankly, some of the PCOB activities and the auditing standards of public companies had become bogged down in a lot of politics and other things. We've been able to keep moving the profession forward because of that self-regulatory process and the modernization. And most people would agree, the modernization of the audit, for instance, and the broader assurance footprint we've been able to deliver because we do have that responsibility.

Dan Hood (18:56):
And you can certainly, I mean in all elements there, the AICPA has been active. I mean, one of the things on my long list of things was sort of focused on audit quality and different ways of setting up the audit quality centers and the Center for Audit quality itself, but then also the individual groups that they're working on different kinds of audits and improving those. When you mentioned the computerization to the CPA a exam, I always think of the internationalization of the CPA exam. It seems as if for a while we've been expanding it to, I'm hearing from people all around the world who are saying, I'm a CPA, and I'm like, how did you become a CPA in the Palestinian Territories or so on? I mean, these are big changes in expansions.

Barry Melancon (19:33):
The number one volume space internationally today is India. And so yeah, we all over the world with it, not in China, but else, pretty much everywhere else in the world. And that's the attractiveness to the US CPA on a global stage.

Dan Hood (19:47):
There you go. Very exciting. We talked about Enron. WorldCom profession also made it pretty well through the pandemic. I think it's another, it's recent enough that we think of it's recent history, but some point it will become full on history. And it's worth, I think, talking about a little bit about the profession's role, not just in surviving it and making it through and Alzheimer, but as a first responder and the institute in particular playing a major role inside the beltway response to the pandemics. Maybe you could just take us through that a little bit.

Barry Melancon (20:14):
Yeah, that was very interesting time. I always say that the history books of Covid probably won't include a chapter on the profession's role, but they should. And frankly, we were very, our profession, when I say we, I'm not talking about the institute per se, but institute differently. We did have a role in that, but the men and women on the front lines, particularly in firms, particularly firms servicing small business, were just incredible. And we took a lot of risk on that because the government was lethargic by the nature of government with a lot of things that were pretty interesting. And I tell this story because it's not something that I think anyone would've ever predicted in my 30 year career that I would've ever said. But we were quite upfront saying to the government, look, and this specifically was related to PPP, you need to do this fast and you need to accept fraud in the process.

(21:07):

Because if you try to build a system that's going to minimize fraud to the degree that we probably would all agree should be minimization, we're going to be late. The government's response is going to be late, and the economy is going to suffer, and you have to take that risk. And we took that risk with the government. And as you recall, Dan, there were a lot of things that were unanswered. And we told our members, look, the government's not going to answer this. Here's how we would answer it, and we'll defend you because you're going to follow what we're saying on that particular spot. And sort of the collective effort of the men and women on the front lines and what we were willing to do, I think paid huge dividends to the entrepreneurial businesses of America. And we really weathered that storm extraordinarily well.

Dan Hood (21:57):
Yeah, no, there's no question the profession came out of it in a better position, but everybody that they worked with came out in a better position for having worked with them. So yeah, it's definitely a success story. It probably won't go into history books, as you say, but we'll know what everyone did. We'll know what the accountants did. Just as a sort of final wrap up, any sort of overarching thoughts on how the profession has changed in the last 30 years? We talked a little bit earlier about how you mentioned that there are firms out there that are getting pioneering, that are exploring new things, that are taking a more expansive view. Any other major changes you see in accounting?

Barry Melancon (22:32):
Well, overall, I think the profession is much more progressive. I think it's much more agile. You have a wide variety of business models today inside of firms. I think that the skill sets and competencies inside corporate America and finance functions has changed dramatically. Clearly. We're seeing different ownership structures that are pretty prevalent with the private equity era, if you want to call it that. We've shifted the generational leadership aspect pretty smoothly as a profession compared to what a lot of people were predicting maybe a decade or so ago that was going to be very difficult to do. The next generation has been phenomenal. And stepping up to leadership positions in the profession, I think you mentioned some of the quality. We've identified quality areas that needed to be focused on, and yes, that's painful sometimes, but the profession has stepped up and we haven't talked about tax, frankly, our market positioning as a profession in tax, which is not a reserve service.

(23:34):

It's a marketplace permissioning. As I said earlier. Our profession does a remarkable job in that area, including some pretty complex things, a lot of change management in that process. And really what we're seeing change, and we've been talking about this for a decade or so, is that the tax return, which for this sort of newer generation, is viewed as a byproduct of a broader notion of tax and personal planning, life planning. I'm not saying just financial planning as an investments, a broader notion of that planning has shifted very dramatically and clearly those firms that are super successful in the tax area, those who approach it as the tax return is a byproduct. Now, of course, we still face the notion of heavy workloads. We have, hopefully, when we see a tax act in 2025, we'll see that what we call the Safe Act, which changes the individual extension process. We've been working on that for a long time. So it's not a perfect panacea by any stretch of the imagination. But tax practice has evolved dramatically, and we've grown market share as a profession and the complexity and actually the global and multi-state elements of tax are right in the sweet spot of our profession and are really critical today. And that's been part of a past decade of evolution.
