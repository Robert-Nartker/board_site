00:00:00.830 [Music]
00:00:03.319 it's the accounting influencers podcast
00:00:05.940 we are broadcasting live from accountex
00:00:07.980 2023 here in London Martin Bissett is
00:00:11.340 alongside me we are wrapping up day one
00:00:13.559 of one of the world's biggest events for
00:00:15.780 the accounting and fintech World Martin
00:00:18.060 we did a pre-event show this morning
00:00:19.980 just before thousands of accountants
00:00:22.500 bookkeepers fintech professionals
00:00:25.019 descended on this big arena in London
00:00:26.939 and we preface what might be coming up
00:00:29.220 how's it been for you it has been hectic
00:00:31.560 I think the best thing about the first
00:00:34.680 day the first day is always the
00:00:36.480 strongest day theoretically okay
00:00:39.120 um and it is a 20 bigger show as we said
00:00:41.940 this morning but it's felt as busy which
00:00:44.700 suggests more people we've just spoken
00:00:46.980 to the production team the numbers are
00:00:48.420 not in yet the pre-registrations were
00:00:51.120 the biggest they ever were okay of all
00:00:53.640 time so the show rate is yet to be
00:00:56.579 declared my own personal estimate which
00:00:58.800 was done very scientifically like that
00:01:01.680 um
00:01:02.340 maybe four and a half though today
00:01:04.379 showed up
00:01:06.360 um that's bigger than Eurovision isn't
00:01:07.799 it might be bigger than Eurovision yes
00:01:09.600 indeed and what's fascinating is I have
00:01:12.960 seen accountants in practices were
00:01:14.700 expecting I have seen heads of
00:01:17.460 associations and networks which you
00:01:19.320 don't normally see here
00:01:21.659 um I have seen absolutely packed out
00:01:24.240 audiences uh in the main stages now the
00:01:27.360 main stage is 175 so for that to be full
00:01:30.360 and standing room only means audiences
00:01:32.280 of over 200 at single shows and it had
00:01:35.040 their account exposed we talked about
00:01:36.360 this morning it's had that Crescendo
00:01:37.680 Buzz so it has been an extremely strong
00:01:41.280 first day I'll wait for official figures
00:01:43.619 to come in
00:01:45.060 um I've spoken to a number of vendors
00:01:46.500 who are delighted with footfall
00:01:49.680 um and as usual the accountants have
00:01:51.360 gone
00:01:52.200 a lot here isn't there so I think we
00:01:54.720 have a stimulus issue there well it's
00:01:56.399 not just about the numbers is it you're
00:01:58.020 indicating there at the quality of
00:02:00.479 people and the different kinds of people
00:02:02.040 that are coming yeah I've heard from
00:02:04.020 vendors about the quality of
00:02:06.299 conversations that they're having yes as
00:02:08.459 well have you picked that up yeah I have
00:02:10.080 I have picked that up you always wonder
00:02:11.580 if it's all about the swag for some
00:02:13.379 people
00:02:14.700 um but no a huge a huge amount of
00:02:17.099 payroll here yeah a huge amount of
00:02:19.260 Outsourcing here and interestingly
00:02:21.660 audiences at every one of them so enough
00:02:24.480 to go around enough to share yes quality
00:02:27.060 conversations firms who appear to be in
00:02:29.280 a situation where they say
00:02:31.200 let's get serious about our practice now
00:02:33.239 let's Outsource the things we really
00:02:34.739 can't Source
00:02:36.900 um and the amount of outsources here
00:02:38.580 suggests to me that recruitment is the
00:02:40.140 problem as well we learned last year
00:02:42.959 when we were the broadcast Partners how
00:02:45.420 collaborative the vendors are and I've
00:02:47.640 picked that up too that they are talking
00:02:49.080 to each other
00:02:50.280 sometimes this competition they
00:02:52.080 certainly overlap in scope of what
00:02:54.660 they're providing for accountants but
00:02:56.280 they are very open to conversations
00:02:58.739 ostensibly to serve the accounting
00:03:00.720 profession better but to line their own
00:03:03.000 pockets and create new Revenue make the
00:03:06.000 pie bigger for everybody yeah I I think
00:03:08.160 so I mean if we look out here we can't
00:03:09.780 quite see it on camera but iris is right
00:03:11.459 next door to Sage now there isn't a
00:03:13.440 direct conflict there but nevertheless
00:03:16.260 the Irish audience is going to be of
00:03:18.120 interest the sage Stan that's for sure
00:03:19.680 and vice versa so I think over overall
00:03:23.159 a high level of engagements which you
00:03:25.080 would hope it's the case somebody came
00:03:27.239 up to me and said is this an exposure a
00:03:29.400 conference oh and it's both because
00:03:31.860 around the edges around the side around
00:03:33.480 the borders it's a conference all the
00:03:35.819 theaters are on the outside of this um
00:03:37.920 in the middle it's an expo and that's
00:03:40.500 what makes it unique you're here for
00:03:42.180 education but you're also here for
00:03:44.340 technology and you may have been to
00:03:46.080 events not as big as this but even
00:03:48.720 accountex and the theaters are not full
00:03:50.700 yes but today we saw that pretty much
00:03:54.659 every theater was maxed out so we saw a
00:03:57.780 lot of Standing Room onlys uh I'll give
00:03:59.459 a shout out to the app advisory plus
00:04:01.080 theater who had a tremendous amount of
00:04:04.799 uh loyalty from the audience towards
00:04:07.739 anything they were putting out that was
00:04:09.299 strong uh main stage five was extremely
00:04:12.180 strong today I saw that a number of
00:04:13.500 times and I I noticed that the dates for
00:04:16.139 accounting is 2024 have been announced
00:04:18.060 and sure they're all signed up for
00:04:19.738 already and test Testament to you and
00:04:23.639 the account extreme for curating such a
00:04:26.940 strong educational program I know you've
00:04:28.560 helped them with that in saying what
00:04:29.880 topics are really going to resonate with
00:04:31.620 this audience yeah I think we're going
00:04:32.699 to look at that right I think we're
00:04:33.840 going to give all the Creator team that
00:04:34.979 I was involved initially
00:04:37.020 um but um I think the team are standing
00:04:39.180 on their own two feet now and I think
00:04:41.400 they are they have done a tremendous job
00:04:43.919 in expanding the scope of subjects
00:04:47.340 um we didn't have a huge mental health
00:04:49.580 representation last time we've got maybe
00:04:52.440 five or six sessions on it this time
00:04:55.800 um and it interests me what's
00:04:57.600 interesting people what they are going
00:04:59.220 to because you've got your core food
00:05:00.720 groups yeah you know we have you
00:05:02.940 interviewed Sharon this morning and
00:05:04.860 Sharon packed out hers for the 10 tax
00:05:07.680 considerations of 23 24. you're always
00:05:10.259 going to get an audience for that
00:05:11.160 account X but then you've got a little
00:05:13.500 bit more offbeat quirky topics that are
00:05:15.960 also getting audiences I said this last
00:05:18.120 year I'll say it again the audience is
00:05:19.860 changing
00:05:20.820 you know the audience and the context
00:05:22.620 has gone by were what you might regard
00:05:24.900 as a stereotypical accountants a male in
00:05:29.240 later middle age and uh probably not a
00:05:33.300 fitness fanatic either wandering around
00:05:35.639 at things picking up swag and what you
00:05:38.100 see out there is you see a full cross
00:05:41.100 section a very strong female
00:05:43.259 representation which is getting stronger
00:05:45.060 every single year
00:05:47.160 um a whole range of Ages this time
00:05:49.979 around and practitioners who don't look
00:05:53.400 like a traditional if there is such a
00:05:55.680 thing practitioner
00:05:57.120 the accounting was changing up it's
00:05:59.160 changing I'm chairing a panel tomorrow
00:06:00.660 with on women in accounting yeah
00:06:03.180 Caroline Plum is there yeah and uh Julia
00:06:06.360 Panic from ICA yeah Natasha frankos
00:06:08.580 who's a senior partner at Hayes McIntyre
00:06:10.979 okay and we will be discussing some of
00:06:13.440 those topics but yeah a panel like that
00:06:15.600 a few years ago
00:06:17.340 you might have got it on the roster but
00:06:19.500 to get it filled exactly that's a main
00:06:21.960 theater yeah and there'll be a very
00:06:23.400 strong audience for it as well you'll
00:06:24.900 have a strong audience for that panel
00:06:26.039 because the the demographic of this
00:06:28.039 attendee list wants to hear that content
00:06:30.539 so any light bulb moments do you you got
00:06:33.419 around some of the sessions you've had
00:06:34.979 lots of conversations today yeah stuck
00:06:37.979 out for you maybe not a specific light
00:06:40.620 ball moment a lot of Insider information
00:06:42.120 kicking around lots of you do keep a lot
00:06:44.460 of secret smarter we can't broadcast and
00:06:46.380 some of the things I've been told today
00:06:48.419 um but I think if I was to take if I was
00:06:50.819 to give a one takeaway
00:06:53.699 is is that the pie is getting bigger
00:06:55.440 yeah the opportunities are getting
00:06:56.819 bigger practitioners are coming in
00:06:58.560 earlier the tech is going faster cheaper
00:07:01.620 and so on the overall experience of
00:07:04.259 accounting is changing in an
00:07:07.020 evolutionary way not changing in a
00:07:09.680 increased legislation so we've now got
00:07:11.699 to do this way it's changing in an
00:07:13.560 evolutionary way and and as we're
00:07:15.479 talking here I'm looking by you out to
00:07:17.699 the to the the floor and I'm seeing
00:07:19.500 who's walking past it's a it's a very
00:07:21.539 broad cross-section yeah I'm also going
00:07:23.759 to sense that there are a lot of new
00:07:25.259 players here yes yes all got the
00:07:27.539 incumbents yes and the other presence
00:07:29.699 yes but there's a lot of startups
00:07:31.740 there's a lot of fintechs out there's a
00:07:33.240 lot of people looking to get a foothold
00:07:34.860 yes in this world and people fronting up
00:07:38.819 with an accountex stand and a presence
00:07:40.860 let alone all the new speakers that are
00:07:43.259 coming in yes so it's a very fluid space
00:07:45.900 and low barrier to entry per beta's
00:07:48.960 pre-revenue companies startups all in
00:07:51.360 here all trying to get people's
00:07:53.160 attention because they know know that
00:07:54.419 this is a who's who yeah they know to
00:07:56.220 come here if they want to get a foothold
00:07:57.840 in the accounting model yeah now let's
00:07:59.460 look briefly ahead to tomorrow yep uh
00:08:01.680 you'll be looking different I understand
00:08:03.000 maybe there's a rumor going around but
00:08:05.460 wasn't too much about that just now
00:08:06.660 we'll wait to see what tomorrow brings
00:08:07.919 on that one okay and in terms of the

00:08:17.580 mindset that's brand new I like that
00:08:20.039 very much
00:08:21.240 um there's probably the main stages that
00:08:24.900 are interest me tomorrow
