00:00:03.840 key trends bits of commentary and
00:00:06.060 insights that are happening in the
00:00:07.259 accounting profession I'm here with my
00:00:08.700 guest uh and co-host Martin visit Martin
00:00:11.519 we talk a lot about the great
00:00:13.019 resignation the talent shortage the
00:00:15.839 labor Gap all kinds of things going on
00:00:17.880 quiet quitting uh these are myths in
00:00:20.820 some people's eyes and not really the
00:00:22.619 case to speak some truth to us well I'm
00:00:25.500 gonna the queue here from a newsletter
00:00:29.039 that I received I won't name whose
00:00:31.019 newsletter it is uh but as a well-known
00:00:33.120 consultant who is a superb probably uh
00:00:37.500 top of markets a consultant and they
00:00:40.079 produce an update every month and then
00:00:41.940 in this month's update they wrote The
00:00:43.920 Following I'm quoting directly from the
00:00:45.300 newsletter uh issue the memes that is
00:00:48.239 don't get caught in the whirlpool of
00:00:50.280 great resignation quietly quitting toxic
00:00:52.860 work environments and all the rest of
00:00:54.840 this nonsense I've already seen remote
00:00:57.600 delivery consultants and great
00:00:59.280 resignation coaches uh look for business
00:01:02.280 people don't leave organizations they
00:01:05.159 leave individuals look for the patterns
00:01:07.799 to determine who are driving people away
00:01:11.119 help your clients reward people who
00:01:15.180 Excel and provide negative consequences
00:01:17.880 for people who don't bother to do more
00:01:19.560 than the minimum organizations exist to
00:01:22.200 have customers not to solely have
00:01:24.360 employees who demand that every
00:01:26.759 grievance be satisfied
00:01:28.500 unemployment in the US here that we've
00:01:30.840 been referred to is virtually zero and
00:01:33.000 everyone is advised is yet advertising
00:01:35.579 for staff don't be hiring bodies just to
00:01:39.420 fill positions find competent people who
00:01:42.000 are enthusiastic and can be properly
00:01:43.799 educated
00:01:45.420 great resignation which they call an
00:01:47.700 existential jailbreak were real
00:01:49.979 there are going to be a lot of people
00:01:51.240 sleeping in their parents basements or
00:01:53.520 friends couches
00:01:55.100 close quotes now the reason why I
00:01:57.540 thought this was fascinating is because
00:01:58.860 we put this to our group
00:02:00.720 and to see what their responses were
00:02:04.380 and a couple of responses that
00:02:07.200 interested me right from a couple of our
00:02:09.660 members
00:02:11.520 um is to ask a different type of
00:02:13.800 question so one of our members said why
00:02:15.360 don't we change that question rather
00:02:16.620 than people leave individuals
00:02:18.660 why would someone want you
00:02:21.300 as their leader
00:02:23.520 okay and they said this is a great
00:02:25.080 question that we're being asked now for
00:02:26.280 me this is the what
00:02:28.080 so when it when the accounting firms go
00:02:30.599 out and hire they're usually looking for
00:02:32.280 a qualified usually if they're looking
00:02:33.540 for a number of years qualified usually
00:02:35.459 in order to sit in a cubicle usually in
00:02:37.560 order to churn out what is ultimately
00:02:39.599 quite boring work then the complain
00:02:43.260 there's no people no good people
00:02:45.720 well my question would be why would good
00:02:48.420 people apply for a role like that yeah
00:02:52.140 why would good people want you not you
00:02:55.440 Rob but our audience you as a boss
00:02:58.319 why would good people come to a place
00:03:01.440 where there's no clear career path why
00:03:03.660 would good people leave a good job
00:03:06.180 because the good people remember so
00:03:07.620 they're probably already in a good job
00:03:08.819 to come across to you
00:03:11.459 so I we're going to call this episode
00:03:14.099 The Great resignation of the myths you
00:03:16.500 know one of the myths in accounting is
00:03:18.780 that you know recruitment is so
00:03:20.340 difficult
00:03:21.599 and the audience should check back at me
00:03:23.519 and said no Martin it's not a myth all
00:03:25.080 of us are suffering from that yeah but
00:03:26.879 why because there are no good people in
00:03:29.760 accounting or that the good people in
00:03:31.920 the accounting don't want to leave where
00:03:33.480 they are right now to come to you and
00:03:36.120 your job because you and your job stinks
00:03:39.480 in comparison to what they're already
00:03:40.920 doing yeah and I think that's the myth
00:03:44.040 we keep getting said we can't hire
00:03:46.019 there's no people or there's no good
00:03:47.760 people that's the myth Rob there are
00:03:50.280 plenty of good people I meet with them
00:03:51.959 in the rank and file of the client
00:03:54.000 organizations I work with every single
00:03:56.099 week they're just not looking to come to
00:03:58.140 your firm because your firm's offer
00:04:00.000 isn't very attractive that's the brutal
00:04:02.099 truth isn't it the great resignation is
00:04:04.140 essentially the great reshuffle the
00:04:05.640 recalibration where people assess what
00:04:07.680 they have in their hand
00:04:09.659 and look across the garden fence if you
00:04:12.420 like and see if there's anything better
00:04:13.500 so they become more critical of the
00:04:15.599 culture that they're in if the people
00:04:16.738 are working with and the people they're
00:04:18.000 working for and they make hard decisions
00:04:20.519 now if they are going to quiet quit or
00:04:23.400 deep out of the profession come out of
00:04:25.919 employment which is a courageous move
00:04:27.360 they will be on their parents in the
00:04:29.580 parents basement at some point because
00:04:31.440 they've got to own a living somewhere
00:04:33.320 but the message here is if you want to
00:04:37.800 satisfy the tyranny of choice which is
00:04:39.840 if people need what you do why should
00:04:42.479 they come to you first above me under
00:04:44.040 all of their other choices including the
00:04:45.840 choice you do nothing if you want to
00:04:47.220 satisfy the tyranny of choice then how
00:04:49.199 are you the standout employer for what
00:04:52.020 you do so that you keep your good people
00:04:53.540 and the good people from other firms
00:04:55.860 will come over to you in return
00:04:58.259 there are great people and good people
00:05:01.259 of what there generally isn't being
00:05:03.360 advertised are great positions and good
00:05:06.120 positions great Futures and good Futures
00:05:09.540 great compensation packages and good
00:05:11.940 compensation packages great bosses and
00:05:14.520 good bosses and okay bosses great
00:05:16.620 cultures and okay cultures exactly
00:05:19.380 that's then there's the myth not
00:05:21.479 recruitment is the issue is the
00:05:22.680 opportunity there's the issue the
00:05:24.240 problem though Martin just to finish
00:05:25.620 this off is that firms get too close to
00:05:27.419 their own height their own website their
00:05:28.979 own values their own promises that they
00:05:30.960 think they're doing a great job and
00:05:33.180 because particularly in the senior
00:05:34.680 partner level they're locked in with
00:05:36.660 Equity or they've been there years and
00:05:38.400 they don't know anything different they
00:05:39.720 think why wouldn't somebody want to work
00:05:41.759 for us what are we doing wrong I'm quite
00:05:44.100 happy here what am I not seeing or worse
00:05:47.280 that thought doesn't even cross their
00:05:48.660 mind not even aware of what it's like to
00:05:51.180 work at their firm to ever consider
00:05:53.039 whether or not someone will come across
00:05:54.780 or not which is an even worse state of
00:05:57.600 ignorance but bottom line is there for
00:06:00.539 all of our listeners it's
00:06:03.300 probably you it's probably not them
00:06:07.440 great insights Martin and we will put
00:06:10.139 that out there to accountants on the
00:06:13.020 bottom end of it to say if you are going
00:06:15.840 to recalibrate your working environment
00:06:17.580 ask yourself are you working in a good
00:06:20.160 or a great firm and if you are at the
00:06:22.800 top in recruitment positions or
00:06:24.600 leadership roles then equally ask
00:06:26.340 yourself the question is you're offering
00:06:28.500 a good one or a great one and are you
00:06:31.259 contributing to the great resignation by
00:06:33.600 not being a great manager a great boss a
00:06:35.819 great place to learn Martin thanks so
00:06:38.100 much for your insights today that's a
00:06:39.419 good day
