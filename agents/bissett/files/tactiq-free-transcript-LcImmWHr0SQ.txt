00:00:00.760 [Applause]
00:00:07.359 and so i'm here with my partner in crime
00:00:09.440 and colleague and co-host on the
00:00:10.800 accounting influencers podcast for this
00:00:12.480 special guest interview it's the
00:00:13.840 wonderful martin bisic good day to you
00:00:15.519 sir good day to you rob i am all of
00:00:17.520 those things aren't i you're all of
00:00:19.119 those you're the guru you're the cliche
00:00:20.880 of amazon you've graced so many stages
00:00:23.359 and you've been that go-to expert for so
00:00:25.279 many years and it's good to do a deep
00:00:27.039 dive with you on a few things now rather
00:00:28.720 than the occasional little rants and
00:00:31.199 news updates and here's what works so
00:00:33.360 are you ready for that oh i'm ready for
00:00:34.960 that good but don't call me not a guru
00:00:36.559 guru no cliche yes but not guru that's
00:00:39.120 for sure you know it's weird to be on
00:00:41.040 the side of the desk this time and be
00:00:42.800 the the subjects rather than the the
00:00:45.600 interrogators so yep i'm ready to go rob
00:00:47.840 you fire ahead and it is a strange one
00:00:49.600 isn't it because you've appeared on many
00:00:50.960 podcasts and been asked things martin
00:00:53.280 likewise i appear on a number of
00:00:54.879 podcasts to talk about various topics
00:00:57.360 like uh talent and succession and
00:00:59.440 business development and growth for
00:01:00.719 accounting firms so we've got expertise
00:01:02.800 in our own right that people don't often
00:01:04.959 see and hear about in the accounting
00:01:06.479 influencers podcast so it's a chance for
00:01:08.640 you to shine a little bit more
00:01:10.560 my goodness i've waited my whole life
00:01:12.159 for this moment this has been exciting
00:01:14.799 well let's just start off for the
00:01:15.840 benefit of people that don't probably
00:01:17.439 know what you do
00:01:18.960 just give them a 30-second background
00:01:21.040 martin of what you've been doing for 24
00:01:23.119 years in the accounting and fintech
00:01:24.640 world
00:01:25.520 so a 24-year veteran of working in the
00:01:27.840 profession but not being of the
00:01:29.119 profession so i'm not a qualified
00:01:31.040 accountant and i never will be
00:01:32.799 but i have had perhaps more exposure
00:01:34.799 than most to
00:01:36.479 what is said and thought about in a
00:01:38.479 managing partner's office at eight
00:01:39.600 o'clock at night once the staff have
00:01:40.720 gone home
00:01:41.759 uh and all the concerns political
00:01:43.680 operational uh and growth related of
00:01:46.399 accounting firms uh throughout the world
00:01:49.119 in fact 44 different countries in total
00:01:51.520 um and six of the seven continents as
00:01:54.000 well so
00:01:55.360 i like to think that i bring
00:01:58.079 first of all one of the few independent
00:02:00.079 perspectives
00:02:01.759 um to the table and also one that is
00:02:04.399 perhaps more qualified by experience
00:02:07.680 than a lot of the voices that are out
00:02:10.479 there so you know it's all about track
00:02:12.000 record for me um so uh
00:02:15.200 developed as a director of another of
00:02:17.840 somebody else's organization delivering
00:02:20.239 lead gen for accountants graduated to my
00:02:22.959 own organization of being a consultant
00:02:24.800 speaker author internet marketing cliche
00:02:28.319 and then developed from 2018 onwards
00:02:31.920 assets
00:02:33.040 for the accounting profession so here i
00:02:34.640 am today as the owner or co-owner of
00:02:37.040 several assets serving the profession
00:02:39.200 all designed to deliver the mission of
00:02:41.440 bringing financial literacy to business
00:02:43.200 owners via the accountants because it's
00:02:45.280 the accountants that have the financial
00:02:47.200 intimacy with the business owner nicely
00:02:50.560 said but way more than 30 seconds sorry
00:02:52.720 about that but that's okay
00:02:54.720 so you've seen you've got longevity in
00:02:57.360 this game you've seen a certain amount
00:02:59.599 of change i won't say a lot of change
00:03:01.280 over the years because the accounting
00:03:02.560 profession is not known for its ability
00:03:04.640 to change but
00:03:05.920 talk to us about the
00:03:07.760 generations that you've often mentioned
00:03:10.000 to me privately about these waves of
00:03:12.720 accountants that have come through
00:03:14.720 and what that looks like for the
00:03:16.319 outsider or even someone in the
00:03:17.680 profession
00:03:18.959 yeah i did a video a while back called
00:03:20.560 generation three and the point of the
00:03:22.159 video was will this be the generation
00:03:23.920 that gets its finger out yeah yeah uh
00:03:26.239 and what i meant by that typically you
00:03:28.080 know uh provoking as usual but but what
00:03:30.720 i meant by that was that
00:03:33.200 i
00:03:34.000 sat in all these offices that i talked
00:03:35.280 about i was managing partners offices
00:03:36.560 and listening to plans and dreams and
00:03:38.319 goals and we're going to do this next
00:03:39.519 year and so on and i've seen two
00:03:41.519 generations there of of managing
00:03:43.440 partners or sole practitioners
00:03:46.560 retire having achieved nothing that they
00:03:49.920 said they were going to so basically
00:03:51.440 what their career can be summed up like
00:03:53.120 this they weren't too many hours for too
00:03:54.799 little money got enough in the pension
00:03:56.239 and left
00:03:57.599 and that's the sum total of somebody's
00:03:59.040 professional life
00:04:00.720 you know and
00:04:01.840 anybody listening to this i would hope
00:04:03.200 would push back and say ah but what
00:04:04.480 about all the clients what about all the
00:04:06.319 stories
00:04:07.280 well yeah that's exactly right
00:04:09.760 those people did help a huge number of
00:04:12.239 businesses they have got a lot of
00:04:14.400 stories and exactly none of them are
00:04:16.880 recorded with posterity so we don't know
00:04:19.680 about them so what was the point of them
00:04:21.040 happening
00:04:21.918 you know so
00:04:24.080 what i see now
00:04:26.240 is i see
00:04:27.680 a
00:04:28.560 a generation of accountants who've been
00:04:30.080 trained the same as all the rest
00:04:32.400 but have a different different level of
00:04:33.759 aspiration so rather than i'll work 25
00:04:35.919 years off the firm become a partner and
00:04:37.360 then become rich and then that's me
00:04:38.479 sorted
00:04:39.600 i have a different level of aspirations
00:04:41.120 where the vision or mission of an
00:04:43.520 accounting firm that they work for
00:04:44.880 actually matters to them is actually
00:04:46.160 part of the decision making behavior a
00:04:48.240 commercial desire exists to understand
00:04:50.560 how to run a business not be an
00:04:52.479 accountant in the accounting practice
00:04:54.560 there is a much greater grip on
00:04:56.960 technology
00:04:58.479 than there was in generations gone by
00:05:00.560 where there was a resistance to change
00:05:02.720 in technology so i see a difference now
00:05:05.680 i see a younger hungrier
00:05:08.800 more open-minded
00:05:11.039 more ambitious and more diverse
00:05:13.919 accounting um
00:05:16.160 cohort shall we say than i have seen in
00:05:18.479 generations gone by we're not just
00:05:19.680 talking about
00:05:20.800 uh 55 year old uh fat white rich people
00:05:23.520 anymore
00:05:25.120 but is that symptomatic of the evolution
00:05:27.520 of the profession and how they've
00:05:28.960 adapted to change and become more
00:05:30.560 commercial or is that symptomatic of
00:05:32.800 generations generally the millennials
00:05:34.800 the gen zeds
00:05:36.240 they are more like that they do push
00:05:38.080 back a lot more they do have hopefully
00:05:39.840 better critical thinking skills they
00:05:41.840 won't just be chained to a desk for 10
00:05:43.600 to 15 years and expect to make partner
00:05:45.840 they want more and they want to give
00:05:47.440 more
00:05:48.639 two things i think it's the latter i
00:05:50.479 think it's far more generational
00:05:52.720 behavioral difference yeah but the other
00:05:55.039 thing that it is that you didn't mention
00:05:56.639 there um is that university has become
00:05:59.520 more available to more people and more
00:06:02.240 social economic subsets over the last 25
00:06:04.479 years which has brought a different mix
00:06:06.560 of people
00:06:07.759 into the profession and qualified far
00:06:10.160 more female leaders far more minority
00:06:12.960 professionals and so on who have shown
00:06:15.680 their abilities then in practice and
00:06:18.479 been promoted or built their own firms
00:06:20.720 accordingly so i think it's a mixture of
00:06:23.520 a generational change and also the
00:06:26.479 further education being available and
00:06:28.960 being seen as achievable and desirable
00:06:32.560 by far more than the
00:06:35.280 normal perhaps again middle class of
00:06:38.000 england that we've seen previously in
00:06:39.600 the middle class of the us or anywhere
00:06:41.280 so i don't think accountants is
00:06:42.639 necessarily a middle class game anymore
00:06:45.440 and i think practice technology has
00:06:48.080 allowed people to become far more
00:06:51.280 i'm gonna say digital in their thinking
00:06:53.120 so it's broken geographical boundaries
00:06:55.440 you don't have a client base that's
00:06:56.639 within 25 miles of your office anymore
00:06:59.520 it's changed the way pricing worked it's
00:07:01.599 changed the way interaction with the
00:07:02.880 client works and as a result you've got
00:07:05.199 different people delivering it on that
00:07:06.560 basis the typical
00:07:08.319 traditional words that we use accounting
00:07:10.800 firm
00:07:11.840 perhaps is less prevalent these days
00:07:14.639 than it was certainly when i first came
00:07:16.319 in
00:07:17.120 but going back to the accounting
00:07:18.400 qualification that you touched on that's
00:07:20.080 not changed much double entry
00:07:21.599 bookkeeping is double entry bookkeeping
00:07:23.680 we could almost ask is that fit for
00:07:26.160 purpose because if nothing's changed
00:07:28.560 you're churning out the same kind of
00:07:30.319 accountants with the same kind of
00:07:31.759 qualifications and the same kind of
00:07:33.919 thinking into a world that has changed
00:07:35.919 drastically from what it was 30 50 100
00:07:38.800 years ago absolutely depends on the
00:07:40.720 purpose if the purpose is to prepare
00:07:42.240 someone to work into a cubicle for 30
00:07:44.319 years it is fit for purpose yeah
00:07:47.199 but it doesn't teach commercial
00:07:49.360 um
00:07:50.560 commercial awareness
00:07:52.720 it it doesn't teach business development
00:07:55.199 it doesn't teach marketing all of which
00:07:57.039 have become far more
00:07:58.720 forefront skills
00:08:00.319 in the 21st century practice
00:08:02.639 so
00:08:03.840 does it build a commercial business
00:08:06.000 owner that happens to be in the
00:08:08.639 accounting profession no the
00:08:10.080 qualifications don't do that they're a
00:08:11.440 technical qualification they show you
00:08:13.360 how to do the job and as such
00:08:15.759 it hasn't changed much and it's only fit
00:08:18.319 for purpose if your intention is to
00:08:20.080 simply
00:08:21.039 practice the profession of accounting
00:08:23.759 your entire career if you want to build
00:08:25.120 a business that's a different set of
00:08:26.160 skills
00:08:27.039 we've touched in previous podcasts on
00:08:29.199 the problem with the labor shortage in
00:08:31.440 the accounting and finance profession
00:08:33.679 we've talked about the baby boomers
00:08:35.440 retiring the older people moving on less
00:08:38.799 people coming into the profession
00:08:41.039 so whilst there may be different kinds
00:08:43.599 of new generational accountants coming
00:08:46.160 through there are certainly less of them
00:08:48.959 is a trend over the generations you've
00:08:50.959 seen that accountancy is less attractive
00:08:54.000 to people coming in than it perhaps once
00:08:56.160 was
00:08:57.279 no the talent shortage has been going on
00:08:59.519 forever okay um i remember talking about
00:09:02.480 talent shortages over 15 years ago
00:09:05.200 um and there are there's two major
00:09:07.360 factors for that there's a difference to
00:09:08.720 be made there's a
00:09:10.320 a distinguished
00:09:12.160 uh distinction to be made between
00:09:14.640 a being able to hire someone and be able
00:09:17.680 to hire someone who's any good
00:09:20.240 you know those two things are different
00:09:21.519 and i think just about any business
00:09:23.040 would tell you that it's not difficult
00:09:24.800 to find people it's difficult to find
00:09:26.399 good people right uh according to that
00:09:28.480 criteria so i think that's the first
00:09:30.320 thing
00:09:31.360 um
00:09:32.480 and i think the other thing was that
00:09:34.160 certainly in the case of university
00:09:36.320 graduates the big four in any given
00:09:38.880 territory have always
00:09:40.320 cast a big fishing net
00:09:42.720 and sweeps everybody up long before a
00:09:45.120 mid-sized practice would get anywhere
00:09:46.480 near knowing about them
00:09:48.640 and then spat out the ones they don't
00:09:50.080 like and kept the ones that they wanted
00:09:52.800 therefore the labour market becomes the
00:09:54.320 ones that the big four didn't want or it
00:09:56.080 wasn't a fit for the big four
00:09:58.160 so i think there's that to consider the
00:09:59.839 other thing i think i would consider
00:10:02.000 is that the recruitment processes and
00:10:05.040 behaviors of accounting firms haven't
00:10:07.519 changed
00:10:09.120 so if you're going fishing in a dead
00:10:10.640 pool
00:10:12.000 then the next time you go fishing in
00:10:13.279 that pool it'll still be dead
00:10:15.440 and as such they haven't changed how
00:10:18.399 they go about attracting talent
00:10:20.399 significantly so an advert goes in a
00:10:22.959 particular paper
00:10:24.560 or on a particular website
00:10:26.560 or they ask the staff again
00:10:29.360 whether they've got any friends or
00:10:30.320 family that should join the firm and i
00:10:32.720 don't see too many firms having a
00:10:34.480 diverse approach
00:10:36.399 something that i always did in my
00:10:37.440 consulting career
00:10:38.720 was asked accounting firms to run a
00:10:41.040 pipeline of people
00:10:43.360 just like even a pipeline of prospects
00:10:45.680 so you have a pipeline prospect so you
00:10:46.880 know where the new business is coming
00:10:47.920 from well how about a pipeline of
00:10:49.279 relationships so you know where the
00:10:50.320 people are coming from yes okay they're
00:10:52.399 not ready to join you now what about
00:10:53.839 next year what about the year after okay
00:10:55.440 they're happy where they are now what
00:10:57.120 about next year what about the year
00:10:58.839 after and again
00:11:01.440 commercially organizationally
00:11:04.000 firms were never
00:11:05.600 that bothered
00:11:06.880 or that well geared up to go yeah that's
00:11:08.880 right we'll actually run a database of
00:11:10.720 people so we'll build our people
00:11:13.440 uh crm and we'll know which people are
00:11:15.680 around we'll know who's qualified over
00:11:17.200 there we'll know who's unhappy we'll
00:11:18.800 know who's moved into the area since
00:11:20.000 taking a job over there
00:11:21.519 because accountants aren't necessarily
00:11:24.160 um
00:11:25.200 extroverts they're introverts who don't
00:11:26.880 normally build relationships and
00:11:29.200 networks like that so it was very
00:11:30.480 difficult for them to have a network
00:11:31.760 like that but for me
00:11:34.240 what is what causes the talent shortage
00:11:36.800 well it's those things we mentioned plus
00:11:38.880 the lack of innovation in recruitment
00:11:41.519 techniques by the firms themselves
00:11:44.079 but when we talk about innovation the
00:11:46.240 word change does come up
00:11:48.480 we've seen no change really in the
00:11:50.000 accounting qualifications the process to
00:11:52.160 become a qualified professional in this
00:11:54.639 game have accounting firms changed much
00:11:57.680 their business models their approach
00:12:00.720 the things that they do in the ways that
00:12:02.320 they do them
00:12:04.000 again it comes down to definition of
00:12:05.519 terms change can also mean for the worse
00:12:08.320 yes and we've assumed for the better in
00:12:09.920 the question uh so have accounting firms
00:12:12.480 improved
00:12:13.600 um
00:12:14.560 yes
00:12:15.440 is it marginal yes is it normally
00:12:17.920 mandated by legislative changes yes
00:12:20.959 is there a lot of proactive change where
00:12:22.720 firm's gone we're not prepared to deal
00:12:23.920 with this anymore we're gonna make
00:12:24.880 change it's gonna be better next year
00:12:27.279 not tremendously not on mass no you find
00:12:30.639 them in pockets of course
00:12:32.320 there's a firm you know there are firms
00:12:34.079 that take a great initiative to say
00:12:35.279 we're going to stand ourselves out from
00:12:36.560 the rest of the crowd but you don't see
00:12:38.160 it as a norm of course
00:12:40.000 so um
00:12:41.360 so for me has they been improved hasn't
00:12:43.519 been changed or yes it's been changed
00:12:45.360 say what one thing hasn't changed and
00:12:47.360 that's the average fee
00:12:49.519 that accounting phone gets for
00:12:50.720 compliance work that's been static
00:12:52.240 regardless of inflation over the years
00:12:53.839 from many many firms they are charging
00:12:55.760 the same
00:12:56.800 business
00:12:58.079 um 1800 of their currency 1800 pounds or
00:13:01.680 euros or whatever now and they were
00:13:04.079 charging 1800 five years ago as well
00:13:06.720 so that hasn't changed um but i think
00:13:10.480 technology has changed we know that for
00:13:12.320 sure technology has changed um and the
00:13:15.360 thing that really got me in the first
00:13:17.680 colby lockdown rob was the
00:13:20.959 the common refrain that we heard from
00:13:24.000 accountants where they say we're so much
00:13:25.920 closer to our account to our clients now
00:13:28.959 we know what they're all about we know
00:13:30.639 what they're trying to achieve we
00:13:32.000 understand their business
00:13:33.760 and they were
00:13:35.120 promoting that as a positives and
00:13:36.480 trumpeting that as a positive and i was
00:13:37.519 thinking to myself
00:13:38.720 so does that mean that before this
00:13:40.320 global pandemic
00:13:42.160 you didn't know what your clients did
00:13:44.000 you didn't know what they wanted and you
00:13:45.360 didn't understand the business
00:13:47.279 so that's changed but that took a global
00:13:48.959 pandemic to do
00:13:50.560 well why hasn't there been change if you
00:13:53.040 look at other industries or sectors
00:13:56.160 technology making cars
00:13:58.639 restaurants have changed
00:14:00.800 bars and clubs have changed the leisure
00:14:03.440 industry's change i could pick out any
00:14:05.440 number of sectors here
00:14:07.440 professional services maybe even the
00:14:09.199 legal market the consulting market has
00:14:11.440 changed in its approach but is it a
00:14:13.600 complacency around the monthly recurring
00:14:16.959 revenues that elegantly turn up every
00:14:18.959 month what is it that is stopping the
00:14:20.800 accountants from any kind of radical
00:14:22.880 change well it's partly that yeah i mean
00:14:25.519 if you look at the drivers for change in
00:14:27.040 accounting firm what were the drivers
00:14:28.320 for change one would be intense
00:14:30.079 competition
00:14:31.760 but there isn't intense competition
00:14:33.120 there's a lot of accounting firms but
00:14:34.399 there's a lot of businesses and they're
00:14:36.160 extremely loyal right you don't
00:14:37.760 generally change your account unless you
00:14:39.360 really want to you don't do it on a whim
00:14:41.920 you don't do it the first time something
00:14:43.519 goes wrong the first time they drop the
00:14:44.800 ball you stick around because they know
00:14:46.240 a lot about you
00:14:47.680 so competition while it's a factor it's
00:14:51.120 not top of the list so it's not the
00:14:53.040 competition that necessarily drives
00:14:54.399 change significantly
00:14:56.639 is it apathy well there's a big argument
00:14:58.639 for that
00:14:59.600 because as you say lifestyle goals are
00:15:01.839 reached by by firm owners
00:15:04.079 by recurring fees
00:15:05.760 so yes it can be that but absolutely
00:15:09.760 we then look at okay so apathy yes
00:15:13.279 because of the recurring fee model
00:15:15.199 competition not so much
00:15:17.839 legislative change that's the other
00:15:19.199 thing that would drive change
00:15:20.959 when there is a law change now there
00:15:23.760 have been lots of law changes but that
00:15:26.079 generally creates a stimulus package
00:15:28.480 for accountants it generally gives them
00:15:29.920 more work to do because there's more
00:15:31.360 things the clients have to do to be
00:15:32.560 compliant
00:15:34.320 so because
00:15:36.720 the government's
00:15:38.399 and and any changes in law typically
00:15:40.880 help the accountant
00:15:42.480 because recurring fees come in and
00:15:44.720 there's very high retention rates of
00:15:46.240 clients year in year out
00:15:48.399 and because competition from other firms
00:15:50.560 isn't necessarily fierce
00:15:53.279 that's why nothing really changes
00:15:55.920 if you look at some of the
00:15:58.000 big areas that haven't changed you
00:15:59.839 touched on the average fee is very
00:16:01.680 similar we would put pricing in there
00:16:03.519 wouldn't we yeah we would put maybe
00:16:06.320 culture maybe the accounting firm
00:16:08.560 website has not changed in the last 10
00:16:11.279 20 years the marketing the way they
00:16:13.279 present themselves talk to us about some
00:16:15.680 of these things that have remained
00:16:17.680 largely static well if we pick up on the
00:16:19.759 website you find trends
00:16:22.480 somebody comes up with some gurus
00:16:24.560 back when gurus ruled the world
00:16:26.560 some guru would say something
00:16:29.199 some firm would back it up and then it
00:16:31.040 became a trend so i remember
00:16:33.279 when the term business advisors first
00:16:35.600 became like a buzzword there you go so
00:16:37.759 so all of a sudden all websites change
00:16:40.000 from so-and-so chartered accountants to
00:16:41.759 sorts of traffic accounts and business
00:16:43.680 advisors
00:16:45.040 and then some firms went absolutely
00:16:46.639 crazy about them when business advisors
00:16:49.360 and chartered accountants
00:16:51.440 and then it well the globs came off at
00:16:53.199 that point that was incredible you know
00:16:54.800 and then there was this quirky phase
00:16:57.360 where we took american australian
00:16:58.959 initiatives and influences and we said
00:17:01.279 hey it's not a receptionist it's a
00:17:03.040 director of first impressions
00:17:05.599 this person is our chief wow officer
00:17:08.959 and moronic things like that that any
00:17:11.760 clear thinking business owner sees right
00:17:13.520 through when he's not swayed by any in
00:17:15.520 any way whatsoever and it's just like
00:17:16.880 whatever you know lipstick on a pig as
00:17:19.520 it were as the phrase goes um so
00:17:22.720 so
00:17:23.599 we they've tried all those things but
00:17:25.199 it's all surface level stuff
00:17:28.240 you know you come in and you get a drink
00:17:29.679 at reception
00:17:31.840 but what's going on in the back room
00:17:33.280 well tax department's still miserable
00:17:35.200 audit department still doesn't talk to
00:17:36.640 them or trust them
00:17:38.160 nothing changes all the shirts are still
00:17:40.080 grey
00:17:40.960 the ties have come off and it's now open
00:17:43.039 neck wow
00:17:44.960 but very little has changed the
00:17:46.720 wallpaper hasn't changed so
00:17:49.200 so
00:17:50.640 various initiatives have come into the
00:17:52.080 profession starting with the boot camp
00:17:54.400 avm being the master class here in the
00:17:57.039 in the uk
00:17:58.640 round one in the us uh root works in the
00:18:02.160 u.s rainmaker in the us growth
00:18:05.200 partnership in the u.s all these ways
00:18:07.440 have have come forward to
00:18:09.440 to try and get a firm to think
00:18:11.280 differently act differently behave
00:18:12.799 differently
00:18:14.400 the leopard doesn't change its spots too
00:18:15.919 much unless it's made to
00:18:18.320 and you talk often about
00:18:20.960 things like value pricing there are new
00:18:22.960 initiatives and great opportunities for
00:18:24.799 accountants but you often say that
00:18:27.120 nothing's changed in pricing ron baker
00:18:29.360 the the godfather if you like of the
00:18:31.200 pricing conversation in the accounting
00:18:33.120 world has been saying the same things
00:18:35.039 for many years with respect to him
00:18:37.120 because of the lack of implementation of
00:18:40.000 these new initiatives
00:18:42.160 ron's an exceptionally sharp intellect
00:18:44.080 and he has written
00:18:45.840 the cutting edge on these topics in
00:18:47.679 terms of books
00:18:48.880 you ask accountants who's heard of ron
00:18:50.640 baker and a lot of people have heard of
00:18:52.400 ron baker
00:18:53.679 you asking what ron baker writes about
00:18:56.320 and they'll tell you exactly what ron
00:18:57.679 baker writes about
00:18:59.520 you asking if they've got the wrong
00:19:00.720 baker book
00:19:02.400 any one of them implementing value
00:19:04.080 pricing or whatever it happens to be or
00:19:05.360 firm in the future or so on they've got
00:19:07.440 the book you asked them if they've read
00:19:09.440 it
00:19:10.880 i've done anything with it well they
00:19:12.880 haven't read it so they can't do
00:19:13.840 anything with it no
00:19:15.280 it never gets to that point haven't read
00:19:16.880 it sat there on the bookshelf with all
00:19:18.080 the rest of them never looked at why
00:19:20.320 because change isn't an imperative
00:19:22.480 so generally when it comes to pricing we
00:19:24.720 look at pricing next
00:19:26.960 why hasn't pricing changed well because
00:19:29.679 of self-esteem predominantly
00:19:31.760 that little voice in the mind
00:19:34.480 says the client will never pay it
00:19:37.039 there's no evidence for that there's no
00:19:38.320 statistical evidence
00:19:39.919 but that's what the lack of self-esteem
00:19:41.360 says lack of self-esteem also says
00:19:45.039 uh you're not worth that
00:19:47.280 you know and we believe it so
00:19:49.760 pricing
00:19:51.280 increases
00:19:52.559 very rarely again i'm talking generally
00:19:54.480 not specifically so don't write in
00:19:56.320 listeners to say well i changed my
00:19:57.520 prices yeah i know you did the rest of
00:19:58.880 them didn't
00:19:59.760 okay
00:20:00.960 pricing doesn't generally change not
00:20:02.880 because the market won't stand it or not
00:20:05.679 because the market rejects it and not
00:20:07.760 because the market have looked at it
00:20:09.360 thought about it i'm not sure about it
00:20:12.159 but the accountant has never taken it to
00:20:13.919 market in the first place because
00:20:15.520 they're scared
00:20:16.880 that the client will say
00:20:18.559 that's a disgrace you're ripping me off
00:20:20.559 i'm leaving
00:20:22.480 but let's just go look at a firm's
00:20:23.840 retention rate 90 95 they don't leave
00:20:27.840 that's not what they do generally
00:20:29.360 speaking so
00:20:31.039 so pricing will only
00:20:33.120 increase when the accountant decides
00:20:35.520 that they're worth it the accountant
00:20:36.640 will only decide that they're worth it
00:20:38.640 when they start to collect and publish
00:20:41.440 and promote stories of the profound
00:20:43.679 impact they've had in business owners
00:20:45.039 lives
00:20:46.320 the firms that do that start to
00:20:48.159 recognize their own value and start to
00:20:49.679 increase their prices something else
00:20:51.440 that hasn't changed is the accounting
00:20:53.120 firm business model
00:20:54.799 the hierarchical structure equity
00:20:57.440 partners taking the value out of the
00:20:59.280 firm
00:21:00.640 why is that uh what another part of that
00:21:03.760 is is what members uh what accountants
00:21:05.919 could and couldn't do if you were a
00:21:07.039 member of icaw or certain u.s
00:21:09.120 institutions
00:21:10.400 up until november 2001 you couldn't
00:21:12.559 market on very many things you could
00:21:14.880 advertise and say we we exist and we're
00:21:17.760 over here
00:21:19.039 but you couldn't say why you might want
00:21:20.400 to go and talk to us on that basis
00:21:23.120 so it was very very difficult
00:21:25.840 for a firm to innovate up until 20 years
00:21:28.880 ago it was very difficult for a firm
00:21:32.320 to
00:21:33.679 um
00:21:35.360 educate a market
00:21:36.960 up until 20 years ago and because
00:21:40.080 that's that 20 years gap is relatively
00:21:43.039 new and because the owners of accounting
00:21:46.240 firms today weren't trained or
00:21:48.320 understood how to market how to sell
00:21:51.440 or to be commercial in that regard
00:21:53.760 and because recurring fees
00:21:56.799 meet the requirements of many firm
00:21:58.880 owners who aren't all that ambitious
00:22:00.240 they don't want to have an empire they
00:22:01.679 want to have a business working for
00:22:02.799 themselves
00:22:04.720 that's why things don't change because
00:22:06.640 again
00:22:07.440 the the market isn't asking for anything
00:22:09.600 new
00:22:11.120 the accounting firm owners don't know
00:22:12.559 how to provide anything new
00:22:16.080 and they get money
00:22:18.000 whether they work at 100 miles an hour
00:22:20.000 at 50 miles an hour it doesn't change so
00:22:22.400 there's very very little incentive
00:22:25.120 for anything to change there's no
00:22:26.720 economic imperative for change and as a
00:22:29.679 result the business model stays the same
00:22:32.559 so as we draw too close listeners will
00:22:35.039 be
00:22:35.919 thinking about what seems to be a
00:22:38.080 cynical view of the profession but i
00:22:39.919 know you love it dearly and you are very
00:22:41.760 passionate about
00:22:43.039 changing it where you can so give us
00:22:45.200 some hope
00:22:46.559 as we draw to an end here with some
00:22:49.039 predictions or what you would like to
00:22:50.880 see happen as we emerge from coving and
00:22:53.200 hopefully get back to
00:22:55.039 something like we did before where the
00:22:57.280 accountant held sway with the business
00:23:00.159 owner
00:23:01.840 this relatively new phenomena
00:23:04.240 of
00:23:05.360 venture capital or private equity funds
00:23:08.400 coming in
00:23:09.679 and funding the acquisition of
00:23:11.200 accounting firms
00:23:12.880 is wonderful
00:23:14.320 is that a game changer
00:23:16.080 it's a game improver okay um
00:23:19.120 and the reason why it's good is that it
00:23:20.960 forces firms to be commercial
00:23:24.159 and when you force a phone to be
00:23:25.600 commercial then you have to go out and
00:23:28.640 tell your story
00:23:30.159 when you have to go out and tell your
00:23:31.520 story you don't have to rely in an
00:23:33.679 accounting firm on hype and false claims
00:23:37.039 you can legitimately
00:23:38.960 delve into the treasure chest of your
00:23:40.799 client stories and bring out the most
00:23:42.960 wonderful the most true the most
00:23:45.200 accurate examples of improvement
00:23:48.240 in a business owner's life and so many
00:23:51.039 people rob say to me i got into
00:23:52.640 accounting to help people
00:23:55.600 and i've ended up becoming compliant
00:23:58.159 slaves nothing more than that
00:24:00.720 well commercialization of the profession
00:24:03.600 which is my little
00:24:04.960 trademark phrase for 20-22
00:24:07.520 that's that's
00:24:09.679 what's going to happen
00:24:11.120 when you commercialize an accounting
00:24:12.960 firm and turn it into an accounting
00:24:14.080 business and will farnell talks about
00:24:15.440 the difference between accounting
00:24:16.480 practice and the accounting business
00:24:18.480 when you become an accounting business
00:24:20.159 you become like every other business
00:24:22.000 that just so happens to be
00:24:24.159 in the in the market of accounting but
00:24:26.799 the beauty is that you've got something
00:24:28.799 of genuine true intrinsic value to offer
00:24:31.600 that really does
00:24:33.120 specifically
00:24:34.559 demonstrably
00:24:36.400 improve
00:24:37.600 human beings lives
00:24:39.279 and you can show it you can show how you
00:24:40.720 take the headaches away you can show how
00:24:42.799 you make the dream holiday come true how
00:24:45.039 you made the dream house come true how
00:24:47.840 you made the business empire expansion
00:24:49.760 plan come true
00:24:51.520 how you dug someone out of a hole how
00:24:54.159 you stop the marriage from breaking up
00:24:55.919 all of these outcomes are accounting

00:25:28.960 profession you've said it faithfully
00:25:31.120 over many years and you've got a few
00:25:32.720 still to go what would be your part in
00:25:34.559 words as a postcard to the profession if
00:25:37.279 you like

00:26:11.279 exactly what you've done for people they
00:26:13.760 happen to be clients but it's still
00:26:15.440 people

00:26:22.720 yourself the gift of validation

00:26:33.200 celebrate the hard work you worked hard
