00:00:26.560 in yes it's Martin Bisset on 50 minutes
00:00:31.240 behind the profile Martin good afternoon
00:00:33.440 sir good afternoon to you too Ashley how
00:00:35.719 are you I am absolutely buzzing and when
00:00:39.040 I get a guest like you in the show it
00:00:41.079 makes me even happier so uh yeah thanks
00:00:43.160 every so much for coming along today for
00:00:45.280 the no so tell those people that don't
00:00:48.559 know who you are who you are what you do
00:00:50.640 please Martin who is the old fat Block
00:00:52.680 in the suit yeah so a 26 year veteran
00:00:55.640 actually of the accounting world without
00:00:57.440 ever having been an accountant and why
00:01:00.519 spend 26 years in accountancy when you
00:01:02.320 don't have the right letters after your
00:01:03.480 name well it's a long story but the
00:01:05.760 short version is that I am someone who
00:01:10.080 wants to help and has spent those years
00:01:12.439 trying to help accountants go beyond
00:01:14.240 compliance work to get involved in their
00:01:16.360 business owners lives because that when
00:01:19.000 done correctly has tremendous personal
00:01:22.240 impact on those business owners that
00:01:24.840 cannot be achieved by the bank by the
00:01:27.600 IFA by the lawyer or even by the
00:01:30.159 management Consultants it's only
00:01:31.439 accountants that can do it so if I want
00:01:33.320 to have impact in my career that was
00:01:36.119 tangible measurable serious it was going
00:01:38.600 to have to be through accountant and so
00:01:40.479 that's the way I went perfect perfect 26
00:01:43.960 years in this in this space you don't
00:01:45.920 you don't look old enough sir I look too
00:01:47.840 old that's the problem these
00:01:50.280 days must must be the must be the
00:01:52.520 lighting so so so you're not an
00:01:55.360 accountant nope never have been will be
00:01:58.159 what draw you to this space uh generally
00:02:01.039 it was that motivation so back uh a long
00:02:03.960 time ago um my father was a very
00:02:06.880 successful businessman but a businessman
00:02:09.840 who like a lot of us and I would include
00:02:11.760 myself uh from years ago not necessarily
00:02:14.360 financially literate so great at doing
00:02:17.239 the thing that he did not great at
00:02:19.319 running a business that does the thing
00:02:21.400 yeah yeah um and we can a lot of us can
00:02:24.040 relate to that and so he grew Beyond his
00:02:26.640 ability to really uh
00:02:30.200 cope I'll call it and things went
00:02:33.239 terribly wrong and anybody who knows me
00:02:35.080 well knows this story very well anyway
00:02:36.519 so I won't go into the depth of it but
00:02:38.760 ultimately uh he lost his business and
00:02:41.239 many other things as well as a result of
00:02:44.680 the lack of assistance that was around
00:02:46.440 at that time no one's fault by the way
00:02:48.480 but the lack of assistance that was
00:02:49.640 around at that time to help owner manag
00:02:51.400 businesses and I have almost fallen down
00:02:55.560 the same uh hole myself my accountant
00:02:58.879 bailed me out
00:03:00.720 wow and then when you work out what are
00:03:03.599 you going to do with a career that
00:03:04.480 actually means anything other than
00:03:06.200 collecting a pension and a carriage
00:03:07.560 clock and thank you for your service
00:03:08.760 goodbye into retirement what are you
00:03:10.280 going to do that actually leaves
00:03:11.200 anything behind this seemed to me like a
00:03:13.519 good idea if I could get accountant to
00:03:15.920 be the ones to go and help
00:03:17.959 businesses I would have a legacy or
00:03:20.720 rather the work would have a legacy that
00:03:22.360 would last long long Beyond
00:03:24.560 me and and that that's the thing
00:03:27.000 is I totally relate to it because I'm
00:03:30.159 really good at teaching people how to do
00:03:31.519 LinkedIn but like you say I haven't a
00:03:33.159 clue we're running a business that's why
00:03:35.319 I've got an accountant to help me right
00:03:38.040 um and and and the thing is our
00:03:41.000 accountants are in an amazing position
00:03:44.480 to be able to help these small
00:03:45.519 businesses because you know not only do
00:03:48.040 they know all the numbers they know what
00:03:49.640 the numbers should do and how we should
00:03:51.159 do it so how are you helping accountants
00:03:52.840 to do that because many accountants that
00:03:55.920 we we speak to just do the compliance
00:03:58.400 and and and get stuck on that hamster
00:04:00.079 whe didn't they oh yeah yeah well in the
00:04:02.040 old days it was one to one so I I was
00:04:04.879 the archetypal internet marketing cliche
00:04:07.760 he's a speaker he's a consultant he's an
00:04:10.480 author you know that sort of thing which
00:04:12.879 everyone does um but I think I had going
00:04:17.320 by the feedback I had uh a style or an
00:04:22.079 approach that was a wee bit Marite uh
00:04:24.919 anybody overseas probably won't
00:04:26.320 recognize that reference but you were
00:04:28.560 either really fond of what I had to say
00:04:30.800 or you really not fond of what I had to
00:04:32.840 say whatsoever and I just felt that I
00:04:35.680 couldn't reach enough people I'd gone
00:04:36.919 around the world several times from a
00:04:38.479 speaking perspective and a Consulting
00:04:40.240 perspective as well and I just didn't
00:04:42.479 feel like I was making a dent um and so
00:04:45.720 six months before covid happened I
00:04:48.320 decided to explore the world of online
00:04:50.199 communities which was fairly new at that
00:04:52.080 time uh as a greater reach tool and go
00:04:55.280 from from one to to a one to many model
00:04:58.280 really and communities has become really
00:05:01.479 the bread and Butch of the business
00:05:02.960 since that time I think uh bisic group
00:05:05.120 has eight communities that it runs at
00:05:06.400 this time um and you know covering
00:05:10.199 different areas covering pricing
00:05:11.639 covering general practice covering um
00:05:14.199 fintech sector as well uh and all of
00:05:18.080 that actually has to do the same thing
00:05:19.919 is to try and get this military style
00:05:22.520 push uphill to get the accountant to
00:05:25.360 come out of the safe zone out of the
00:05:28.400 zone out of the compliance Zone and say
00:05:32.440 hey Diane we can actually help you with
00:05:33.639 that yeah or Andy how you doing you
00:05:36.319 struggling yeah let let us let's have a
00:05:38.560 chat about that because left to their
00:05:40.759 own devices that's not what happens the
00:05:43.560 client has to make the phone call and if
00:05:45.120 the client doesn't know to make the
00:05:46.440 phone call it doesn't happen at all and
00:05:49.800 the client generally sinks in that
00:05:52.680 scenario there's some there's some real
00:05:54.440 stats we'll come to this in a second I'm
00:05:56.120 just going to say hello to uh Pavo and
00:05:58.639 mial if you guys got any questions for
00:06:00.720 Martin then please put a QE in front of
00:06:03.000 um your your um question and we'll we'll
00:06:05.280 fire that at Martin and what are the
00:06:08.120 stats for businesses failing in the UK
00:06:11.400 it's pretty shocking isn't it yeah I
00:06:13.639 mean depends on which report you look at
00:06:16.319 um from one in five failing in the first
00:06:19.720 five years till three in five and there
00:06:21.440 was some report says six in five fail in
00:06:23.080 the first five years you know what's I
00:06:25.479 don't think that one's something that I
00:06:27.479 look at too much I think what I'm
00:06:28.840 concerned about is why yeah because
00:06:31.840 generally speaking people will say cash
00:06:34.520 it was underfunded okay it ran out of
00:06:36.919 cash it had no cash it was under fun in
00:06:39.400 the first place I might challenge that I
00:06:41.759 might go with self-esteem
00:06:43.919 instead because just as the accounting
00:06:46.400 profession can relate self-esteem
00:06:48.560 prevents us from actually getting out
00:06:49.840 there and creating new value creates the
00:06:52.759 it stops from getting the price that we
00:06:54.240 actually could get and deserve to get it
00:06:56.720 stops US achieving the level of
00:06:58.280 profitability that we could get and
00:07:01.000 deserve to get and if it's true of
00:07:02.520 accountants I bet you it's true of SES
00:07:03.960 as well and so I would imagine that
00:07:06.879 someone sat there going okay well I am
00:07:09.919 superb at it uh diagnosis and
00:07:13.240 troubleshooting yeah I can go into any
00:07:14.720 business and work out their issues and
00:07:17.039 do something about it but can they sell
00:07:19.720 that can they can they actually promote
00:07:22.639 that can they create marketing content
00:07:24.560 that demonstrates that to a wide
00:07:26.080 audience so that they never have to
00:07:27.120 worry about sales I'm not so sure if
00:07:29.720 you're a video maker what if you're the
00:07:30.879 greatest video maker on Earth but you
00:07:33.400 never tell
00:07:34.919 anybody and the people who use you who
00:07:37.240 found out about you by referral they
00:07:39.080 don't want to tell anybody else because
00:07:40.599 they want it to be their secret you know
00:07:42.680 they don't want to know how they're
00:07:44.000 doing it how they producing these
00:07:44.919 incredible videos so video maker never
00:07:47.120 does go out there and actually tells the
00:07:48.520 world how wonderful uh their videos
00:07:50.560 actually are so I do Wonder um whether
00:07:54.599 it really is a cash flow problem I think
00:07:56.199 that's more of a indicator or Sy
00:08:00.159 of a wider issue which is I don't know
00:08:02.520 what I'm doing in the first place
00:08:04.960 accountants have the answer to the I
00:08:06.560 don't know what I'm doing
00:08:08.199 question do you do you think this is um
00:08:11.599 just a British thing because we are
00:08:13.520 pretty rubbish at blowing our own
00:08:15.479 trumpets and and saying how good we are
00:08:18.440 I am pleased to say that rubbish is
00:08:20.280 worldwide all right okay um so yeah so
00:08:23.159 yes here in Britain we do have the Great
00:08:24.919 British Reserve I couldn't possibly say
00:08:26.360 how good I was just in case anybody
00:08:27.879 thinks you know that I am so getting
00:08:30.560 above my station uh wonderful song by
00:08:32.760 morisy in 1992 we hate it when our
00:08:34.958 friends become successful um and no the
00:08:39.039 conservative nature of the technical
00:08:40.719 professional I you the accountant is
00:08:42.919 worldwide I've had the the honor of
00:08:46.080 addressing 44 different countries in my
00:08:48.279 career so far and being on five of the
00:08:50.920 Earth's I think seven continents and it
00:08:53.640 is everywhere you go even in Australia
00:08:57.440 where we see an awful lot of the noise
00:08:58.959 coming from about activity and added
00:09:01.399 value you know we hear a lot of noise
00:09:03.200 coming from there but even there the
00:09:04.880 firms there in the provinces in the
00:09:07.560 towns you know in the sort of the the
00:09:10.279 normal sort of streets and high streets
00:09:12.440 and so on same issue okay
00:09:17.560 so if you're really really if you I'm
00:09:21.920 trying to phrase this most small
00:09:25.040 business owners that I work with I speak
00:09:26.680 to MH don't like to say boot to a goose
00:09:29.399 don't like to say that we're really good
00:09:30.560 at
00:09:32.560 something what would you say to these
00:09:35.279 people what should they be saying to to
00:09:38.279 get them out outside of that comfort
00:09:41.160 zone of
00:09:43.640 self-deprecation well here's where we
00:09:46.399 get controversial in our conversation oh
00:09:48.720 I love this carry on okay because I
00:09:50.880 would then met the argument that most of
00:09:52.880 them have no desire to so there's
00:09:55.360 nothing for them to say because the
00:09:57.079 assumption that people actually want to
00:09:59.000 help from an accountant's point of view
00:10:01.160 is is wrong they don't want to
00:10:03.480 help um not all some before you write in
00:10:07.240 viewers not all and from a business
00:10:10.160 owner perspective there is
00:10:11.839 pride there is that pride of you know I
00:10:14.240 don't really want to ask for help I'm
00:10:15.959 I'm going to look stupid if I don't know
00:10:17.600 how to use a simple piece of software
00:10:19.680 that records my profit and loss you know
00:10:22.360 and so they don't reach out so we have
00:10:24.120 an impass okay
00:10:26.839 so I used to say actually in the old
00:10:29.000 days in the the public speaking days I
00:10:31.320 used to say that 18% of the audience no
00:10:35.320 matter whether I was in a room of 20 or
00:10:37.120 a room of you know 4,000 18% were my
00:10:41.160 audience in
00:10:43.079 reality but I didn't know which ones
00:10:45.279 they were yeah y they would identify
00:10:47.880 themselves to me via questions during
00:10:50.480 the session which showed what they were
00:10:51.839 made of via the queue that small queue
00:10:54.560 that you know of 10 people that wait for
00:10:55.959 you after you finish do your keynote
00:10:57.079 while everybody goes out and gets food
00:10:58.920 or the LinkedIn connections that
00:11:00.360 followed thereafter that's how they
00:11:01.880 identified themselves the
00:11:03.639 18% you know so without when you're
00:11:06.800 speaking to a crow you don't know who
00:11:07.959 they are but the reason why it's only
00:11:10.959 18% is because
00:11:14.160 82% um aren't
00:11:16.279 interested they're there for the
00:11:18.639 CPD right or they're waiting for the
00:11:20.959 next talk or oh important email I must
00:11:24.279 deal with it because the world will
00:11:25.240 collapse if I don't you know I must go
00:11:27.480 out of the room at this point um the
00:11:30.000 worst I ever saw 2015 in Paris uh
00:11:32.600 speaker before me was on wasn't
00:11:35.560 incredible but was all right perfectly
00:11:37.560 possible and a guy in the front row very
00:11:39.760 parizzi in this got a copy of lemon
00:11:42.600 newspaper and just
00:11:44.800 went
00:11:48.639 no while the speaker is right there wow
00:11:52.720 and I asked for the person to be removed
00:11:55.160 um saying that's not Cricket I'm afraid
00:11:58.120 um so that unfortunately as
00:12:00.320 controversial as this is that's a large
00:12:02.040 part of the
00:12:03.000 market you know I I had a dinner with a
00:12:05.920 managing partner many years ago when I
00:12:08.000 first started out and I came came up
00:12:10.240 with all these ideas actually I was
00:12:11.360 going we could do this we could do this
00:12:12.560 with the practice oh my goodness we
00:12:13.920 could do that and he just lukewarm to
00:12:16.880 all of
00:12:17.959 them and I said what's going on I'm
00:12:20.639 throwing gold at you here and he says
00:12:22.600 Martin you need to understand that most
00:12:25.440 of us accountants are lazy greedy studs
00:12:31.360 and we just want you to give us your
00:12:33.120 money and go away and I was like what an
00:12:37.519 admission that is okay because it
00:12:41.639 doesn't sound great for me in my
00:12:42.800 marketing if I say 82% of you are lazy
00:12:45.480 GED you
00:12:46.639 know that's not great marketing but do I
00:12:49.880 find it to be the case no I find 82% to
00:12:53.399 just not end up doing anything for some
00:12:55.959 reason always tomorrow yeah can't do it
00:12:59.360 now Partners don't agree don't have the
00:13:02.000 self-esteem to actually go out and help
00:13:03.720 people not really sure how to deliver my
00:13:05.920 Solutions not sure how to prise my
00:13:08.240 Solutions and I'm lazy and greedy all of
00:13:11.600 those things are in the mix so you have
00:13:13.480 to find that 18% and that that's hard
00:13:16.320 work that takes a lot of touring to go
00:13:17.720 and find yeah yeah absolutely um
00:13:22.480 so you've got your 18% MH all right
00:13:26.760 they're Keen to do something yeah do do
00:13:29.720 you not bother with the 82% or do you
00:13:32.079 change your message what what do you do
00:13:34.240 there again fascinating um over the
00:13:38.079 years no I didn't bother I left them to
00:13:40.959 it um my experience is you can't help
00:13:44.760 anybody who doesn't want to help
00:13:45.800 themselves can e their horse to water
00:13:48.480 yeah right now the practice that those
00:13:50.480 those 82% are bet they're profitable
00:13:52.800 firms I bet they're doing just fine I
00:13:54.920 bet they've got plenty of money and
00:13:56.560 they're quite happy doing what it is
00:13:58.000 they do and they have no desire to go
00:14:00.279 above and beyond the Call of Duty
00:14:01.839 there's no judgment there it's simply
00:14:05.000 okay so your my message isn't for you
00:14:06.959 guys yeah see you later you know the 18%
00:14:11.680 and we're talking rough numbers here but
00:14:12.920 the 18% they still have many barriers
00:14:16.560 you know generally around self-esteem if
00:14:18.360 I had to pick the number one I'd pick
00:14:19.920 self-esteem by far and they will always
00:14:23.079 express a self-esteem problem in the
00:14:25.079 following sentence I don't have the
00:14:27.639 time it's like do you got as much time
00:14:30.480 as everybody else has got it's a
00:14:32.480 question of priority and you're not
00:14:33.680 making it a priority because you're
00:14:35.199 scared it's okay to be scared too we can
00:14:37.320 fix that but to to then get 100% then to
00:14:41.759 18% then find the 5% of that 18% that
00:14:45.079 actually go I'm ready I want to I'm
00:14:48.279 prepared to I'll learn I'll face
00:14:50.759 rejection it's all right that is a rare
00:14:54.560 bird but oh my goodness the Legacy they
00:14:58.040 leave behind
00:14:59.959 is
00:15:01.120 extraordinary yeah because they're doing
00:15:03.959 the right thing they're getting job
00:15:05.360 satisfaction they're able to charge a a
00:15:07.279 decent fee they're able to build a build
00:15:10.440 a business that can carry on they are
00:15:14.320 business owners without whomes you know
00:15:16.079 when you know in an award ceremony and
00:15:17.480 somebody get picks up an award and I'd
00:15:18.839 like to thank some and so for this award
00:15:20.680 without whom it wouldn't have been
00:15:22.480 possible I'm not advertising no I'm not
00:15:24.160 advertising that's
00:15:25.720 good just realized I want I picked it up
00:15:28.600 um but they said that without whom I'd
00:15:30.519 like to thank without whom this wouldn't
00:15:32.880 have been possible these types of
00:15:35.160 accountants that we're talking about the
00:15:36.680 five% of the 18% of the
00:15:38.759 100% they are the without whs in
00:15:41.279 business owners
00:15:42.839 lives and the business owners will say
00:15:46.480 to whomever
00:15:48.480 wherever without my accountant I I
00:15:51.279 wouldn't be here I wouldn't even be in
00:15:52.880 business never mind successful never
00:15:54.440 mind picking up this business award
00:15:56.120 never mind opening this new office never
00:15:58.360 mind this new piece of plant Machinery
00:16:00.920 or whatever it's all because of my
00:16:02.680 accountant got involved and I actually
00:16:05.319 cared you know and and that for me that
00:16:09.519 is the high water M that is the ultimate
00:16:11.279 realization of your professional
00:16:12.480 qualifications when you get your ACA or
00:16:15.399 your aat or whatever it is you have you
00:16:17.759 know what's the ultimate of that is it
00:16:20.000 you being in practice maybe is it you
00:16:22.560 having 100 employees maybe is it you
00:16:25.360 being part of a national network maybe
00:16:27.519 but what it really is for me
00:16:29.440 is you've got stories like that coming
00:16:31.079 out of your ears you can tell me about
00:16:34.079 Tony at the brewery you can tell me
00:16:36.279 about Cheryl the construction company
00:16:38.440 you can tell me about all these people
00:16:40.639 who were struggling until you came in
00:16:43.480 and got
00:16:44.399 involved and then you turned it around
00:16:46.639 and they're off now towards their
00:16:47.839 professional personal aspirations
00:16:49.079 whatever it is they're pursuing all
00:16:50.839 thanks to you that proactive accountant
00:16:53.600 yeah and and and let you say proactive
00:16:56.839 accountant and and you know when you
00:16:58.519 meet the you
00:16:59.759 know but what you're saying is 82% are
00:17:03.199 quite happy with the status quo yeah
00:17:05.439 again I'm going to get killed on these
00:17:06.640 numbers says 82% and we could disprove
00:17:09.319 this and this is my personal experience
00:17:11.799 from a 10 year speaking career on
00:17:14.319 average yeah and and that is if you
00:17:16.439 don't like myate just that's if you
00:17:18.439 don't like myate abolutely you know what
00:17:20.199 that's a good point let's go there let's
00:17:21.439 go there that's a great point it is also
00:17:25.000 to screw the numbers it's also very very
00:17:28.039 valid to say
00:17:29.640 that you could have two
00:17:31.000 speakers get up and give the exact same
00:17:33.720 message they don't listen to a thing I
00:17:35.760 say but the other person hits home no
00:17:37.840 problem at all yeah because the way I
00:17:39.840 said it they didn't like the way the
00:17:40.919 other person said it they did like you
00:17:42.840 know so if we put that speaker's numbers
00:17:44.960 with my numbers all of a sudden we might
00:17:46.200 have a bigger portion of the room now
00:17:48.400 you know all of a sudden but
00:17:50.080 nevertheless um it's still the minority
00:17:52.640 rather than the majority and again there
00:17:54.600 isn't a judgment there it's simply
00:17:56.799 statement of fact
00:17:59.440 let's let's let's let's talk about this
00:18:00.440 Marmite thing because this is brilliant
00:18:01.960 because a lot a lot of accountants don't
00:18:04.159 want to be Marmite they want to be all
00:18:05.960 things to everybody and I think I think
00:18:08.280 what we need to do is embrace our inner
00:18:10.400 Marmite isn't it it really depends if
00:18:12.960 you want to make any money or not um for
00:18:16.039 for me I can't help it I'm the ultimate
00:18:19.520 one trick pory I can only do very direct
00:18:22.080 speaking and over the years I started
00:18:25.240 off being the the rebel who just didn't
00:18:27.799 care you know when she was actually reel
00:18:30.520 without a clue and lacked tact lacked
00:18:34.880 diplomacy lacked experience and so I
00:18:37.840 thought I was being so um you know so
00:18:40.880 disruptive with my cutting through the
00:18:43.679 crap getting to the point things all I
00:18:46.000 was doing was winding people up you know
00:18:48.679 not really helping anybody at all over
00:18:50.960 the years what I've tried to do and only
00:18:52.760 the audience can tell you as to whether
00:18:53.840 I've been successful or not is to
00:18:56.000 deliver it in a very very soft tone that
00:18:57.760 shows them that I care
00:19:00.080 and not deliver it as a
00:19:02.760 accusation but as a observation what
00:19:06.400 we're going to do guys you know guys am
00:19:09.440 I wrong here do you ever do the things
00:19:11.640 I'm saying you you don't do prove me
00:19:14.039 wrong nobody can well there we are you
00:19:17.720 know and and that tone appeared to cure
00:19:22.840 the Marite problem a wee bit more
00:19:25.200 because I would still say direct
00:19:26.960 things but in a let's go with loving way
00:19:31.679 certainly a caring way and the audience
00:19:34.159 go don't like what he's saying but I do
00:19:36.080 like the way he's saying it and it was
00:19:38.240 interesting whenever I get asked back
00:19:39.919 and there was some places where they
00:19:41.039 asked me back an awful lot so I thought
00:19:42.559 are there know other
00:19:44.520 speakers but the picking is this slim
00:19:47.679 that I'm back from the ninth year what's
00:19:48.840 going on you know um I would say why am
00:19:51.840 I back and they couldn't tell me because
00:19:55.640 they would say first of all nobody knew
00:19:57.159 what my name was okay so that get that
00:19:59.919 Malcolm Bishop back he was good that
00:20:01.919 Malcolm Bishop we liked him you been
00:20:04.360 Martin biss whatever yeah so didn't know
00:20:07.200 my name couldn't tell me much about my
00:20:08.840 content couldn't tell me whether my
00:20:10.520 slides worked or my audio worked or my
00:20:12.240 slides or not couldn't really tell me
00:20:13.760 much about any of those and certainly
00:20:14.720 hadn't implemented anything that I'd
00:20:16.640 asked them to do but when when you said
00:20:19.240 so why am I
00:20:20.720 back the phrase is always the same we
00:20:23.720 like how we feel when you're here yeah
00:20:26.600 which you can bring down to one word
00:20:27.919 energy yeah y so it would appear and I'm
00:20:30.960 certainly not alone in this there are
00:20:31.880 many other speakers that qualify for
00:20:33.080 this one as well in Professional
00:20:34.640 Services that for some reason the energy
00:20:38.640 which I take to me the fact that it was
00:20:40.480 clear that I cared about them very much
00:20:43.080 so that was coming across
00:20:45.600 now and they were prepared to tolerate
00:20:48.000 my
00:20:48.840 directness which might make them feel
00:20:50.559 uncomfortable because I did it in a
00:20:52.280 caring way and it's like we actually
00:20:54.480 like this we like having a little bit of
00:20:56.520 a kick up the backside because it's not
00:20:57.919 being done nly it's not been done
00:21:01.760 judgmentally and therefore we'll handle
00:21:03.880 your controversy because you
00:21:06.159 care we'll take that and that seemed to
00:21:09.280 be the tradeoff um in the latter years
00:21:11.360 of speaking no like that and and and
00:21:14.000 that's the thing is um people don't
00:21:17.919 remember what you did but they do
00:21:19.400 remember how you made them feel and you
00:21:22.559 you know you actually you're doing that
00:21:24.840 um Okay so we've
00:21:26.320 got um Young
00:21:29.520 practices starting up um you taking
00:21:32.960 advantage of all the tech um AI um maybe
00:21:38.000 offshoring and stuff like that and they
00:21:39.919 can do things leaner quicker and stuff
00:21:42.240 like that yeah these These are going to
00:21:45.039 be the
00:21:46.360 18% surely the 82% should be thinking
00:21:49.640 hang on a minute why aren't we doing any
00:21:51.200 of that it it's interesting but money is
00:21:53.960 a great
00:21:55.039 anesthetic you know if if you're making
00:21:57.640 money who
00:21:59.520 cares they're not really that bothered
00:22:01.600 as to whether they're being super
00:22:02.640 Proactive or super reactive the money's
00:22:04.360 coming in why make the extra effort but
00:22:07.120 but didn't didn't Blockbuster make a lot
00:22:09.559 of money yeah they did I think the
00:22:11.760 shareholders who got out in time are
00:22:13.080 very happy with what happened yeah
00:22:15.080 because probably shareholders of Netflix
00:22:16.360 now but um but what I think is you know
00:22:19.600 what I used to I would dress like the
00:22:21.960 audience you see how I'm dressed today
00:22:24.039 you know I would dress like the audience
00:22:25.480 dressed you know the audience dressed
00:22:27.520 like you these days actually not me they
00:22:29.320 they do they dress like you and and that
00:22:31.640 and K was kind of like the defining
00:22:32.919 point there when we came back through
00:22:34.640 accountex style events uh other events
00:22:38.080 are available when we came to back to
00:22:41.080 that after covid all of a sudden hoodies
00:22:44.480 beards laptop stickers you know started
00:22:47.320 to make up the audience and it was the
00:22:48.400 first time when I didn't recognize the
00:22:49.600 audience anymore usually I go out look
00:22:52.320 at her room and go I I know a good 20 to
00:22:54.360 30 of you straight away and I can play
00:22:56.039 to you now because I know I know that
00:22:57.679 you know me it was a new audience it was
00:22:59.840 a far more diverse
00:23:01.480 audience it was a far more I would say
00:23:05.200 representative audience and that's
00:23:07.919 exciting because that's new
00:23:09.559 opportunities and we can Shuffle old
00:23:12.240 farts like me off the stage and get new
00:23:14.080 voices in as well to speak to them um
00:23:17.279 but do we automatically assume that they
00:23:19.240 are uh suddenly free from the problems
00:23:22.080 of running a practice and have no hiring
00:23:24.520 issues and have no pricing issues and
00:23:26.159 have no self-esteem issues no same
00:23:28.159 issues
00:23:29.600 same issues again just in a different
00:23:31.400 set of clothes this
00:23:32.760 time because young people setting up
00:23:35.799 practices are still
00:23:37.880 inexperienced they still question
00:23:39.799 themselves they still don't have 10 20
00:23:42.640 grand clients that they can price anchor
00:23:44.480 and go this is what I do for them and
00:23:46.080 that's how much it costs you know so
00:23:48.880 getting past those typical break points
00:23:50.880 in accounting 1500 quid 2500 quid and so
00:23:53.559 on still difficult so to automatically
00:23:56.640 assume that they're the 18% I wouldn't
00:23:58.840 automatically assume that I would assume
00:24:01.200 that we're still looking for the
00:24:03.039 characters the
00:24:04.880 individuals the the the ones who have
00:24:07.240 made a decision in their heart I'm going
00:24:09.919 out to help
00:24:11.400 people rather than I'm building an
00:24:13.720 accounting
00:24:14.919 practice you know they just coming all
00:24:17.720 different shap and sizes
00:24:19.360 now I think I think that's the thing you
00:24:21.279 just you just said it accounting
00:24:23.200 practice the the 18% are running a
00:24:26.080 business oh right they're running a
00:24:29.000 business that just happens to do
00:24:30.520 accounts and we wondering we're
00:24:32.520 wondering through the world of the baker
00:24:33.440 model now at this point Professional
00:24:34.919 Services firm versus Professional
00:24:36.240 Knowledge firm um my good friend will
00:24:38.559 farell would tell you that there are
00:24:41.120 accounting practices and there are
00:24:43.120 accounting businesses and he would
00:24:44.960 Define the difference for you as per the
00:24:46.600 baker model the Ron Baker model from
00:24:47.960 from of the future book in 2003 um so
00:24:52.840 are they running businesses that just
00:24:54.320 happen to provide accounting yeah yeah
00:24:56.760 I'll go with that but they still trained
00:25:00.159 as an accountant they haven't come from
00:25:01.919 sales they haven't come from marketing
00:25:04.600 they haven't come from Global corporate
00:25:06.760 branding to run an accounting
00:25:09.120 practice they are qualified by some
00:25:13.360 governing body somewhere and therefore
00:25:16.360 still have those parameters those mental
00:25:19.559 parameters and operational parameters
00:25:22.360 that are taught in the accounting
00:25:25.520 curriculum no perfect I got a question
00:25:27.919 here for to you from Pavo um just say
00:25:30.360 hello to Linda um Pavo is saying would
00:25:33.039 you recommend to dress down to match the
00:25:34.720 audience despite despite personal
00:25:36.480 preference for business casual I love
00:25:38.480 that pav I would recommend you do you
00:25:41.640 yeah and don't worry about the audience
00:25:43.760 um because if you want to relate to them
00:25:45.760 what you're wearing will not make much
00:25:46.799 of a difference um they'll relate to the
00:25:49.760 tone of your voice your body language
00:25:51.440 your knowledge your experience your
00:25:53.039 stories and whether you do that in a
00:25:55.760 suit whether you do that in a T-shirt
00:25:57.320 and jeans whether you do that in a
00:25:58.399 chicken costume doesn't really matter
00:26:00.279 too much you probably get remembered for
00:26:01.399 the chicken costume to be fair but it's
00:26:03.440 not going to make an enormous difference
00:26:05.320 it's you that's going to make the
00:26:06.720 enormous difference so this is actually
00:26:09.440 a 90s thing might even be older than
00:26:11.159 that called profile matching where if
00:26:13.799 you had an appointment with a new client
00:26:15.600 who was a 55y old male boat Enthusiast
00:26:18.320 you'd send your 55y old male boat
00:26:19.840 Enthusiast to go and meet with them so
00:26:22.000 that there was Common Ground there the
00:26:25.919 problem with that idea is that your 55
00:26:29.720 male Bol enthusiasts might have all the
00:26:31.520 Char Charisma of a corpse yeah and
00:26:34.200 therefore be no Ed to doing a new
00:26:35.240 business scenario whatsoever but had you
00:26:37.159 sent the managing partner out would have
00:26:39.200 been great so I'm not a fan of these
00:26:42.559 sorts of ideas just be you and you will
00:26:45.640 attract your tribe no matter what I I
00:26:47.960 was invited to a a networking event by a
00:26:50.440 firm of solicitors and I oh should I put
00:26:54.520 should I no no they inv they've invited
00:26:57.880 me they've invited me I am going to wear
00:27:00.559 my yellow t-shirt my Converse and my
00:27:02.960 jeans and and and Martin you turn up in
00:27:05.279 a you know in a jacket you look smart
00:27:06.799 you've got your handkerchief um is that
00:27:09.200 on brand today Martin we we we try we
00:27:12.320 try to at least concede a little bit I
00:27:15.200 love it I love it so those of you are
00:27:17.320 listening on the podcast Martin is sat
00:27:18.919 here in a lovely jacket and sticking out
00:27:21.000 of his pocket is a yellow kief so that
00:27:23.960 is awesome I know really good
00:27:26.799 um so
00:27:30.159 you just said that they're running a
00:27:32.880 business but they're not marketers they
00:27:34.480 haven't come from sales is that where
00:27:36.760 the magic starts
00:27:38.880 happening Define magic what magic are we
00:27:41.159 looking for
00:27:42.360 here um being a successful business with
00:27:47.000 streams of customers you know knocking
00:27:49.519 at the door interesting one success is a
00:27:52.840 one player game obviously so it depends
00:27:54.440 how that individual defines success they
00:27:56.320 might think that being a 60,000 practice
00:28:00.559 and working three days a week is the
00:28:02.039 ultimate definition of success and if
00:28:03.480 they do then that's exactly what they
00:28:04.679 should go for um I have had the
00:28:07.120 opportunity in the bookkeepers community
00:28:09.320 to meet with an awful lot of working
00:28:10.919 moms who stress about balancing what
00:28:13.919 they have their their professional uh
00:28:16.440 commitments with their home commitments
00:28:19.440 and and that's a that's an ongoing
00:28:20.960 challenge for them but they worry about
00:28:23.080 it as if it mattered by which I mean by
00:28:28.440 which I mean do the thing you love and
00:28:30.519 if that's home do that you know and and
00:28:33.240 so long as you can meet the morgage
00:28:34.320 payment it's going to be okay don't
00:28:35.240 worry but they they Bo about trying to
00:28:37.360 be all things to all people and it's
00:28:39.840 very few that actually ever get to that
00:28:42.519 uh it's a strange ideal to hold yourself
00:28:44.399 to but in terms of the
00:28:45.799 Magic The Magic happens in my view
00:28:49.080 actually in Professional Services so we
00:28:50.960 could be talking about accounting or
00:28:51.880 book keeping here when you tell your
00:28:55.200 stories to your potential audience by
00:28:58.440 which I mean if you were the person who
00:29:02.000 dug the business owner out of the
00:29:03.960 bankruptcy
00:29:05.600 scenario if you were the person who tied
00:29:08.519 up three years worth of historic
00:29:11.880 accounts and let them sleep at night the
00:29:14.200 business own to sleep at night as a
00:29:15.640 result if you were the person who made
00:29:19.240 sure that the V investigation went well
00:29:22.080 if you were the person that helped me
00:29:23.159 secure extra funding if you one of those
00:29:26.120 people those stories need to be out of
00:29:29.120 your head and into the public domain
00:29:32.039 because everybody's got them and and
00:29:34.360 like I said speaking is not a huge part
00:29:35.880 of what I do anymore but when it was I
00:29:38.360 would ask the audience who can tell me
00:29:40.880 about the greatest thing they ever
00:29:42.120 achieved for their clients and of course
00:29:44.399 nobody wants to go first everybody's
00:29:46.159 like not me to create the impression
00:29:49.000 that nobody's done anything in that room
00:29:51.480 well I knew better so as soon as you
00:29:53.480 start picking on
00:29:55.320 someone they find the story and it'll be
00:29:57.519 an amazing story as well by the way
00:30:00.600 they'll have saved somebody I don't know
00:30:02.799 1.8 million in corporation tax and those
00:30:05.679 funds were reinvested in the business or
00:30:07.399 something you know they'll tell you
00:30:08.679 about that but they wouldn't have said a
00:30:11.159 word had I not have picked on them only
00:30:14.000 shared that story under
00:30:15.960 duress from the gobby speaker who wants
00:30:19.200 them to you know and it's like such
00:30:22.519 reticence is self-defeating
00:30:25.200 you know if you if if the if practices
00:30:28.960 would just say yeah we helped that and
00:30:31.000 you don't even have to name who they are
00:30:32.279 we helped the business in that area that
00:30:34.399 does that sort of thing we help them
00:30:36.440 with this we help them with that because
00:30:38.480 it's what we
00:30:39.559 do I would love to see that happen
00:30:41.760 because business owners would become far
00:30:42.919 more educated instead what accountant
00:30:44.279 can really do and don't dispute the bill
00:30:46.559 every 10 seconds you know accountants
00:30:49.080 would feel less inclined to have to
00:30:50.399 climb down on bills and do write offs
00:30:53.440 and write Downs because they haven't got
00:30:55.960 the selfon Ence to actually stand up for
00:30:59.480 themselves in a in a fee negotiation
00:31:01.080 scenario those things would change those
00:31:03.000 Dynamics would change and I know full
00:31:05.080 well that our audience listening now or
00:31:06.720 later is going to have those stories and
00:31:09.200 if we allow them to they'd tell us and
00:31:11.159 we'd be wowed by them it's happened in
00:31:13.799 every country I've spoken in it's
00:31:15.399 happened in every audience no matter
00:31:16.639 what size of firm we're discussing
00:31:18.760 everyone has helped someone in an
00:31:21.200 incredible way and they don't bother
00:31:23.600 ever telling you about it it can't be
00:31:25.360 found on the website and it ain't in the
00:31:26.919 marketing material so it's a long way of
00:31:28.960 saying yeah if we get past that bit and
00:31:31.320 we start to tell our stories that's when
00:31:33.039 the magic happens yes brilliant that's
00:31:36.279 not even marketing it's just repeating a
00:31:38.399 story isn't it just tell stories yeah
00:31:40.960 abely maybe you call it Network get
00:31:43.159 don't know depending on how you tell
00:31:44.320 your story but it's just having the it's
00:31:47.919 having
00:31:49.159 the wherewithal the ability to look
00:31:52.600 yourself in the mirror and go I'm good
00:31:54.200 at what I do yeah that's not a boast
00:31:56.600 that's not a humble brag it's statement
00:31:58.240 of fact here's my proof yeah I mean
00:32:00.919 myself actually if I may tip my camera a
00:32:02.799 second there we go the careers yeah look
00:32:06.399 at that the career is up there in the
00:32:08.360 wall I shallan take you through it but
00:32:09.880 basically the highlights from the career
00:32:11.840 are up there yeah whatever they happen
00:32:14.159 to be and they're there because one it
00:32:17.559 looks nice when we film in front of it
00:32:18.880 but also when I come in in the morning
00:32:20.960 if I ain't having a great morning or I
00:32:22.240 didn't have a great day yesterday or I'm
00:32:23.480 not having a great month that's the
00:32:25.039 reminder that I've actually done stuff
00:32:27.159 yeah I love that remind me they actually
00:32:28.639 done stuff so that is the confirmation
00:32:30.559 to me saying yeah you're actually half
00:32:32.639 decent in what you do carry on and I
00:32:34.760 would love every accountant and
00:32:36.360 bookkeeper to have a pictoral
00:32:38.279 representation of their career to go I

00:33:34.159 organization great organization Martin
00:33:36.399 quick question for you then so um this I
00:33:38.720 I ask this question with everybody when
00:33:41.519 you were at school okay in primary
00:33:43.600 school so running around with your
00:33:44.880 shorts on what did you want to be when
00:33:47.200 you grew up what made you think I was
00:33:49.000 wearing shorts uh yeah I'm got a very
00:33:51.360 boring answer I'm afraid if I'm telling
00:33:52.919 the truth it was a footballer good uh
00:33:55.799 then it evolved into a photographer
00:33:58.360 oh wow cool and then it evolved into an
00:34:00.960 author so I got there on the third
00:34:02.240 attempt fantastic so you actually were
00:34:04.519 at school thinking you wanted to be an
00:34:06.240 author eventually yeah I mean that was
00:34:08.280 Secondary School by by the time I got
00:34:09.560 that but yeah but yeah primary school
00:34:11.679 was
00:34:12.320 footballer um and there's a whole story
00:34:15.040 as to why that didn't happen um but then
00:34:17.320 photographer I was very interested in
00:34:18.960 photography and um I used to do
00:34:21.800 freelance work for the local paper um
00:34:24.199 but I couldn't see a career I couldn't
00:34:25.800 see it this is the pre- internet age
00:34:27.159 that we're discussing
00:34:28.480 couldn't see couldn't see how you would
00:34:30.000 monetize it um I seem to have an ability
00:34:33.040 to communicate in words so I thought
00:34:35.079 okay let's try writing and you know the
00:34:38.560 the exams went well in English um 17
