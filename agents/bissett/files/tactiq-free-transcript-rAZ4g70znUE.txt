00:00:03.950 hi so I'm Martin Behcet's I'm the
00:00:06.180 founder of the upward spiral partnership
00:00:07.890 and these days known as a knowledge
00:00:09.450 partner - managing partners CEOs and
00:00:13.019 sole practitioners of accounting firms
00:00:14.790 institutes and networks globally I came
00:00:21.449 into the accounting profession by
00:00:22.529 complete fluke by absolute chance
00:00:25.380 21 years ago here in Woking when there
00:00:29.519 was a major sea change happening in the
00:00:31.019 profession and that 21 years he served
00:00:34.110 me very well and it's where I draw my
00:00:36.210 experience and data for the workshop and
00:00:40.980 keynote that I'll be doing in accounting
00:00:42.360 life although there's two big mistakes
00:00:47.550 one mistake is made by us the expert
00:00:51.870 community and that we think in the
00:00:53.460 accounting profession is broken when
00:00:54.570 it's not but for practices those who
00:00:57.960 believe they can rely on compliance
00:01:00.120 indefinitely are already experiencing a
00:01:03.539 shock to the system and the business
00:01:05.250 model which has served the profession
00:01:06.840 since the 1890s is having to be tweaked
00:01:09.840 in 2018 the first step for any practice
00:01:16.560 wishing to move from compliance to
00:01:17.909 reliance is to understand what the
00:01:20.100 client needs from you in order to them
00:01:22.680 to achieve their ultimate and business
00:01:24.450 aspirations and that's where we start
00:01:26.640 the move away from the recording the
00:01:29.880 scorekeeping through to the storytelling
00:01:35.310 the cash compass is four simple points
00:01:37.899 to point you in the right direction to
00:01:39.759 ensure the future profitability of your
00:01:41.380 firm many people make money from making
00:01:44.320 the simple into something complex I like
00:01:46.990 to make the complex into something
00:01:48.070 simple and so we're going to give you
00:01:49.810 four pointers immediately implementable
00:01:52.509 pointers to take your practice to profit
00:01:55.179 or even greater profits in 2090
00:02:00.600 accounting professionals need to come to
00:02:03.009 account in life to be aware of the sea
00:02:05.229 changes that are going on in the
00:02:07.060 profession it is generally now the case
00:02:09.250 that the vendors the tech companies
00:02:11.860 control the narrative of how this
00:02:14.230 profession is progressing which is
00:02:15.670 change from how it was ten years ago and
00:02:17.380 so it's critical for practitioners to
00:02:20.080 understand and be on the cutting edge of
00:02:21.880 innovation and increased effectiveness
00:02:24.970 so that they can serve the clients to
00:02:26.680 the best of their ability and not get
00:02:28.390 left behind
