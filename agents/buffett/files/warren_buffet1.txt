00:00:00.040 towards the end of 2018 you mentioned
00:00:03.360 that you guarantee you could make a 50%
00:00:06.560 annual return if you had to start again
00:00:09.320 with under $1 million the question is if
00:00:12.960 tomorrow you woke up in the body of a of
00:00:16.960 of P bodyy old P body but that's
00:00:23.519 fine and your name was now Warren
00:00:27.519 alakat and you had some money to Inver
00:00:30.359 on a full-time basis what method or
00:00:32.920 methods would you use to achieve that
00:00:35.680 return would it involve flipping through
00:00:38.200 20,000 pages of Moody's manual or
00:00:41.280 similar Publications or finding you you
00:00:44.280 know to find buts or would it be hunting
00:00:47.320 for great companies at a fair price as
00:00:49.760 Mr MW or would it be a combination of
00:00:52.760 both with opportunity cost serving as
00:00:55.199 the final Arbiter of which method to use
00:00:57.719 given that your investing opportunity
00:00:59.559 has now broaden significantly thank you
00:01:02.199 cop good question I'm glad you came and
00:01:05.000 the uh the answer would be in my
00:01:09.479 particular case it would be going
00:01:12.040 through the 20,000 pages and since we
00:01:15.759 were talking about railroads you know I
00:01:18.360 went through the Moody Transportation
00:01:20.000 manual a couple of times that was 1500
00:01:22.400 or 2,000 Pages or well probably 1500
00:01:25.079 pages and I found all kinds of
00:01:27.759 interesting things when I was 50 or when
00:01:29.920 when I
00:01:30.720 was uh 20 or 21 and I don't imagine
00:01:36.720 there's anybody here that knows about
00:01:38.960 the Green Bay and Western railroad
00:01:41.360 company but uh there were hundreds and
00:01:43.600 hundreds of railroad companies and I
00:01:45.200 like to read about every one of them the
00:01:47.560 green band
00:01:48.719 Western uh in those days everybody had a
00:01:51.920 nickname for for railroads I mean that
00:01:54.560 was that was just what Northern Pacific
00:01:57.039 was the Nipper and you know TB snow
00:02:02.320 was one of them in the East that used to
00:02:04.560 go up to Cornell and uh the green band
00:02:07.960 Western was known as grab baggage and
00:02:11.680 walk and
00:02:13.760 gbnw and they had an they had a bond
00:02:18.200 that was actually the common stock and
00:02:20.040 they had a common stock that was
00:02:21.440 actually a bond and you know that that
00:02:26.040 could lead to unusual things but they
00:02:29.120 wouldn't lead unusual things that would
00:02:31.000 work for you with many millions of
00:02:33.000 dollars but but if you collected a whole
00:02:36.640 bunch of
00:02:37.680 those which I set out to do and actually
00:02:41.280 that's what impressed Charlie when I
00:02:42.760 first met him because I knew all the
00:02:44.599 details of all these little companies on
00:02:46.959 the west coast that he thought I would
00:02:48.440 never have heard of but but I knew about
00:02:50.480 the Los Angeles Athletic Club or
00:02:52.560 whatever it might be and he thought he
00:02:56.080 was the only one that knew about that
00:02:57.720 and that that that uh
00:03:00.760 that became an instant point of
00:03:03.440 connection so to answer your question uh
00:03:07.879 I would I would I don't know what the
00:03:10.159 equivalent of Moody's manuals or
00:03:11.680 anything would be now but I would I
00:03:14.080 would try and know everything about
00:03:16.000 everything small and I would find
00:03:19.760 something and with a million dollars you
00:03:23.319 could earn 50% a year but you have to be
00:03:25.680 in love with the
00:03:27.120 subject uh you can't just be in love
00:03:29.920 with the money you really got to just
00:03:31.640 find it like a you know essentially like
00:03:35.400 you know people find other things in
00:03:37.280 other fields cuz they just love looking
00:03:39.720 for it a biologist looks for something
00:03:42.319 because they they they want to find
00:03:45.360 something they and it's built in I don't
00:03:48.680 know how the human brain works that much
00:03:50.319 and I don't think anybody understands
00:03:51.959 too well how the human brain works but
00:03:54.439 but there's different people that that
00:03:57.239 uh just find it exciting
00:04:00.480 to expand their knowledge in a given
00:04:02.480 area we
00:04:05.040 uh you know I know Great British players
00:04:07.879 I know great chess players actually uh
00:04:11.560 Kasparov came to Al met Mrs B I've had
00:04:15.560 the luck of of meeting a lot of people
00:04:18.759 that are unbelievably Smart in their own
00:04:23.120 Arena and do some unbelievably dumb
00:04:26.440 things in other areas so all I know is
00:04:30.120 the human brain is complicated and but
00:04:33.880 it does its best when you find out what
00:04:37.199 your brain is really suited for and then
00:04:39.120 you just uh pound the hell out from that
00:04:42.120 point and that's what I would be doing
00:04:44.479 if I if I had a small amount of money
00:04:47.639 and I wanted to make 50% a year but I
00:04:50.479 also wanted to just play the game and
00:04:53.600 you can't do it if you really if you
00:04:55.639 don't find the the game of Interest
00:04:58.080 whether it's Bridge or whether you know
00:04:59.840 whatever it may be chess or this case
00:05:03.919 finding Securities that are undervalued
00:05:06.240 but it sounds to me like you're on the
00:05:07.560 right track I mean anybody that will
00:05:09.000 come all the way to this annual meeting
00:05:12.000 has got something in their mind other
00:05:13.960 than Bridge or chess uh so I'm glad you
00:05:17.639 came and come again next year
