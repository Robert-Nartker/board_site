00:01:06.159 Murphy
00:01:07.280 Jr Ron Olen Wally whites and Merl
00:01:12.400 Whitmer
00:01:22.840 okay uh there are two people I would
00:01:26.159 like to thank and then we'll get on to
00:01:28.320 the uh brief description of the results
00:01:31.600 of the uh first
00:01:34.280 quarter uh first of all
00:01:37.640 I'd like to thank Melissa Shapiro who
00:01:41.840 put this whole event together that you
00:01:43.880 can't imagine the work that goes into it
00:01:52.439 but she just reported to me that we set
00:01:55.360 a new record for seiz candy I think they
00:01:59.479 brought on six tons and they will sell
00:02:03.079 out uh and one thing I do want to
00:02:05.840 mention we have only one book as a
00:02:08.878 bookstore The Bookworm this this uh year
00:02:12.800 normally we have about 25 but we have p
00:02:15.879 po poor Charlie Almanac fourth edition
00:02:19.599 and I think we sold about 2400 of them
00:02:22.879 yesterday and uh uh that will be the
00:02:26.360 only book next next year we'll go back
00:02:28.599 to having our usual selection uh but we
00:02:32.760 thought we would uh just turn it over to
00:02:34.800 Charlie this year and then uh I would
00:02:38.959 like to introduce one further person and
00:02:42.680 that's uh the person who put that movie
00:02:46.720 together and you can't imagine the
00:02:49.159 amount of work it is because for example
00:02:52.159 on those scenes that we've used from the
00:02:55.120 past uh if they
00:02:58.440 involved uh Hollywood stars or burgus
00:03:02.680 people we needed to get permission all
00:03:05.400 over again to show it because we're we
00:03:08.239 told them originally we would only show
00:03:10.280 it uh within the confines of our uh
00:03:15.599 Auditorium here and uh of course it went
00:03:19.200 out on CNBC and and you just can't
00:03:21.959 imagine how much effort but also the the
00:03:26.280 the great cooperation we got from uh
00:03:30.519 all those Desperate Housewives and jam
00:03:33.799 Lee and with the Desperate Housewives we
00:03:37.280 we had to get Disney's okay and and that
00:03:40.159 was easy to get but running down five
00:03:42.480 Desperate
00:03:44.959 Housewives that one came on came in
00:03:47.239 toward the end but we that that the job
00:03:50.840 of putting this together has been
00:03:53.120 handled by the same fellow that handles
00:03:55.599 us been doing these for years and years
00:03:59.920 and years and years and I just would
00:04:02.560 appreciate it if you could just put the
00:04:04.879 spotlight on Brad Underwood for just a
00:04:19.959 minute okay we um we put out some
00:04:24.600 results uh for the first quarter this
00:04:27.680 morning at 7:00 our time and uh uh some
00:04:33.400 uh few sharpy analysts and and uh press
00:04:38.479 people already picked up one or two
00:04:40.440 items from it which I'm sure we'll get
00:04:43.080 some questions on later but if we can
00:04:45.880 start out with slide number one which is
00:04:48.840 should be showing now you'll see that
00:04:52.560 that in the first
00:04:54.320 quarter the way and we talk about
00:04:57.120 operating earnings at Berkshire we we
00:04:59.759 explained that many times is why we
00:05:02.199 think these figures that we give you are
00:05:04.440 the most descriptive of what's really
00:05:06.080 going on in the business and and take
00:05:09.479 out the wild swings in the market that
00:05:12.759 uh that otherwise just uh you know and
00:05:16.400 that was reporting big earnings one
00:05:18.240 quarter and big losses another quarter
00:05:20.520 we we pay no attention to those at
00:05:22.639 Berkshire but you will see that that we
00:05:27.319 had uh a better than average quarter uh
00:05:33.800 and a g
00:05:35.840 Jane wants me to point out to everyone
00:05:39.479 that you cannot take the insurance
00:05:41.919 earnings of the first quarter and
00:05:43.360 multiply by four uh it it it just
00:05:47.240 doesn't work that way in insurance and
00:05:50.520 uh while we insure storms around the
00:05:54.319 world the major storms for example that
00:05:57.840 would affect our earnings would be
00:06:00.960 probably number one would be some
00:06:02.880 something uh that went along the that
00:06:06.520 came in at the wrong place from our
00:06:08.400 standpoint and then just kept going up
00:06:10.840 the east coast and that's
00:06:14.400 our that's our number one risk as we
00:06:18.240 evaluate things but we're in all kinds
00:06:20.039 of risks there can be an earthquake
00:06:22.440 tomorrow there can be an earthquake 10
00:06:24.360 years from now and then they're you know
00:06:26.639 we we're in that sort of business but
00:06:28.280 the first quarter does
00:06:30.680 does um hit the uh should be our best
00:06:36.919 quarter certainly shouldn't be our worst
00:06:38.720 quarter the most likely quarter to be
00:06:40.840 the worst quarters the third quarter but
00:06:43.319 anything can happen insurance but
00:06:45.919 fortunately nothing much happened in
00:06:47.560 Insurance during the first quarter so we
00:06:50.120 had much improved earnings in in
00:06:53.599 Insurance underwriting and then our
00:06:55.560 investment income was was almost bound
00:06:57.639 to well it was almost certain to
00:06:59.199 increase and I said that in the annual
00:07:01.599 report because yields are so much higher
00:07:05.319 than they were uh last year and we have
00:07:11.000 uh a lot of fixed short short-term
00:07:13.919 Investments that are very responsive to
00:07:16.639 the changes in interest rates so that
00:07:19.440 figure is up substantially and I can
00:07:21.879 predict that that one will be up uh for
00:07:25.960 the year uh uh we've got
00:07:30.639 more money to invest as we'll get to in
00:07:33.199 a minute and uh that's fairly
00:07:36.160 predictable uh so that number will be up
00:07:39.160 when you get into the into the railroad
00:07:43.840 the railroad
00:07:45.000 earnings uh we down modestly and and uh
00:07:50.159 but
00:07:52.080 uh
00:07:54.000 we should not immediately but we we we
00:07:57.960 should be earning somewhat more money
00:08:00.680 than we are earning under present
00:08:03.400 traffic conditions and then traffic
00:08:05.360 conditions can also hit the uh earning
00:08:09.280 uh it's a potential earnings of the
00:08:11.479 railroad and uh if you want every
00:08:16.080 Wednesday uh you can get car loadings
00:08:20.319 from the previous week and I'll reg go a
00:08:23.840 little deranged if you do get them but I
00:08:26.039 get them every week uh they're available
00:08:28.599 and you'll see that loadings have been
00:08:30.680 running uh for the industry have been
00:08:33.559 running down modestly and uh
00:08:38.640 uh these earnings
00:08:41.559 are were as is expected but but we
00:08:45.480 should earn somewhat more money than
00:08:48.279 that on the equivalent amount of car
00:08:50.080 loadings and uh uh uh we in the Energy
00:08:56.600 company uh we had
00:09:00.320 better earnings but our earnings were
00:09:02.320 distorted well they they were affected
00:09:04.839 by conditions that I wrote about in the
00:09:07.760 annual report and we'll undoubtedly
00:09:09.839 discuss more this morning but uh a uh
00:09:14.079 off a low base of last year they were up
00:09:17.120 somewhat and uh so you get uh down to
00:09:21.480 the final figure and uh 11.2
00:09:26.240 billion
00:09:27.800 is uh
00:09:30.320 it's quite an improvement from last year
00:09:33.120 but we would expect our earnings should
00:09:37.240 go up modestly from year to year because
00:09:40.399 after all we we're retaining like 37
00:09:43.519 billion last year of earnings so if we
00:09:46.079 put 37 billion more you left it with us
00:09:50.560 uh we should do something that's
00:09:52.079 satisfactory and the goal of Berkshire
00:09:54.440 economic goal is to increase the
00:09:58.000 operating earnings and increase the
00:09:59.760 shares outstanding it's that simple to
00:10:03.200 describe it's not quite so simple to
00:10:05.320 pull off necessarily but that that
00:10:07.959 that's what we're attempting to do and
00:10:10.440 if we'll turn to slide two
00:10:13.720 please I've got the history and I I just
00:10:17.600 picked the pre
00:10:19.600 pandemic uh uh year of when we hit 24
00:10:25.480 billion and then we fell off in the
00:10:28.720 first
00:10:30.279 year of the pandemic and then as you see
00:10:32.680 we've moved up from 27 to 30 to 37
00:10:36.639 billion and uh interesting thing about
00:10:40.519 these earnings is they're after
00:10:42.519 depreciation and amortization and taxes
00:10:45.160 and all that sort of thing
00:10:46.920 so you can figure that essentially uh
00:10:52.399 berer has a little over hundred million
00:10:55.000 dollar per day including weekends and
00:10:57.920 holidays
00:10:59.519 coming in to uh
00:11:03.120 deploy and uh We've set out many times
00:11:06.760 when we're attempting to we're
00:11:08.600 attempting to deploy that money but but
00:11:11.000 we have that responsibility and uh um
00:11:15.480 sometimes if you'll turn to the next
00:11:18.079 page uh well you'll see how that's built
00:11:20.839 up the shareholders Equity so that
00:11:24.720 Berkshire uh had that March 31st 500 74
00:11:30.480 billion and uh
00:11:33.480 uh through retaining earnings and we've
00:11:36.200 been retaining
00:11:37.440 earnings ever since we took control of
00:11:39.800 Berkshire out the way
00:11:41.320 except one
00:11:43.279 day as I
00:11:45.600 remember I think it was maybe 1968 or n
00:11:49.320 i i the directors declared a 10 cent a
00:11:52.920 share dividend and I I think I must have
00:11:54.880 been in the restroom or something at the
00:11:56.560 time but uh uh so uh if you leave out
00:12:00.399 that period of Madness uh we've been
00:12:04.519 retaining our we've been saving your
00:12:06.279 money putting it to work and sometimes
00:12:10.680 sometimes we've done things that were
00:12:12.480 big mistakes and but but never we never
00:12:15.959 get close to fatal mistakes and every
00:12:17.760 now and then we do something that really
00:12:19.440 works and as Charlie pointed out in my
00:12:23.199 past you know it's
00:12:25.600 really there's probably been a
00:12:29.440 half a dozen
00:12:31.399 to a dozen over 57 or 58 or whatever it
00:12:35.720 would be uh really important big
00:12:38.920 decisions and there's been nothing close
00:12:40.680 to fatal uh so that continues to be the
00:12:46.560 guideline and uh uh we have accumulated
00:12:51.079 571 billion and I I couldn't help uh but
00:12:56.760 look at who's second and uh uh JP Morgan
00:13:02.199 Had 327 billion at year end and and
00:13:05.519 they're up to 338 I believe at end of
00:13:08.600 the quarter and but they pay significant
00:13:12.560 dividends they repurchase shares they've
00:13:14.839 got a business that earns better Returns
00:13:16.920 on Equity but they they don't plow it
00:13:21.000 and they shouldn't uh they don't plow it
00:13:22.959 back exactly like we have and it this
00:13:26.800 does show what can be done
00:13:30.199 uh really without any Miracles if you if
00:13:34.040 you save
00:13:35.079 money uh over time and uh we have a
00:13:39.399 group of shareholders we had a group of
00:13:41.880 Partners originally Charlie and I did
00:13:44.839 that wanted to save money and uh left
00:13:49.600 their money with like in that film you
00:13:53.079 just saw you saw Eddie and Dorothy Davis
00:13:55.920 and uh the Davis family and the children
00:13:59.440 and the
00:14:00.560 grandchildren uh periodically did some
00:14:04.079 other things with the money but they
00:14:05.480 also basically left it with us and and
00:14:08.560 we were a savings vehicle and uh they
00:14:12.279 were able to do live very well but they
00:14:16.199 weren't they weren't trying to to live
00:14:19.880 like the uh the kings and queens of
00:14:23.639 earlier capitalism and used to build the
00:14:27.720 houses and in uh uh New England and you
00:14:32.000 know have a servant but standing by and
00:14:34.440 everybody eating and all that sort of
00:14:36.160 things so we've had very few what I
00:14:38.720 would call look at
00:14:40.120 me uh type people that are attracted
00:14:43.000 there's nothing wrong with it but but uh
00:14:45.360 but they just go someplace else and uh
00:14:48.399 and they are
00:14:50.440 spending uh uh sort of unbelievable sums
00:14:55.279 after a while by the standards of the
00:14:57.880 past and our people nobody we've have
00:15:00.880 nobody that's a that's a miser or a
00:15:04.920 hoarder or anything like that in our
00:15:06.560 group they live very well but the math
00:15:09.360 of compounding and a long long
00:15:14.399 Runway uh have done wonders and we will
00:15:17.920 talk a little
00:15:20.000 later uh uh right before lunch we'll
00:15:23.839 we'll give an illustration of that of
00:15:26.079 what can be done with that sort of
00:15:28.240 philosophy
00:15:29.480 uh
00:15:31.399 so uh our cash and treasury bills were
00:15:34.279 182 billion at the quarter end and I
00:15:38.079 think it's a fair assumption uh that
00:15:42.639 they prob probably about 200
00:15:45.279 billion at the uh end of
00:15:49.440 the uh this
00:15:51.800 quarter um we'd love to spend it but we
00:15:55.240 won't spend it unless we think we're
00:15:57.600 doing something that
00:15:59.759 has very little risk and can make us a
00:16:02.199 lot of money and and uh uh and our stock
00:16:07.639 is at a level
00:16:10.120 where it's it's adds slightly to the
00:16:14.480 value when we buy in shares but we would
00:16:18.600 we would
00:16:20.160 really uh buy it in in a big way except
00:16:23.199 you can't buy it in a big way because
00:16:24.880 people don't want to sell it in a big
00:16:26.319 way uh but if under certain market
00:16:29.759 conditions we could deploy quite a bit
00:16:31.800 of money in in in uh repurchases and as
00:16:36.319 you'll see on the final
00:16:39.160 slide uh uh we have bought it in the
00:16:44.120 last five years uh we can't buy them
00:16:46.959 like a great many other companies
00:16:48.360 because it just doesn't doesn't trade
00:16:50.079 that way the volume isn't the same
00:16:52.000 because we have investors and we and the
00:16:56.160 investors the the people in this room
00:16:58.240 really
00:16:59.720 uh they don't think about selling they
00:17:02.199 probably I would hope many of you don't
00:17:04.400 even check the price daily uh or weekly
00:17:08.079 uh you know it uh the people who check
00:17:11.679 the price daily have not made the money
00:17:14.400 that the people have forgotten about it
00:17:17.319 basically have over the years uh um it
00:17:21.520 uh and that's sort of the story of
00:17:24.400 birkshire will try to increase operating
00:17:27.919 earnings
00:17:29.600 and uh we will try
00:17:32.000 to uh reduce shares when it makes sense
00:17:35.799 to do so and we will hope for an
00:17:38.440 occasional big
00:17:40.080 opportunity and we're quite satisfied
00:17:43.000 with the position we're in uh so with
00:17:48.760 that background I think we'll turn it
00:17:51.360 over
00:17:52.559 to uh Becky quick and we will
00:17:57.280 alternate questions between Becky and uh
00:18:01.919 those of you in the audience and uh uh
00:18:06.159 Becky you want to start with the first
00:18:07.559 question sure thanks Warren um let's
00:18:10.720 start just given what you mentioned
00:18:12.880 there was some news that came out in the
00:18:14.200 10q this morning it shows that Burkshire
00:18:16.520 sold another 115 million shares of Apple
00:18:19.960 in this last quarter that's berkshire's
00:18:21.679 largest holding and I I think in that
00:18:23.960 vein we'll start with a question from
00:18:25.320 Sherman lamb he is a 27-year-old
00:18:27.679 Berkshire hathway class shareholder uh
00:18:30.360 from Malaysia he asks um last year you
00:18:33.880 mentioned Coca-Cola and American Express
00:18:36.200 being Burkes two long duration partial
00:18:39.080 ownership positions and you spent some
00:18:41.520 time talking about the virt virtues of
00:18:43.799 both these wonderful businesses in your
00:18:45.440 recent shareholder letter I noticed that
00:18:47.799 you have excluded Apple from this group
00:18:49.600 of businesses have you or your
00:18:51.559 investment manager views of the
00:18:53.240 economics of Apple's business or its
00:18:55.120 attractiveness as an investment changed
00:18:57.159 since Berkshire first invested in
00:19:00.640 2016 uh no I would the but we have so
00:19:05.200 shares and uh I would say that at the
00:19:09.080 end of the year I would think it
00:19:10.760 extremely likely that that uh that uh
00:19:15.600 Apple is the largest common stock
00:19:18.280 holding we have
00:19:20.400 now one interesting thing is that uh
00:19:24.200 Charlie and
00:19:25.880 I uh looked at Common Stocks or
00:19:28.880 marketable equities or the things that
00:19:30.799 people love to look at as being uh
00:19:35.960 businesses and so when
00:19:40.000 we when we own a Dairy Queen or we own
00:19:43.080 whatever it may be uh we look at that as
00:19:45.799 a business and when we look own
00:19:48.159 Coca-Cola uh or American Express or
00:19:50.840 apple we look at that as a business now
00:19:54.799 we can
00:19:56.480 buy really wonderful company compies in
00:20:00.159 the market as businesses we can't buy
00:20:02.919 all of them I mean all of the their
00:20:05.200 shares we can't buy 90% or 80% or
00:20:07.720 anything like that but when we look at
00:20:09.600 Coca-Cola and American Express and apple
00:20:12.080 we look at them as businesses now
00:20:14.679 there's differences in tax factors
00:20:17.280 there's difference in manage of
00:20:18.960 responsibility a whole bunch of things
00:20:20.480 but in terms of deploying your
00:20:23.159 money
00:20:25.039 uh we always look at every stock as a
00:20:28.720 business and we don't we have no way no
00:20:32.520 attempt made to predict markets we have
00:20:35.320 no attempt made to uh uh pick stocks I
00:20:41.200 went through many many years uh doing
00:20:44.240 the wrong thing uh I got interested in
00:20:47.600 stocks very early and I was fascinated
00:20:50.440 by them and uh and I wasn't wasting my
00:20:55.400 time because I was reading every book
00:20:57.440 possible and everything else but finally
00:20:59.799 I picked up a copy of the intelligent
00:21:02.799 investor in Lincoln and and there was a
00:21:05.600 few sentences in there that that said
00:21:08.600 much more eloquently than I can say it
00:21:10.679 but if you look at stocks as a business
00:21:14.760 and treat the market as something that's
00:21:18.000 doesn't tell you isn't there to instruct
00:21:20.720 you but it's there to serve you uh
00:21:24.880 you'll
00:21:26.039 do a lot better over time
00:21:29.720 uh then if you try to take charts and
00:21:32.720 listen to people talk about moving
00:21:34.360 averages and look at the F
00:21:37.760 pronouncements and all of that sort of
00:21:39.480 thing and so that made a lot of sense to
00:21:42.600 me that and the way
00:21:44.960 I'm we have been allowed to deploy it
00:21:49.279 Charlie and I talked about this of
00:21:50.880 course
00:21:51.799 constantly uh it's changed over the
00:21:54.840 years as the amount of capital we have
00:21:56.840 in the has changed done all of that but
00:21:59.520 the the basic principle was was laid out
00:22:03.640 by Ben
00:22:04.720 Graham in that book which uh I picked up
00:22:08.279 for a couple of dollars and uh and which
00:22:11.559 basically said to me you've been wasting
00:22:13.279 your time now but maybe you can use what
00:22:15.200 you've learned or been reading about and
00:22:18.520 put it to better use and then Charlie
00:22:20.200 came along and told me how to put it to
00:22:21.640 even better use and that's sort of the
00:22:24.919 uh story of why we own American Express
00:22:28.760 which is a wonderful business we own
00:22:30.559 Coca-Cola which is a wonderful business
00:22:32.840 and we own Apple which is an even better
00:22:36.240 business uh but uh uh and we will
00:22:42.559 own let something really extraordinary
00:22:46.200 happens we will own apple on American
00:22:48.279 Express in
00:22:49.480 Coca-Cola uh uh when Greg takes over
00:22:52.760 this place and and
00:22:55.400 uh uh it's
00:22:59.320 it it it's such a simple approach that
00:23:01.360 it's almost deceptive you most things if
00:23:03.880 you keep working harder and harder at it
00:23:06.039 you know you learn a little more math or
00:23:07.799 you learn a little more physics but
00:23:10.559 Investments you don't really have to do
00:23:12.120 that you really have to have your your
00:23:15.240 mindset properly so so we will we will
00:23:19.559 end up andless something dramatically
00:23:22.640 happens that really changes Capital
00:23:25.600 allocation uh strategy and uh uh we we
00:23:31.559 will uh we will have apple as our
00:23:34.960 largest
00:23:36.240 investment uh but I don't mind at all
00:23:39.960 under current conditions building
00:23:43.919 uh the uh cash position I think uh when
00:23:49.120 I look at the alternative of what's
00:23:51.120 available in the equity markets and I
00:23:53.840 look at the composition of what's going
00:23:56.039 on in the world uh uh we find it quite
00:24:00.480 attractive and one one thing that may
00:24:03.000 surprise you but uh uh
00:24:08.840 we almost everybody I know pays a lot
00:24:12.360 more
00:24:13.320 attention
00:24:14.919 uh to not paying taxes uh uh and I think
00:24:20.039 they should uh uh uh it we we we we
00:24:27.000 don't mind paying taxes at
00:24:30.200 Berkshire and we are paying a 21%
00:24:33.919 federal rate let the gains were taking
00:24:38.080 in in uh apple and
00:24:43.200 uh that rate was 35% not that long ago
00:24:46.600 and it's been 52% in the in the past uh
00:24:50.559 when I've been operating and uh
00:24:54.240 it uh the government owns
00:24:58.640 the federal government owns a
00:25:02.159 part of the earnings of the business we
00:25:05.000 make they don't own the assets but they
00:25:07.399 own a percentage of the
00:25:09.159 earnings and uh uh they can change that
00:25:14.000 percentage any year and the percentage
00:25:16.799 that they've decreed currently is 21%
00:25:20.919 and I would say with the present fiscal
00:25:24.880 policies uh I think that
00:25:29.120 something has to give and I think that
00:25:32.200 the higher taxes are are quite likely
00:25:36.880 and
00:25:38.559 uh the government wants to take a
00:25:41.039 greater share of your income or mine or
00:25:44.480 bures uh they can do it and uh uh they
00:25:50.799 may decide that someday they don't want
00:25:53.200 the fiscal deficit to be this large
00:25:55.320 because that has some important
00:25:57.120 consequences and they may not want to
00:25:59.080 decrease spending a lot and they may
00:26:00.880 decide they'll take a larger percentage
00:26:04.000 of what we earn and we'll pay it and we
00:26:09.080 always hope at Berkshire to pay
00:26:13.880 substantial federal income taxes we
00:26:16.399 think it's appropriate that a company a
00:26:19.240 country that's been as has been as
00:26:22.440 generous to our
00:26:24.360 owners it's it's been the place I was
00:26:27.919 luy Berkshire was lucky was here and uh
00:26:31.960 uh if we if we send in a check like we
00:26:35.640 did last year we sent in over5 billion
00:26:38.360 to the US federal government and if 800
00:26:41.440 other companies had done the same thing
00:26:44.360 no other person in the United States
00:26:46.760 would have had to pay a dime of federal
00:26:50.760 taxes whether income taxes
00:26:58.600 no social security taxes no estate taxes
00:27:01.559 no it's open and down the line now
00:27:04.919 that's that's
00:27:07.720 uh I would I would like
00:27:10.039 to I I hope things develop well enough
00:27:12.840 with Burkshire that we we say we're in
00:27:16.679 the 800 club and uh and maybe even move
00:27:19.960 up a few notches uh it doesn't bother me
00:27:22.760 in the least uh to write that check and
00:27:27.360 uh I would really hope with the all of
00:27:29.520 America's done for all of you shouldn't
00:27:31.840 bother you that we do it and if if I'm
00:27:34.720 doing it at 21% this year and we're
00:27:36.919 doing it at a higher percentage later on
00:27:39.799 I don't think you'll actually mind the
00:27:42.120 the fact that uh we sold a little apple
00:27:44.399 this
00:27:45.320 year okay let's go to section
00:27:53.159 one hi Mr Buffett this is Matthew Li
00:27:56.399 from China Hong Kong I'm running my last
00:27:58.919 listing company called fop fop and we
00:28:01.880 are so grateful that you learn from you
00:28:03.799 and you really Inspire us my question is
00:28:07.279 besides the electrical Car Company
00:28:10.559 B under what circumstances you will
00:28:14.039 reinvest and reconsider to invest Hong
00:28:17.120 Kong and China company thank you yeah
00:28:23.600 well uh our primary
00:28:26.320 investments will always be in in the
00:28:28.279 United States uh we do think
00:28:36.960 it now the companies we invest in the
00:28:39.840 United States American Express does
00:28:41.279 business around the world and no company
00:28:42.919 hardly does business around the world
00:28:44.360 like Coca-Cola I mean
00:28:48.120 they're they are the
00:28:51.720 preferred uh soft
00:28:54.399 drink you know something maybe like1 70
00:28:58.600 or 180 out of 200 company 200
00:29:02.000 countries those are rough approximations
00:29:04.559 from few years back probably but
00:29:07.919 but that degree of
00:29:11.200 acceptance worldwide
00:29:13.720 is uh I think it's almost unmatched I
00:29:18.399 can't really think of any company that
00:29:20.440 has it American
00:29:22.080 Express uh has a
00:29:26.000 position uh and
00:29:29.279 the uh credit card bill which I think is
00:29:35.559 extremely strong and um uh and part of
00:29:41.600 that was one of the director part of the
00:29:43.000 reasons for that is one of the directors
00:29:44.760 that introduced a few few minutes ago
00:29:48.640 Ken chanol but it it is it is
00:29:52.720 strengthen dramatically over the last 20
00:29:55.279 years for a lot of reasons uh so we
00:29:59.360 will the the byd
00:30:02.760 investment was
00:30:04.880 a
00:30:07.480 uh and well we we made we made the
00:30:10.880 commitment in Japan which I did 5 years
00:30:12.960 ago and and that was just overwhelmingly
00:30:16.559 was
00:30:17.440 compelling uh it was extraordinarily
00:30:21.120 compelling and we put we bought it as
00:30:23.720 fast as we could and we spent a year and
00:30:28.080 you know we got a few percent of our
00:30:29.600 Assets in five very big companies but
00:30:32.320 that's the problem of being our size but
00:30:35.799 you won't find us
00:30:37.480 making a lot of
00:30:40.279 Investments uh outside the United States
00:30:43.240 although we're participating through
00:30:45.000 these other companies in the world
00:30:48.360 economy uh but I
00:30:52.799 understand uh the United States rules
00:30:57.159 weaknesses strengths whatever it may
00:31:00.320 be I I don't I don't have the same
00:31:03.600 feeling for for uh economies generally
00:31:07.679 out around the world I don't I don't
00:31:09.600 pick up on other cultures extremely well
00:31:12.880 and and lucky thing is I don't have to
00:31:16.000 because you know I don't live in some
00:31:18.760 tiny little country that has no uh just
00:31:21.960 doesn't have a big economy but got I'm
00:31:24.320 in an economy already that has uh you
00:31:27.559 know
00:31:29.559 after starting out with a half a percent
00:31:32.279 of the world's population has ended up
00:31:34.279 with well over 20% of the world's output
00:31:37.440 in in an amazingly short period of time
00:31:40.720 so so I we will we will be American
00:31:45.440 oriented uh uh I mean if if we do
00:31:49.559 something really big it's extremely
00:31:51.399 likely to be in the United States uh
00:31:56.679 Charlie uh uh in all those years there's
00:31:59.799 only two times he's told me that you
00:32:04.240 know this one is really you know he he
00:32:08.200 would he would always go along with me
00:32:10.360 and you know and say well when I was
00:32:12.840 suggesting something say well this is
00:32:15.840 really not that great but but it's
00:32:18.200 probably the best you'll come up with so
00:32:20.120 I'll go along with the
00:32:21.600 idea and uh but Charlie Charlie twice
00:32:24.799 has pounded the table with me and just
00:32:26.600 said you know
00:32:29.000 uh uh by bye bye and uh byd was one of
00:32:34.200 them and and Costco was the other and uh
00:32:37.639 we bought a certain amount of Costco we
00:32:40.799 bought quite a bit of byd but but uh but
00:32:45.159 looking
00:32:46.320 back
00:32:49.240 uh I he already was as aggressive but I
00:32:52.799 should have been more aggressive uh in
00:32:55.399 in Costco it wasn't fatal that we
00:32:57.960 weren't but but he was
00:32:59.919 right big time in both companies and uh
00:33:06.799 uh I will I'm aware of what goes on in
00:33:11.000 most markets
00:33:13.679 but I think it's unlikely that that we
00:33:17.320 make
00:33:18.200 any large
00:33:20.600 commitments uh in almost any country you
00:33:23.519 can name although you know we don't rule
00:33:26.360 it out entirely and uh I feel extremely
00:33:29.799 good about our Japanese position and
00:33:31.679 we'll have
00:33:33.159 that um I don't know how many
00:33:36.960 years Greg will be sitting with that at
00:33:39.440 some point and and we couldn't be
00:33:42.240 happier with that but you really have to
00:33:45.760 we really have a different
00:33:47.840 Outlook in looking at at at well we look
00:33:52.480 at your money which we couldn't bear to
00:33:55.200 lose and we feel that we we're bar less
00:33:59.399 likely to make any truly major mistakes
00:34:03.440 in the United States than in many other
00:34:06.320 countries okay
00:34:08.599 Becky uh this next question comes from
00:34:11.239 Stanley Holmes who is a Berkshire
00:34:13.760 shareholder from Salt Lake City he asks
00:34:16.879 in his 2024 annual letter to
00:34:18.960 shareholders chairman Buffett noted the
00:34:20.918 severe earnings disappointment
00:34:22.679 experienced at Berkshire hathway energy
00:34:24.839 last year and expressed concern about
00:34:26.560 earnings and asset values in the utility
00:34:29.320 industry recognizing that investors are
00:34:31.918 worried about climate change related
00:34:33.520 expenses and that new uncertainties
00:34:35.879 Cloud the regulatory environment the
00:34:38.280 chairman suggested that some
00:34:39.719 jurisdictions may adopt the Public Power
00:34:42.119 model there are now signs that policy
00:34:44.679 makers in Utah stating uh citing state
00:34:47.440 sovereignity may already be poised to
00:34:49.480 move in that direction the Utah
00:34:51.520 legislature recently mandated the
00:34:53.599 state's right to serve as sole purchaser
00:34:55.560 of energy from an instate power plant
00:34:58.200 and under some some circumstances
00:35:00.079 purchase the power plant before it can
00:35:01.680 be retired the state utility regulator
00:35:04.359 will be legally bound to prioritize
00:35:06.480 public purchases of power and Facilities
00:35:08.520 that could include assets owned by
00:35:10.400 Burkshire haway energy specific work
00:35:12.400 utility Rocky Mountain Power will
00:35:15.160 Burkshire through bhe continue to invest
00:35:17.839 resources in jurisdictions where
00:35:19.640 corporate assets may be subject to
00:35:21.520 confiscatory State policies and actions
00:35:24.560 and how is Berkshire energy working with
00:35:26.680 officials in Utah to minimize potential
00:35:28.800 corporate losses if and when State
00:35:30.960 control is asserted over its electrical
00:35:33.119 utility sector yeah I will Greg join
00:35:36.839 with me in the answer on this but I
00:35:39.720 would say our our feeling is that Utah
00:35:42.520 is
00:35:43.680 actually very likely to treat us fairly
00:35:47.040 whether the action is in in granting
00:35:51.240 appropriate rates that give us the
00:35:53.680 return we expected generally expected in
00:35:56.800 in terms of Our Own Properties or if
00:35:58.599 they decide for some reason to go to
00:36:01.319 Public Power I think they would
00:36:02.920 compensate us fairly uh
00:36:07.000 uh in the 1930s George Norris the
00:36:10.160 senator from Nebraska just turned
00:36:13.079 Nebraska into a public power State and
00:36:17.359 uh our experience in
00:36:20.839 Iowa uh would indicate that that uh free
00:36:25.640 enterprise has its role and that uh uh
00:36:31.079 we can run
00:36:33.680 a
00:36:36.920 a privately owned uh utility
00:36:41.359 company uh that will be more efficient
00:36:43.880 for society than at least in Most states
00:36:47.160 people can do uh with Public Power uh
00:36:51.880 but what has happened is
00:36:54.520 that there's going to be enormous amount
00:36:57.760 money enormous amounts of money uh spent
00:37:01.880 on power uh and we've been we're if
00:37:06.720 you're going to do it with with uh uh
00:37:11.560 private owners there's nobody better
00:37:13.880 situated than
00:37:15.920 Berkshire to
00:37:20.000 satisfy
00:37:22.319 the the portion but a large portion of
00:37:27.119 the need needs of the country and and we
00:37:30.000 will do it at at at a rate of return
00:37:34.960 that
00:37:36.040 is is not you know it's not designed to
00:37:40.000 make us make us rich or anything like
00:37:44.160 that it's it's it's a sensible rate of
00:37:46.560 return
00:37:48.400 but uh we won't do it if we think we're
00:37:51.599 not going to get any return it' be kind
00:37:53.160 of crazy and
00:37:55.599 uh uh we've seen actions in a few states
00:38:00.760 where
00:38:02.319 uh
00:38:04.400 there some of the costs associated with
00:38:08.800 climate change are not being regarded as
00:38:12.960 as uh cost of the utility shouldn't
00:38:15.960 incur well believe me if it was publicly
00:38:17.720 owned they would have incurred it too
00:38:19.440 but but we will We the wood Society
00:38:22.880 tells us and we have got the money and
00:38:26.119 we've got we've the knowledge to
00:38:28.960 participate big in something that is
00:38:31.119 enormously important for the country but
00:38:33.480 we're not going to do we're not going to
00:38:36.440 we're not going to throw good money
00:38:38.319 after after bad and field I don't worry
00:38:42.920 about my understanding is and Greg can
00:38:46.240 elaborate on this now immediately uh but
00:38:49.000 I don't regard Utah as uh being
00:38:53.359 unfriendly uh to the idea of utilities
00:38:56.240 being treated fairly
00:38:58.480 Charlie Charlie I'm so
00:39:00.570 [Laughter]
00:39:03.110 [Applause]
00:39:10.000 used I had actually checked myself a
00:39:12.680 couple times already
00:39:14.480 but I'll slip I'll slip
00:39:17.200 again that's a a great honor word um
00:39:21.200 yeah when we well War you touched on it
00:39:23.880 initially in your letter uh relative to
00:39:27.119 the
00:39:28.000 the challenges in the industry and then
00:39:29.720 you've just alluded to the significant
00:39:31.520 investment that has to go into the
00:39:34.720 energy industry the utility sector for
00:39:37.560 for many years to come and and I think
00:39:40.280 if we start there if I think of our
00:39:42.839 different utilities and will definitely
00:39:44.640 come to to Utah and Pacific Corp but if
00:39:47.640 you look at the underlying demand that
00:39:50.599 is building in each of those utilities
00:39:53.440 and the amount of dollars that are going
00:39:55.119 to have to go in to meet that demand
00:39:58.240 it's absolutely incredible so when you
00:40:00.640 raised it in your letter it's a really
00:40:02.560 important issue we have to have a
00:40:04.400 regulatory compact that works between if
00:40:08.040 it's a public utility it has to work in
00:40:11.480 in concert with the the state Utah being
00:40:14.520 an example or It ultimately becomes
00:40:18.079 potentially a public power entity so if
00:40:21.720 just to just to set the the frame a
00:40:24.200 little bit if I think of Iowa which you
00:40:27.040 meant mentioned and the underlying we've
00:40:29.440 made substantial Investments there it's
00:40:31.640 been very consistent with both the the
00:40:34.960 public policy that the state and
00:40:37.079 legislator wanted and they enacted very
00:40:39.920 specific laws to encourage that but that
00:40:43.280 utility is more than a hundred years old
00:40:45.760 right now and if we look at the
00:40:49.119 demand that's in place for Mid-American
00:40:52.400 Iowa Iowa utility over the next say into
00:40:56.040 the mid 2030
00:40:58.200 um associated with AI and the data
00:41:01.440 centers that that demand doubles in that
00:41:05.440 short period of time and that happen and
00:41:08.520 it took a hundred years plus to get
00:41:10.359 where we are today and now it's going to
00:41:12.920 double and for and that will require
00:41:16.560 substantial amounts of capital from the
00:41:19.760 from Mid-American and its shareholders
00:41:22.480 and how that will function is if we have
00:41:24.280 a proper regulatory compact in place
00:41:26.720 which which you've highlighted if we
00:41:30.040 then go to say
00:41:32.160 Nevada where we we own two utilities
00:41:35.880 there uh and and cover the lon share in
00:41:38.680 Nevada if you go over a similar time
00:41:41.280 frame and you look at the underlying
00:41:42.920 demand in in that
00:41:45.280 utility uh and say go into the later
00:41:49.960 2030s it
00:41:52.319 triples the the underlying demand and
00:41:55.319 billions and billions of dollars have to
00:41:57.560 be put in our rate basee will literally
00:42:00.839 go from um uh it's not a modest level
00:42:05.880 now uh but you're talking uh probably an
00:42:09.599 incremental 6 to 10 billion at least of
00:42:12.000 rate base going into that type of entity
00:42:14.760 which requires um again alignment with
00:42:18.040 the the state and their policies and a
00:42:20.480 proper recovery of our underlying both
00:42:22.640 capital and uh a return on Capital so
00:42:26.599 when we come to the wildfires that's
00:42:28.680 been a substantial challenge because
00:42:31.280 it's the first time there's been a lot
00:42:33.559 of discussion
00:42:35.040 around one of our utilities one
00:42:38.400 experienced significant losses
00:42:40.040 associated with the the the wildfires
00:42:43.559 what portion of those costs will be
00:42:46.359 recovered and that's really the the
00:42:49.119 dialogue we're in and does that properly
00:42:52.480 properly work uh when I think of the
00:42:56.000 wildfires
00:42:57.599 were there's been many claims and a a
00:43:00.319 recent additional claim last week for
00:43:04.319 $30 billion do and it's we we don't take
00:43:07.040 that lightly but it is an incremental
00:43:09.760 claim to an already existing lawsuit
00:43:12.040 that's in place and when I think of
00:43:14.319 Pacific Corp we're we're in a place
00:43:17.160 where um first and
00:43:19.760 foremost all the litigation will be
00:43:23.000 challenged because the basis for it um
00:43:26.960 uh uh uh at least we believe there's
00:43:30.160 places where it's un unfounded and we'll
00:43:32.200 continue to challenge it uh and it will
00:43:35.079 take many years to be resolved as as
00:43:37.359 Warren highlighted in the letter but if
00:43:39.559 you think of Pacific Corp uh and the
00:43:42.359 litigation there um number
00:43:46.000 one how we how we think and operate
00:43:49.040 those assets have to change because
00:43:51.839 we've had a regul we we have worked with
00:43:54.319 the states across all our states for
00:43:56.640 many years years with the fundamental
00:43:58.920 goal to be to keep the power
00:44:01.319 on and our our teams and our employees
00:44:04.520 worked incredibly hard to keep the power
00:44:06.400 on day in day out through storms
00:44:09.640 unfortunately through the 2020 fires the
00:44:12.559 instincts were not to turn off the power
00:44:14.960 the Instinct was to keep the power on to
00:44:18.359 keep
00:44:19.440 hospitals uh fire stations responding am
00:44:24.680 it's not in their mind to or at least
00:44:26.680 cultur it wasn't in our minds to De
00:44:29.200 energize so the first thing we had to do
00:44:31.680 was step back and say we've got to
00:44:34.040 fundamentally change the culture not
00:44:36.480 just at Pacific courp but across all our
00:44:38.599 utilities the first thing we have to
00:44:40.640 recognize is that there's now going to
00:44:42.839 be uh situations where we prioritize
00:44:47.200 de-energizing the assets and that's
00:44:50.160 completely different than we've how
00:44:52.240 we've operated those assets as I've
00:44:54.680 highlighted for 100 plus years so we we
00:44:58.000 start with the culture we had to change
00:45:00.359 that the second thing is we've now
00:45:03.040 changed our operating systems so that we
00:45:05.800 can turn off the power very quickly if
00:45:08.119 there's a fire that's encroaching we
00:45:10.559 will turn off our systems now and we'll
00:45:14.000 go the minute the the the conditions are
00:45:17.000 safe again we'll re-energize it but
00:45:19.760 we've had to do that and then the uh
00:45:23.160 third thing is continuing to invest in a
00:45:25.359 way that uh allows us to try to minimize
00:45:28.760 the risk of the fire but when you get
00:45:30.880 back to Utah and Pacific Corp the
00:45:33.920 challenge we do have is within Pacific
00:45:36.359 Corp as we go through both litigation
00:45:39.520 and through continuing to operate that
00:45:42.359 entity it generates a certain amount of
00:45:45.640 of capital and profits that will remain
00:45:48.119 in that entity and be reinvested back
00:45:51.280 into that business but but
00:45:55.319 fundamentally as we go
00:45:57.520 forward we need both legislative and
00:46:00.880 Regulatory
00:46:02.319 reform across the Pacific Corp States if
00:46:05.839 we're if we're going to deploy
00:46:07.680 incremental Capital make incremental
00:46:10.559 contributions into that business as
00:46:12.839 waren said we don't want to uh throw
00:46:15.680 good Capital after um bad Capital so
00:46:19.599 we'll be very disciplined there but the
00:46:21.880 reality is there are opportunities to
00:46:25.119 both solve the the legislative and
00:46:28.079 Regulatory Solutions and the and the
00:46:30.680 best example we actually have and I
00:46:32.680 think it's the gold standard across the
00:46:34.960 country is Utah so as Warren touched on
00:46:38.680 it's a it's a state we're we're happy
00:46:41.240 we're investing in it is part of Pacific
00:46:43.839 corpse so there's a certain amount of
00:46:45.359 balance there as to how we do it but in
00:46:48.839 the last legislative session that that
00:46:52.119 existed Utah actually passed a bill that
00:46:55.920 does a couple very important things one
00:46:59.559 it caps non-economic damages on Wildfire
00:47:05.160 claims so if you go back to the
00:47:07.319 wildfires we have in
00:47:09.760 Oregon um and the claims you're hearing
00:47:12.960 filed
00:47:14.079 for there's economic damages associated
00:47:17.400 with them and and those harms should
00:47:19.599 receive the economic damages associated
00:47:22.000 with that but
00:47:23.599 unfortunately and even though there's
00:47:25.559 legislature and and case law in Oregon
00:47:28.240 that says um wildfire non-economic
00:47:32.200 damages should not be awarded there's
00:47:34.880 very substantial non-economic damages
00:47:37.599 being awarded there Utah took a very
00:47:40.440 proactive position to say we will cap
00:47:43.440 those non-economic damages and it
00:47:46.200 creates an environment again it's back
00:47:47.920 to that is there an environment where
00:47:49.559 you want to invest in yes and then and
00:47:53.040 then incrementally they've created a
00:47:56.000 very substantial fund it's a literally
00:47:59.119 called the Wildfire fund for for fires
00:48:01.480 in Utah that will help facilitate both
00:48:05.119 liquidity and the ability to resolve the
00:48:07.920 situation so Utah We Believe including
00:48:11.640 the legislation that um a lot of other
00:48:14.400 things came out of it is the actual gold
00:48:17.200 standard as we go forward so very
00:48:19.839 important issue for Berkshire haway
00:48:23.160 energy uh but at the same time it is a
00:48:26.240 Pacific
00:48:28.079 issue the the risk of regulatory
00:48:31.440 compacts not being respected a much
00:48:33.880 broader one that will always evaluate
00:48:36.359 and be careful how we deploy our Capital
00:48:38.520 but um both Pacific orp will manage
00:48:41.480 through it and I see other very good and
00:48:44.240 significant opportunities in Pacific cor
00:48:47.520 uh I mean in uh Berkshire hathway energy
00:48:50.400 the the return on the return on Equity
00:48:53.880 investment it's been
00:48:57.720 been promulgated and been achieved over
00:49:00.559 the years has been particularly in
00:49:03.280 recent years well below the return on
00:49:06.119 Equity that has been achieved by
00:49:08.359 American industry generally and so
00:49:14.920 uh the whether whether you earn X or X
00:49:19.359 plus a half a percent or x minus a half
00:49:21.880 a percent that differs by state and some
00:49:25.760 states are more attract active another
00:49:28.280 but whether you earn X or go broke is
00:49:34.200 not an equation that works and uh you
00:49:38.240 know we're we won't we won't put our
00:49:40.839 shareholders um money they didn't give
00:49:43.559 it to us to lose it all and uh uh we
00:49:49.200 might like it if it's better when it's X
00:49:51.599 plus a half a per and x minus a half a
00:49:53.680 percent but the electric utility
00:49:55.680 industry will never be as good as uh I
00:49:58.520 mean just remotely as good as you know
00:50:00.839 the kind of businesses we own in other
00:50:03.760 Arenas I mean you look at the return on
00:50:05.640 tangible Equity at at Coca-Cola or
00:50:09.960 American Express
00:50:11.720 or and to really top it off Apple uh it
00:50:16.720 it's just it's you know it's it's just a
00:50:19.799 whole different game but in utility the
00:50:21.839 trade has been and the the the compact
00:50:25.720 has been that you get get a a modest
00:50:29.720 return and uh uh climate change comes
00:50:34.200 along and it causes way more
00:50:36.599 fires uh that's just a cost of doing
00:50:39.960 business and doesn't mean that we can't
00:50:42.920 do things to
00:50:44.200 mitigate uh fires in the future and you
00:50:47.680 can make different policies on when you
00:50:49.640 turn off the lights but somebody's going
00:50:52.000 to do somebody's going to put
00:50:54.599 up many many hundred of billions maybe
00:50:58.040 in the trillions and climate change
00:51:00.799 enters into that and uh it can be done
00:51:05.000 through Public Power or it can be done
00:51:07.240 through private Enterprise to quite a
00:51:11.440 degree uh and we would be certainly good
00:51:14.720 for 100 billion or more but we're not
00:51:18.440 going to throw good money after
00:51:21.960 bad okay let's do um station
00:51:33.720 for hi I'm Joe visiting from San
00:51:36.400 Francisco how do you think about the
00:51:38.079 role of technological advances
00:51:39.960 especially generative AI on more
00:51:41.760 traditional Industries thank you yeah I
00:51:45.440 made a mistake in calling on four but
00:51:47.040 I'll get back to two later on the uh the
00:51:50.839 uh I don't know anything about about
00:51:55.040 AI uh
00:51:57.160 but I do I do have I don't that doesn't
00:52:01.040 mean I deny its existence or importance
00:52:03.079 or anything of the sort and and last
00:52:05.200 year I said you know
00:52:06.799 that we let a genie out of the bottle
00:52:09.359 when we when we developed nuclear
00:52:12.799 weapons and that Genie has been doing
00:52:16.119 some terrible things lately and the
00:52:20.079 power of that Genie is would you know
00:52:22.680 scares the hell out of me and under that
00:52:26.040 I don't know way to get the genie back
00:52:27.640 in the bottle and AI is somewhat similar
00:52:31.160 it it's out it's part way out of the
00:52:33.480 bottle and and uh it's enormously
00:52:36.200 important and it's going to be done by
00:52:37.680 somebody so uh we may wish we'd never
00:52:41.760 seen that Genie or may do wonderful
00:52:44.760 things and I'm certainly not the person
00:52:46.559 that can evaluate that and I probably
00:52:49.319 wouldn't have been the person that could
00:52:50.520 have evaluated during World War Two
00:52:54.160 whether we tested the 20 th000
00:52:57.480 ton a bomb that we felt was absolutely
00:53:02.040 necessary for the for the United States
00:53:05.319 and would actually save lives in the
00:53:07.920 long run but where we also had Edmund
00:53:11.400 teller I think it was it was on a
00:53:13.079 parallel with Einstein in terms of
00:53:15.240 saying you may with this test ignite the
00:53:19.760 atmosphere in such a way that
00:53:21.559 Civilization doesn't continue and we
00:53:25.200 decided to let the gene of the bottle
00:53:27.240 and it accomplished the immediate
00:53:29.760 objective but whether whether it's going
00:53:32.559 to change the future Society we will
00:53:36.280 find out later now
00:53:38.440 ai I had one
00:53:40.960 experience that does make me a little
00:53:44.839 nervous and I'll just explain it that
00:53:47.799 very very
00:53:49.599 recently uh fairly recently I uh I saw a
00:53:57.520 uh an image in front of my eyes on the
00:54:01.359 screen and it was it was me and it was
00:54:05.799 my
00:54:06.640 voice and wearing the kind of clothes I
00:54:10.200 wear
00:54:11.880 and my wife or my daughter wouldn't have
00:54:14.720 been able to detect any difference and I
00:54:17.440 was delivering a message that no way
00:54:20.119 came from me so it when you think of the
00:54:24.799 potential for scamming
00:54:26.960 people if you
00:54:29.200 can
00:54:32.440 reproduce images that I can't even tell
00:54:36.079 let's say I need money you know I'm you
00:54:39.559 know it's your daughter I've just had a
00:54:41.880 had a uh car crash I need throw $50,000
00:54:47.280 wired I mean scamming has always been
00:54:49.119 part of the American scene uh but this
00:54:53.760 would make me
00:54:56.680 if I was interested in investing and
00:54:58.920 scamming it's going to be the growth
00:55:00.799 industry of all time and it's enabled in
00:55:03.640 a way I now maybe you know obviously AI
00:55:06.480 has potential for good things too but I
00:55:09.240 don't know how you based on the one I
00:55:11.599 saw recently uh I practically would send
00:55:14.799 send money to myself over in some crazy
00:55:18.280 country it so uh I don't have any advice
00:55:23.599 on how the world handles it because I
00:55:26.039 don't think think we we know how to
00:55:28.079 handle what we did with the
00:55:30.400 nuclear uh Genie but I do
00:55:34.680 think as someone who doesn't understand
00:55:37.039 a damn thing about it that it
00:55:40.440 is it has enormous potential for good
00:55:44.520 and enormous potential for harm and I
00:55:47.960 just don't know how that plays
00:55:49.839 out uh i' I'd like to mention to Becky
00:55:53.160 that that a Jeet will will not be been
00:55:56.760 the the uh afternoon uh session so if
00:56:01.760 you could focus on any if there are
00:56:03.839 Insurance questions they want to ask
00:56:05.359 that be a good one yeah this next
00:56:08.079 question is for both Warren and AET um
00:56:11.240 it's from Ben NL who's a Minneapolis
00:56:13.640 shareholder who's been a shareholder
00:56:15.200 since 1995 and he says in an interview
00:56:18.119 this past year Todd col said that in
00:56:20.640 first meeting you in 2010 he told you
00:56:23.440 Geico is better at marketing and
00:56:25.319 branding but Progressive is a data
00:56:27.680 company and data is going to win in the
00:56:29.319 long run but it appears you did not
00:56:31.599 prioritize data analytics at Geico until
00:56:33.799 a decade later when you made Todd
00:56:36.079 CEO as business units like Geico age and
00:56:39.079 need new strategic direct Direction I
00:56:41.920 wonder if berkshire's hands-off
00:56:43.200 management approach is a source of
00:56:45.000 vulnerability will you please review
00:56:46.920 your thinking on changes made at Geico
00:56:48.960 and explain how Berkshire is structured
00:56:50.960 to react if the Burkshire CEO sees that
00:56:53.440 a business unit is strategically off
00:56:55.359 track and a g I hope you will continue
00:56:58.280 to update us on yours and Todd's
00:57:00.960 progress at remedying the data analytics
00:57:03.119 shortcomings at
00:57:05.920 Geico J would you like to yeah uh as
00:57:09.799 Warren has pointed out in the past one
00:57:13.000 of
00:57:13.960 the one of the drawbacks that Geico is
00:57:17.640 faced with it hasn't been doing as good
00:57:20.480 job as matching rate with risk and
00:57:23.920 segmenting and pricing product based on
00:57:26.480 the risk characteristics uh this has
00:57:28.799 been a disadvantage at Kao for a few
00:57:31.839 years now we are trying to still play
00:57:34.520 catchup technology is something that is
00:57:37.920 unfortunately a bottleneck But there
00:57:40.520 again we are making progress uh and
00:57:43.079 equally importantly we have hired people
00:57:45.920 who are much better than what they the
00:57:48.599 they inherited in terms of data
00:57:50.880 analytics and pricing and slicing data
00:57:53.880 so yes I recognize we still behind we're
00:57:57.359 taking steps to bridge the gap and
00:57:59.440 hopefully by the certainly by the end of
00:58:01.799 25 we should be able to be uh along with
00:58:05.079 the best of players when it comes to
00:58:06.799 data analytics whether it's pricing
00:58:09.119 whether it's claims or any other factor
00:58:11.920 that drives the economics of the
00:58:13.480 insurance
00:58:14.839 business I would add that equating rate
00:58:17.920 with risk obviously
00:58:20.640 is is important in every line of
00:58:23.880 insurance business I mean that's what
00:58:25.359 you're involved with us deciding whether
00:58:28.440 a given rate offers us the chance of the
00:58:33.799 probability that we will make a little
00:58:36.559 money on it and that that sometimes
00:58:40.640 we're only risking losing a little and
00:58:42.920 sometimes we're risking losing huge
00:58:44.839 amounts but but but Geico and and
00:58:50.200 Progressive has done a better job that
00:58:51.920 in that recently but but our fundamental
00:58:54.280 Advantage at Geico of course is that we
00:58:55.920 have lower costs than virtually anybody
00:58:58.760 and that cost Advantage has been
00:59:01.240 dramatic we've driven our underwriting
00:59:03.440 expense ratio below 10% and there's
00:59:08.119 there oh there's just very very very few
00:59:10.880 companies that can compete with that so
00:59:13.280 so it
00:59:14.720 isn't it's not it's not in the least a
00:59:17.200 survival question and it isn't even
00:59:20.839 exactly a profitability thing but you
00:59:23.520 know we would rather have x% of the
00:59:27.359 market and a half of x% but but uh we
00:59:34.440 roughly uh I think in the month of March
00:59:38.119 we we were just uh we didn't we didn't
00:59:41.720 lose policy holders and we got 16
00:59:44.359 million or whatever it is of them and
00:59:46.839 and we've got the lowest cost operations
00:59:49.240 so it's it's it's it's not a threat it's
00:59:53.400 not remotely a threat to survival it's
00:59:55.280 not a throat to it's not a threat to to
00:59:58.599 even profitability but on the other hand
01:00:00.640 we would like to be growing with with
01:00:04.079 something that is is the best model
01:00:08.000 around in the insurance business uh uh
01:00:12.520 of delivering at a low cost and we now
01:00:15.000 have a recognition that we didn't have
01:00:18.160 back when Leo Goodwin started in 1936
01:00:21.039 but the same principle that worked then
01:00:23.640 is that if you can offer somebody a good
01:00:26.039 product cheaper than the other guy and
01:00:29.400 and everybody PR has to buy it and it's
01:00:33.039 a big business you know it's very
01:00:35.599 attractive to be and and Geico is a very
01:00:39.000 attractive business and has got its
01:00:40.960 lowest cost thing and it does have to do
01:00:43.880 a better job of matching rate to risk
01:00:47.480 but but our low costs have have massed
01:00:52.400 the fact that for a while that we could
01:00:55.520 we could
01:00:56.760 do uh without progressing as much as we
01:01:01.039 should have in the matching of R to risk
01:01:04.599 and now Tod has been working intensively
01:01:07.160 at that and he's made a lot of progress
01:01:09.559 but there's there's still work to be do
01:01:12.720 be done but in the meantime we're not
01:01:14.960 going to shrink and uh uh and we're
01:01:19.359 going to we should make uh better
01:01:23.280 underrunning profits than most companies
01:01:25.440 in the AO Insurance
01:01:28.160 business okay I'm going to back up and
01:01:31.559 go to uh I think I left station two out
01:01:34.559 of it earlier
01:01:36.720 so do we have somebody there yeah good
01:01:40.520 morning my name is Sebastian zaror I'm
01:01:43.839 from Munich Germany but I have way is uh
01:01:48.760 very respective to company in Germany
01:01:52.160 and my question is who are your most
01:01:55.559 dressed
01:01:56.400 advisor today is it Ted and Todd is it
01:02:00.640 Greg and Aid is it your wife your
01:02:04.640 children and what do you value about
01:02:07.960 them thank you well it depends whether
01:02:11.200 they're advising me on money or on other
01:02:16.000 things I I trust my children and my wife
01:02:22.359 totally but that doesn't mean I ask them
01:02:25.119 what stars to why the uh uh but the know
01:02:32.880 I I
01:02:34.119 was in terms of managing
01:02:37.279 money uh there wasn't anybody better in
01:02:40.960 the world to talk to for you know many
01:02:43.760 many decades than Charlie and uh that
01:02:46.720 doesn't mean I didn't talk to other
01:02:48.480 people but if I didn't think I could do
01:02:51.720 it myself I wouldn't have done it I mean
01:02:54.640 it uh uh so I to some extent I talk to
01:02:59.640 myself uh on investments and and and I I
01:03:06.920 think my children have gotten a whole
01:03:08.319 lot wiser over the years and uh uh so I
01:03:12.920 listen them to on a lot of things uh I
01:03:18.200 listen to my my daughter on who to vote
01:03:21.720 for locally cuz she knows a lot more
01:03:23.599 about that than I do and uh and I'll
01:03:28.160 I'll listen to my wife on a lot of
01:03:31.160 things and I won't get into
01:03:34.640 details so it it uh it is it is
01:03:42.039 important if you don't live a life where
01:03:45.440 you surround yourself and limit yourself
01:03:49.359 to people you
01:03:51.000 trust uh it won't be much fun I mean I
01:03:55.039 literally have been in the position ever
01:03:58.240 since I was in my
01:03:59.640 20s of being able
01:04:03.720 to have people I trusted around me and
01:04:06.720 I've made mistakes occasionally but and
01:04:10.599 but they filter out over time you learn
01:04:14.119 and uh uh when I found Charlotte for
01:04:18.079 example and in all kinds of matters not
01:04:21.200 just
01:04:22.039 investment uh you know I knew I'd have
01:04:25.240 somebody that that uh well I'll put it
01:04:30.000 this way you can think about this
01:04:32.720 Charlie and all the years we worked
01:04:35.440 together not only never
01:04:37.760 once lied to me ever but he didn't even
01:04:41.319 shap things so that he told half lies or
01:04:44.200 quarter lies to sort of Stack the the
01:04:47.520 deck in the direction he wanted to go he
01:04:50.119 was he
01:04:52.319 absolutely he considered a
01:04:56.200 of utmost importance that he never lied
01:05:00.279 now that occasionally got him in trouble
01:05:02.000 at dinner parties or something if he he
01:05:04.480 said to the woman I really prefer the
01:05:06.240 way you used to do your hair the way
01:05:08.279 that somebody over across the room does
01:05:10.400 I mean he was but in terms of having a
01:05:14.839 partner I I I simply cannot think of a
01:05:18.640 conversation I ever had with Charlie
01:05:21.319 that in the least he misled me or shaped
01:05:23.880 it his way or anything of the sort so
01:05:26.599 when you get that in your life uh you
01:05:29.760 know you cherish those people and you
01:05:32.240 sort of forget about the
01:05:35.200 rest
01:05:42.640 okay okay uh this question is for a je
01:05:46.400 uh it comes from Mayer
01:05:48.319 baruka climate change seems to be
01:05:51.079 impacting the insurance industry heavily
01:05:53.319 with major players pulling out of
01:05:54.960 markets like California because of
01:05:56.880 wildfire and flooding risks combined
01:05:59.200 with payouts increasing how does Mr Jane
01:06:02.279 see this risk expanding to other regions
01:06:05.079 and how has the thesis on insurance
01:06:07.520 Investments changed because of it
01:06:11.559 yeah climate change climate risk is
01:06:14.520 certainly a factor that is become has
01:06:17.440 come into focus in a very very big way
01:06:19.440 more recently now the one thing that
01:06:21.799 mitigates the problem for us especially
01:06:23.880 in some of the reinsurance operations we
01:06:26.400 are in is our contractual liabilities
01:06:29.640 are limited to a year in most cases so
01:06:33.480 as a result of which at the end of a
01:06:35.119 year we get the opportunity to reprise
01:06:38.720 including the decision to get out of the
01:06:41.079 business all together if we don't like
01:06:42.799 the pricing in the business but the fact
01:06:45.279 that we are making bets that tie us down
01:06:47.960 to one year at a time certainly makes it
01:06:50.480 possible for us to stay in the business
01:06:52.599 longer term than we might have otherwise
01:06:56.079 because of climate change clearly prices
01:06:57.880 need to go up it is difficult to be very
01:07:01.799 scientific about how much the prices
01:07:04.240 need to go up they need to go up a lot
01:07:06.960 and we keep increasing prices and hope
01:07:09.520 we stay above the ahead of the curve but
01:07:12.000 that doesn't happen in noral cases The
01:07:14.359 Regulators don't make it any easier by
01:07:17.160 tying our feet to the ground and making
01:07:19.359 it difficult for us to withdraw from
01:07:22.400 certain territories or to make uh
01:07:24.599 dramatic changes in in the pricing of
01:07:26.240 certain products uh as a result of which
01:07:29.079 a number of insurance carriers including
01:07:30.760 ourselves have decided to not write
01:07:33.119 business in certain States I think The
01:07:35.680 Regulators are getting a little more
01:07:37.000 realistic about the and they waking up
01:07:40.480 to the fact that the that the insurance
01:07:42.440 carriers need to make some kind of a
01:07:44.880 return a decent return for us to keep
01:07:47.079 deploying our Capital it's a constant
01:07:49.680 battle back and forth It's
01:07:51.880 been against the capital providers these
01:07:54.880 last few years is but I think we're
01:07:57.039 coming back into balance if you look at
01:07:59.039 the results that have been recently
01:08:00.480 announced by the insurance carriers
01:08:02.640 everyone's now making record profits OB
01:08:05.440 obviously that will not last but
01:08:06.880 certainly for the next several months I
01:08:09.400 think the insurance industry in spite of
01:08:11.039 climate change in spite of
01:08:13.039 increased risk of fires and flooding
01:08:17.439 it's going to be an okay place to be
01:08:19.560 in yeah climate climate
01:08:22.520 change increases risks and you know it
01:08:27.399 it in the end it's it makes our business
01:08:30.799 bigger over time is but not if we if we
01:08:34.158 misprice them we'll also go broke but uh
01:08:38.399 but we do it one year at a time
01:08:40.399 overwhelmingly and uh and I would say
01:08:43.520 this I would I would rather have a Jeet
01:08:46.640 assessing this than any thousand under
01:08:48.839 writers or or Insurance managers in the
01:08:52.319 world I mean it the
01:08:56.000 the factors aren't you know well we'll
01:08:59.679 take Atlantic hurricanes that which
01:09:02.279 would be our probably our biggest risk
01:09:05.080 you know
01:09:06.040 the there's no question that you can
01:09:09.000 measure the temper temperature of the
01:09:11.040 water in the Atlantic and and uh you
01:09:15.198 know what more water does the Hurricanes
01:09:18.640 but you don't know what
01:09:20.399 necessarily whether that's good or bad
01:09:22.759 because it may cause them to turn fast
01:09:25.880 you know it may it may change the path
01:09:28.560 as well as the intensity and frequency
01:09:31.399 of of of of losses uh but we'll we'll
01:09:37.640 write it one year at a time and we'll
01:09:39.359 have Vegeta underwriting it and you know
01:09:41.520 we don't have to tell you what's going
01:09:42.799 to happen 5 years from now or 10 years
01:09:44.679 from now and uh uh people who don't have
01:09:49.520 sort
01:09:51.279 of analytical Insurance Minds that
01:09:55.440 comment on this subject
01:09:58.320 really don't expand our knowledge it's
01:10:03.520 it it's uh we get a lot of letters from
01:10:05.560 people that I'm sure have good IQs but
01:10:08.199 they they don't really know they they
01:10:11.920 don't understand the insurance business
01:10:13.840 and uh and they're not wrong I don't
01:10:16.239 think in my mind about climate
01:10:18.679 change but uh if there was no risk
01:10:22.000 there'd be no insurance business and and
01:10:24.440 we're in the business of evaluating it
01:10:27.159 and we do it one year at a time and
01:10:30.520 there's some exceptions where you can't
01:10:32.920 do it where your your uh decisions
01:10:36.520 extend for a long time in the future and
01:10:39.800 uh we try to avoid those but
01:10:43.400 again
01:10:45.239 uh you don't need a thousand people
01:10:49.760 analyzing water currents and you you
01:10:52.520 need you need one very very very smart
01:10:54.880 guy
01:10:55.960 and we've got
01:10:57.840 him okay yeah the the only thing I'd add
01:11:02.000 is that climate change much like
01:11:04.480 inflation Done Right can be a friend of
01:11:07.400 the risk
01:11:09.679 Bearer and it has been for
01:11:12.239 us if you look at Geico it had
01:11:16.440 175,000 policies roughly in 1950 and it
01:11:20.400 was getting roughly 40 bucks a car so
01:11:24.520 that was 7 Mill
01:11:25.960 of of
01:11:27.880 volume and you know now we have uh we're
01:11:33.280 getting over
01:11:35.320 $2,000 well all the advances in
01:11:39.760 technology and everything like that if
01:11:41.400 if we had been wetted to some formula
01:11:44.360 what we did with $40 we'd have had a
01:11:46.080 terrible business but but in effect by
01:11:48.760 making the cars much safer they've also
01:11:51.560 made them much more expensive to repair
01:11:53.800 and a whole bunch of things have
01:11:54.880 happened including inflation so now we
01:11:57.840 have a $40 billion Bill business from
01:12:00.520 something that was 7
01:12:01.960 million uh back when I uh called on it
01:12:06.920 so if if we'd operated in a
01:12:09.560 non-inflationary world Geo would not be
01:12:13.639 a a $40 billion
01:12:18.520 company okay we're we're now finally
01:12:21.560 coordinated to we station three I I
01:12:23.719 believe
01:12:27.760 hello hi everyone I were I'm Liam I'm 27
01:12:33.560 from Newark Ontario Canada I got invest
01:12:37.920 birkshire thanks to my dad who brought
01:12:40.040 me down to this meeting I'm so excited
01:12:42.040 to be here most 27 year-olds had Idols
01:12:45.400 who are rappers but instead my Idols are
01:12:48.480 Warren Charlie who will miss forever and
01:12:51.440 also your cousin Jimmy who unfortunately
01:12:54.000 had to go this year too it's been a
01:12:55.719 tough year as a Canadian similar with
01:12:58.840 Greg I always wonder about our Canadian
01:13:02.040 economy and what you think about the
01:13:03.920 Canadian economy we got some beat down
01:13:06.120 Bank stocks right now and I don't know
01:13:08.679 what your opinions on are on these and I
01:13:12.199 also wonder at in their '90s if the
01:13:15.440 rumors are true and you're still able to
01:13:18.080 eat McDonald's I like Fast Moon myself
01:13:20.719 but I always wonder at 93 he's still
01:13:23.600 able to eat those and enjoy the
01:13:26.159 Coca-Cola thanks Warren okay well we've
01:13:28.560 got a Canadian here so we'll let him
01:13:30.840 answer uh first part and uh and if you
01:13:34.719 if you if you watch me you'll see what I
01:13:36.840 I like to eat I
01:13:38.679 mean but go to it Greg okay um yeah well
01:13:43.639 we're we we are fortunate to have a
01:13:45.360 number of operations up in Canada um it
01:13:49.199 goes across many of our operating
01:13:50.960 entities and then as Warren touched on
01:13:53.760 all the businesses that we have a piece
01:13:55.520 of that we're invested in are are up in
01:13:57.679 Canada so the presence is significant
01:14:00.480 we're we're we're always looking at
01:14:02.600 making incremental Investments there
01:14:04.679 because it's a it's an environment we're
01:14:07.000 very comfortable with Warren touched on
01:14:09.600 understanding the US environment
01:14:11.679 business environment and and I would put
01:14:14.560 Canada equally in that uh bucket that we
01:14:18.440 understand it and would be comfortable
01:14:20.320 and I I would say the economy moves very
01:14:22.719 closely to the to the US so the result
01:14:25.280 we're seeing out of our various
01:14:27.239 businesses that report both the US and
01:14:29.679 Canadian operations aren't aren't
01:14:32.560 drastically different um and and there's
01:14:37.000 a few that we're on the energy side for
01:14:39.639 example we make very substantial
01:14:41.840 Investments up there in in Alberta but
01:14:44.679 again it's very consistent with how that
01:14:46.560 economy is growing and I would see it
01:14:48.159 being very consistent with what we see
01:14:51.199 here Warren anything to yeah no we we we
01:14:55.280 in canadi
01:14:56.520 when it obviously there aren't as many
01:14:59.920 big companies up there as there are in
01:15:01.440 the United States but but when we get a
01:15:05.239 I got one from Canada just the other day
01:15:07.120 that I sent over to Greg too that that
01:15:09.679 when when we see anything that's
01:15:11.560 suggesting an idea that's of a size
01:15:14.960 would interest here and meets other
01:15:18.199 requirements uh we don't have any
01:15:21.920 hesitancy about uh putting big money in
01:15:26.639 in in in in Canada that uh and there are
01:15:30.360 things we actually can do fairly well
01:15:34.840 that uh uh our candidate could you know
01:15:39.560 benefit from from berkshire's
01:15:43.159 participation we did it some years ago
01:15:45.960 not that many years ago but but uh there
01:15:49.080 was a financial institution up there and
01:15:51.560 and uh uh they had a problem and and
01:15:56.520 theyd had as I remember 30 plus you know
01:16:00.679 various other people that were kicking
01:16:03.239 it around and meanwhile the place was
01:16:05.600 getting close to the edge for not a
01:16:08.080 fundamental problem and uh Ted wler from
01:16:12.800 our office went up there I heard about
01:16:15.960 it on a Monday or something and Ted wler
01:16:18.679 went up there and we offered a solution
01:16:21.199 in a couple of days to something that
01:16:23.639 that was getting close to the brings so
01:16:26.400 it it we do not feel uncomfortable in
01:16:29.600 any way shape or form uh putting our
01:16:33.400 money into Canada in fact we're actually
01:16:35.840 uh we're actually looking at one thing
01:16:39.560 now uh and but you know they they still
01:16:44.280 have to meet our standards on terms of
01:16:46.360 what we get for our money but they but
01:16:48.560 they don't have a they don't have a
01:16:50.239 mental we don't have any mental blocks
01:16:52.920 about that country and of course there's
01:16:55.040 a lot of countries we don't understand
01:16:56.639 at all so so Canada it it's it's
01:17:00.320 terrific when you've got um a major
01:17:03.760 economy not the size of the US but a
01:17:06.040 major economy that that you absolutely
01:17:09.120 you you feel confident about operating
01:17:12.600 there okay
01:17:15.520 mecky Warren you just uh said that you'd
01:17:18.199 rather have a g running risk assessment
01:17:20.840 at the insurance operations than any
01:17:22.560 other thousand insurance adjusters in
01:17:24.360 the world so I'd like to follow up with
01:17:25.840 a question that came in from Mark
01:17:27.800 Blackley in Tulsa Oklahoma he said
01:17:30.360 Warren for years you have spoken about
01:17:32.320 the incredible impact a Jeet has had on
01:17:34.239 Burkshire you've often joked if you and
01:17:36.600 a Jeet are in a sinking boat and we can
01:17:38.400 only save one of you swim for swim to a
01:17:40.960 g while we often discuss plans for the
01:17:43.840 next CEO of Berkshire little is
01:17:45.840 mentioned on who will one day replace a
01:17:47.960 g how should we think about the future
01:17:50.600 of the birkshire insurance operations
01:17:52.639 given how challenging it may be to find
01:17:54.920 another AIT and uh like to hear ait's
01:17:57.679 thought on thoughts on this as well well
01:18:00.560 I would say we won't find another AET
01:18:03.480 but fortunately he's a good bit younger
01:18:06.639 than I am so I hope you have to worry a
01:18:09.280 little bit about me first before start
01:18:11.040 working by the
01:18:13.239 je uh uh
01:18:17.040 it we won't find another Jeep but we
01:18:20.639 have an
01:18:21.760 operation that he has created
01:18:24.960 and
01:18:26.000 that at least part of it is there
01:18:31.159 certain parts of it that are almost
01:18:35.120 impossible for competitors to imitate
01:18:39.360 and and if I was in their shoes I
01:18:41.320 wouldn't I wouldn't try and imitate them
01:18:45.639 uh and so we've
01:18:49.480 institutionalized some of our
01:18:51.880 advantages but a jet is
01:18:55.600 well he all his presence allowed us to
01:18:59.480 do it uh and he did it uh but now we've
01:19:07.000 we've created a
01:19:08.760 structure that uh didn't exist when he
01:19:11.480 came in 1986 nothing close to it existed
01:19:14.239 with us or with anybody else and uh
01:19:18.840 insurance is the most important
01:19:21.239 business at birkshire it it uh
01:19:25.760 uh marketable Securities are important
01:19:29.360 but uh they're not in the class exactly
01:19:34.159 as as our insurance business uh uh and
01:19:40.199 uh a
01:19:43.159 g we we won't have the same business if
01:19:46.000 a g isn't running it but we'll have a
01:19:48.679 very good business and again that thanks
01:19:51.600 to a g you know I'd been in the business
01:19:55.120 when he came in
01:19:57.600 1986 you know I'd first went to Geico in
01:20:01.440 1950 we first bought National Indemnity
01:20:04.120 in
01:20:05.400 1957 and it was something that we' made
01:20:07.760 quite a b bit of money in the stocks of
01:20:10.880 of insurance companies but uh
01:20:16.159 uh we needed we needed an je
01:20:20.199 unfortunately he came into the office on
01:20:22.000 a Saturday and he was
01:20:26.239 tired of working at something where he
01:20:28.679 really
01:20:31.360 didn't it just in challenges his
01:20:34.800 intellect and uh I said well we got a
01:20:37.960 lot of challenges so you know you know
01:20:41.120 nobody's perfect so so you've never seen
01:20:43.440 an insurance policy own an insurance
01:20:46.320 stock but here are the keys and that's
01:20:49.159 worked out very well
01:20:58.719 well thank you very much Warren than
01:21:01.840 thank you very much everyone but the
01:21:04.199 fact of the matter is nobody is
01:21:07.199 irreplaceable and we have Tim Cook here
01:21:09.360 in the audience I believe who has proved
01:21:11.600 that and yeah has set an example for a
01:21:14.960 lot of people who
01:21:21.920 follow that's a great observation I now
01:21:26.000 having said that I will also add that
01:21:28.239 our board is conscious of the succession
01:21:31.120 issue not only at Warren's level but
01:21:32.840 also at my level and every year they
01:21:35.239 have me sitting in front of them
01:21:37.000 answering questions and having me share
01:21:39.840 my ideas with them in terms of what
01:21:42.520 would happen to the operations if I get
01:21:45.280 hit by a
01:21:46.199 truck
01:21:48.000 uh we go through the various operations
01:21:51.480 we have I review with them a short list
01:21:54.159 of people I think ought to be candidates
01:21:56.760 for replacing me and in addition to that
01:22:00.320 I go a step further and identify
01:22:02.600 particular individual as the person I
01:22:04.679 would hand over the keys to if something
01:22:06.600 were to happen to me obviously that
01:22:08.520 could subject to change but we take this
01:22:10.440 issue fairly seriously and I think at
01:22:12.960 the end of the day as as Tim Cook has
01:22:16.560 proved to us it'll be the biggest
01:22:18.239 nonissue of The Day the Earth will keep
01:22:20.440 still keep revolving around the axis
01:22:25.320 okay yeah we know what we we what we
01:22:29.120 know what we will will do we know it's a
01:22:32.800 good answer but we know it isn't it
01:22:35.440 isn't we won't have another
01:22:37.719 AG uh station
01:22:44.159 five hi my name is and Andrew ncas and
01:22:48.520 I'm wondering if you had one more day
01:22:50.920 with Charlie what would you do with him
01:22:55.110 [Applause]
01:23:03.840 well it's kind of interesting because in
01:23:06.760 effect I did have one more day I mean it
01:23:08.600 wasn't a full day or anything but uh but
01:23:11.639 he uh
01:23:13.880 uh
01:23:16.639 we we
01:23:19.120 always uh
01:23:22.280 lived uh in a way where we were happy
01:23:26.960 with what we were doing every day I mean
01:23:29.480 Charlie Charlie
01:23:31.840 liked
01:23:33.800 learning he liked as I mentioned in the
01:23:37.639 movie he liked a wide variety of things
01:23:41.600 so he was much broader than I was but I
01:23:45.360 didn't have any great desire to be as
01:23:47.000 broad as he was and he didn't have any
01:23:48.679 great desire to be as as narrow as but
01:23:52.360 we had a lot of fun doing anything and
01:23:56.239 um you know we played golf together we
01:23:58.280 played tennis together we we did
01:24:00.280 everything together and and uh and this
01:24:04.400 you may find kind of interesting we we
01:24:06.320 had as much fun perhaps even more to
01:24:09.320 some
01:24:10.080 extent with things that failed because
01:24:14.400 then we really had to work and work our
01:24:17.120 way out of them and and in a sense
01:24:20.800 there's more there's more fun having
01:24:23.920 having somebody that's uh your partner
01:24:27.040 in in digging your way out of a fo
01:24:29.760 Foxhole when there is just sitting there
01:24:31.600 and and watching an idea that you got 10
01:24:35.480 years ago just continually produce more
01:24:37.480 and more profit so it it it wasn't
01:24:41.520 uh you know he really he really fooled
01:24:45.320 me though on he went to to 99.9 years I
01:24:49.600 mean it if You' pick two guys you know
01:24:53.880 he never he he publicly said he never
01:24:56.480 did it a day of exercise except where it
01:24:59.800 was required when he was in the Army he
01:25:02.000 never did a day of voluntary exercise he
01:25:04.880 never thought about what he
01:25:06.600 ate uh you know it it it uh uh you know
01:25:14.880 we started every day and Charlie had he
01:25:18.159 was interested in more things than I was
01:25:20.920 but uh we never had any
01:25:25.639 doubts about the other person period and
01:25:30.040 uh uh so if I had another day with them
01:25:33.199 we'd probably done the same thing we
01:25:34.560 were doing the earlier days but we and
01:25:37.719 we wouldn't have wanted to know that we
01:25:39.080 only had one
01:25:40.320 day that there's a great advantage in in
01:25:43.920 uh not
01:25:45.360 knowing where you're going to what what
01:25:47.719 day you're going to die that uh uh and
01:25:51.560 Charlie always said you know that uh
01:25:53.880 just me where I'm going to die so I'll
01:25:56.840 never go there
01:25:58.920 well
01:26:00.520 uh uh it uh the truth is you know he
01:26:07.040 went everywhere with his mind and
01:26:10.760 uh and therefore he was not only
01:26:14.679 interested in the world at 99 but the
01:26:18.800 world was interested in him it's it's
01:26:21.840 remarkable uh you know they
01:26:25.880 he he I would I I told him toward in the
01:26:31.239 last few years I never seen anybody that
01:26:35.880 was peing you know in 99 and
01:26:40.880 and and and uh where the world wanted to
01:26:46.080 come and see him I mean they actually
01:26:48.360 wanted to go out to 351 North June
01:26:51.119 Street and whether it was what well I
01:26:54.440 could name a whole bunch of names but
01:26:55.920 just I'll start with Elon musker but
01:26:58.320 good on the list and they all wanted to
01:27:00.679 meet Charlie and Charlie was
01:27:02.920 happy to talk with them and I the only
01:27:07.360 the only uh uh person I could think of
01:27:11.400 otherwise was the dolly Lama I don't
01:27:14.239 know that they had a lot else in
01:27:17.960 common but but uh it was he he he lived
01:27:24.679 his life the way he wanted to and uh he
01:27:28.920 got to say what he wanted to
01:27:30.960 say he like I loved having a Podium and
01:27:38.320 and again I can't remember any time that
01:27:42.440 he was mad at me or I was mad at him it
01:27:44.199 just didn't happen uh uh and calling him
01:27:50.159 was fun back when longdistance rates
01:27:53.679 were and and the
01:27:56.800 and we didn't talk as often as the years
01:28:01.719 in recent years is we used to be on
01:28:04.719 daily uh for long
01:28:07.360 periods and and we did keep learning and
01:28:11.040 we like learning together but uh uh you
01:28:15.960 know
01:28:17.320 when
01:28:19.080 it we tended to be a little smarter
01:28:22.159 because when as the years went by cuz we
01:28:25.159 had mistakes and we had other things
01:28:26.920 that where we learned something and and
01:28:30.400 the fact that he and I were on the same
01:28:33.159 wavelength in that respect meant that uh
01:28:36.239 that the world was still a very
01:28:37.760 interesting place to us when he got to
01:28:40.199 be 99 and I got to be 93 so I don't have
01:28:43.679 a perfect answer for you there but I can
01:28:45.600 tell you the ingredients that would
01:28:48.760 going to
01:28:50.480 uh uh sometimes people would say to me
01:28:53.719 or at one of these meetings you know if
01:28:55.639 you could
01:28:56.639 only have lunch with one person that uh
01:29:01.119 lived over the last 2,000 or so years
01:29:03.480 you know who would you want to have it
01:29:04.880 with Charlie says I've already met all
01:29:07.360 of them you know because he he he read
01:29:09.560 all the books I mean he he he and he
01:29:12.360 eliminated all the trouble of going to
01:29:14.040 restaurants to meet him or anything like
01:29:15.440 that he just went through a book and he
01:29:17.360 met Ben Frankin and he he really uh he
01:29:22.400 was remarkable he but uh he said he
01:29:25.000 really had no one else to meet because
01:29:26.840 he he'd read all their stuff and he
01:29:29.159 liked Ben Franklin's stuff better than
01:29:30.639 he liked mine but but uh but with Ben
01:29:33.920 Franklin he just had to read about it
01:29:35.719 didn't have to they didn't have to go
01:29:38.040 have lunch with them or anything of the
01:29:39.400 sort uh but it's an interesting question
01:29:42.600 what you should probably ask yourself is
01:29:45.040 that who do you
01:29:47.080 feel that uh you'd want to start
01:29:51.400 spending the last day of your life with
01:29:54.159 and uh and then figure out a way to
01:29:58.000 start meeting him or tomorrow and uh and
01:30:03.239 meet them as often as you can that's why
01:30:06.159 wait a little the last day at uh and
01:30:10.159 don't bother with the
01:30:17.400 others okay
01:30:19.280 Becky uh this question comes from Carol
01:30:21.920 deand and Switzerland uh in Europe and
01:30:25.639 this is for both Mr Buffett and Mr Jane
01:30:29.520 as political instability in the world is
01:30:31.320 growing with a rise in the number of
01:30:33.280 armed conflicts and trade tension there
01:30:35.280 is also increasing risk of cyber attacks
01:30:38.520 what are your views on cyber security
01:30:40.560 Insurance asking this question in
01:30:43.000 general for retail small businesses and
01:30:45.440 large companies including critical key
01:30:47.639 infrastructure such as power plants
01:30:49.679 Harbors airports nuclear plants Etc do
01:30:53.199 you see potential for profit making in
01:30:55.520 cyber security insurance is and what are
01:30:57.199 the key
01:30:59.760 challenges uh okay let me start cyber
01:31:03.719 secure cyber insurance is become a very
01:31:06.119 fashionable product these days uh over
01:31:10.520 these last few years it is at least a
01:31:12.560 $10 billion market right now globally
01:31:16.119 and profitability is also being fairly
01:31:18.520 High I think profitability is at least
01:31:21.080 20% of the total premium uh has ended up
01:31:24.520 as profit in in the pockets of the
01:31:27.719 insurance be bearers now having said
01:31:31.080 that we at Burkshire tend to be very
01:31:34.040 very careful when it comes to taking on
01:31:36.719 Cyber Insurance
01:31:38.760 liabilities um for the part of actually
01:31:42.520 for two reasons one is it's very
01:31:44.960 difficult to know what is
01:31:47.880 the Quantum of losses that can be
01:31:50.800 subject to a sing Single occurrence and
01:31:53.360 the aggreg ation potential of cyber
01:31:56.119 losses especially if
01:31:58.719 some Cloud operation comes to a
01:32:01.239 standstill you know that aggregation
01:32:03.360 potential can be huge and not being able
01:32:06.080 to have a worst case gap on it is what
01:32:09.600 scares
01:32:10.679 us secondly it's also very difficult to
01:32:14.280 have some sense of what the what we call
01:32:17.320 loss cost of the cost of good sold could
01:32:19.719 potentially be it's not just for a
01:32:21.920 single loss but for losses across over
01:32:24.480 time they have been fairly well
01:32:26.880 contained out of 100 cents of the dollar
01:32:29.920 of the premium losses over the last four
01:32:32.239 or five years I think have not been
01:32:34.239 beyond 40 cents on the dollar leaving a
01:32:36.400 decent profit margin but having said
01:32:38.600 that there's not enough data to be able
01:32:40.679 to hang your hat on and say what your
01:32:43.840 true loss cost is so in our insurance
01:32:47.080 operations I have told the people
01:32:48.480 running the operations is I've
01:32:51.000 discouraged them from writing cyber
01:32:52.840 insurance to the extent they need to
01:32:55.440 write it so as to satisfy certain client
01:32:57.880 needs I have told them no matter how
01:32:59.960 much you charge you should tell yourself
01:33:02.000 that each time you write a cyber
01:33:03.440 insurance policy you're losing money we
01:33:06.199 can argue about how much money you're
01:33:07.360 losing but the mindset should be you're
01:33:09.159 not making money on it you're losing
01:33:10.679 money and then we should go from there
01:33:13.520 so it is it's projected to be a huge
01:33:17.119 business my guess is at some point it
01:33:19.080 might become a huge business but it
01:33:21.000 might be associated with huge losses and
01:33:23.320 our is to sort of stay away from it
01:33:26.000 right now until we can have access to
01:33:28.679 some meaningful data and hang a hat on
01:33:31.600 data well you've just made you've just
01:33:34.800 heard why aeta is invaluable
01:33:38.119 because that
01:33:41.159 uh
01:33:42.840 uh when you insure something you really
01:33:46.480 want to think of what how much can you
01:33:49.000 lose and the
01:33:52.360 question I remember the first time it
01:33:54.440 was happened I think in the 1968 when
01:33:57.040 there were the riots in various
01:33:59.960 cities because I think Bob I think it
01:34:03.199 was the Bobby Kennedy death that set it
01:34:04.920 off for the Martin Luther King death I'm
01:34:07.080 not sure which one but in any event when
01:34:10.480 you write a
01:34:12.360 policy you have a limit in that
01:34:15.280 policy but the question is is what is
01:34:19.800 one
01:34:20.639 event so if if uh uh if
01:34:26.119 somebody is assassinated in some town
01:34:30.000 and that causes losses of thousands of
01:34:33.480 businesses all over the country if
01:34:36.040 you've written all those thousands of
01:34:37.920 policies you have one event or do you
01:34:41.719 have a thousand
01:34:43.320 events and there's no place where that
01:34:48.040 kind of a dilemma enters into more than
01:34:51.840 cyber because if you think about it if
01:34:55.719 uh you know let's say you're
01:34:58.520 writing $10 million of limit per per
01:35:02.480 risk and decide that's fine and you're
01:35:04.960 if you lose 10 million you know for some
01:35:07.719 event you can take it but the problem is
01:35:10.480 if that one event turns out to affect a
01:35:15.600 thousand policies and somehow they're
01:35:17.440 all linked together in some
01:35:21.080 way uh and the course decide that way uh
01:35:27.320 you've written something
01:35:29.440 that in no way we're getting the proper
01:35:31.960 price for and and could break the
01:35:34.920 company and I will tell you that most
01:35:37.840 people want to be in anything that's
01:35:39.440 fashionable when they write insurance
01:35:41.320 and cyber's an easy issue you can write
01:35:43.840 a lot of it and uh the agents like it
01:35:47.199 you know they're getting the commission
01:35:48.239 on every policy they write and you've
01:35:51.960 got to have somebody in charge of things
01:35:54.239 that understands that you may get an
01:35:56.679 aggregation of risk that you never
01:35:58.639 dreamt of and may be worse than some
01:36:00.800 earthquake happening someplace just
01:36:02.679 because you have a whole bunch of
01:36:04.679 policies with a million dollar limit and
01:36:07.600 I would say that uh human nature is such
01:36:11.400 that that most insurance companies will
01:36:15.600 get very excited and their agents will
01:36:17.600 get very excited and it's very
01:36:19.199 fashionable and it's kind of
01:36:20.880 interesting and uh as char would say it
01:36:24.159 may be R
01:36:27.760 poison okay well that's cheerful here
01:36:29.960 we'll go to station
01:36:36.000 six good morning this question is for
01:36:39.800 waren buffet and great able my name is
01:36:44.080 Maria PES I am a retire from Las Vegas
01:36:48.320 Nevada I am here today as a member of
01:36:51.560 chispa Nevada a group developed Latin
01:36:55.639 leaders for the environment of justices
01:36:59.719 I am Al I am almost here representing
01:37:04.480 Mary Latin families in Nevada who are
01:37:08.280 struggling to pay their utility bills
01:37:12.239 and one access to Affordable clean
01:37:16.560 electricity I want to add today why is
01:37:21.199 NB energy with which is owned by the
01:37:25.600 burshire haway building new gas plants
01:37:31.159 instead of investing in solar energy
01:37:36.440 with Nevada one and this sunniest state
01:37:41.000 in the
01:37:42.360 country can I expect to see future
01:37:47.440 leadership take dangerous investments in
01:37:51.480 the fossils l
01:37:54.400 more
01:37:56.320 seriously thank you and thank you Maria
01:38:00.400 uh Greg you want sure um thank you so as
01:38:05.719 we touched on with Envy energy even
01:38:08.360 earlier there's um a lot going on there
01:38:11.400 and I when I think of uh there's no
01:38:13.960 question solar is a a great opportunity
01:38:16.719 for Envy energy and we'll continue
01:38:19.880 to um utilize that as a resource and
01:38:23.639 continue to invest in it uh in that
01:38:26.679 utility and and the other utility we
01:38:29.400 have in Nevada we're also in a point
01:38:32.840 where when you think of a transition
01:38:34.719 that's going on within the energy sector
01:38:37.719 we are transitioning from carbon
01:38:39.840 resources to renewable resources as was
01:38:43.080 noted but it it it will not occur
01:38:46.639 overnight that transition will take many
01:38:49.280 years and as we use be it renewable res
01:38:53.440 resources such as solar or wind they are
01:38:56.840 in intermittent and we do try to combine
01:38:59.880 it with batteries but it do at this
01:39:03.520 point in time we cannot transition
01:39:06.920 completely away from the carbon
01:39:08.920 resources so if I think of Nevada in the
01:39:12.000 in the next two years our last two coal
01:39:15.440 units are well actually in the next year
01:39:18.239 our last two coal units will retire but
01:39:21.159 we are replacing them with uh a new gas
01:39:24.360 unit which is is truly needed to make
01:39:26.599 sure that system remains uh reliable and
01:39:30.000 available to our to our customers and
01:39:32.520 that's and that's done in conjunction
01:39:34.719 with our with the state um
01:39:37.560 representatives and our regulator
01:39:40.280 agencies to make sure we can serve those
01:39:42.239 customers every day and every minute we
01:39:45.400 have great examples in Iowa where at
01:39:47.520 times 100% of our energy comes from wind
01:39:51.960 and we're and we're thrilled with that
01:39:53.480 that and I believe we hit that for
01:39:56.520 example on Earth Day uh every we had
01:39:59.760 enough wind that we could meet the
01:40:01.520 demand of that state but the next day if
01:40:04.400 the wind's not blowing we need our gas
01:40:06.920 resources our gas plants to to fill that
01:40:10.040 Gap and really that's the situation we
01:40:12.679 still have in in Nevada so we'll
01:40:15.480 continue the transition to renewable
01:40:18.040 resources be It Solar in Nevada and wind
01:40:21.280 and other areas combined with battery
01:40:24.080 but for the foreseeable future we do see
01:40:26.679 gas being a very important resource to
01:40:28.960 help maintain reliability and meet meet
01:40:32.000 our customer customer needs and and to
01:40:34.480 meet it in an affordable way is also an
01:40:37.840 important uh piece of that so thank you
01:40:40.560 for your comments all right yeah
01:40:46.520 we in in a we we've got the capital to
01:40:49.679 do whatever makes the most sense in a
01:40:52.520 place like Nevada and the Nebraska the
01:40:56.239 Nevada I don't know each each state
01:40:59.360 calls their ruling commission something
01:41:01.480 different but they probably call the
01:41:02.639 Public Service Commission or something
01:41:04.080 like and they they're making the
01:41:06.239 decision as to what they
01:41:11.119 think can and should be done uh in terms
01:41:15.520 of getting from
01:41:18.239 where a vastly
01:41:20.880 complicated utility business
01:41:24.000 moves towards something different
01:41:26.000 without messing things up in the
01:41:27.840 meantime and and uh you know having the
01:41:31.000 lights go off and they they I think they
01:41:34.520 would probably agree with you very much
01:41:36.360 Maria that they what they where they
01:41:39.040 want to get but they can't they can't do
01:41:42.639 it tomorrow you know you know because
01:41:45.239 the inter intermittent problems and uh
01:41:48.639 their job is to make sure the lights
01:41:50.239 stay on and their job is also to move
01:41:53.760 uh toward better
01:41:56.800 sources um but solar will never be the
01:42:02.320 only source of uh of electricity because
01:42:07.480 it uh uh well Greg may know more about
01:42:11.560 this but I'm barring some real
01:42:13.960 breakthroughs and storage and that sort
01:42:15.760 of thing right yeah yeah generally a
01:42:18.119 battery right now to do it in a
01:42:20.159 economical way is is a 4-Hour battery
01:42:23.679 and and when you think of the time
01:42:25.560 without um the the sun being available
01:42:28.560 that's a that's a b that's a challenge
01:42:30.480 now there there's a lot of technology
01:42:32.760 advancements and that's stretching out
01:42:34.560 and you throw dollars at a lot of things
01:42:36.800 you can accomplish things but the
01:42:38.800 reality is that's there's a there's a
01:42:40.960 careful balance of of the reliability
01:42:43.679 and also balancing as you as it was
01:42:46.679 noted the rates do matter and and how
01:42:49.320 much customers are paying so delicate
01:42:51.840 balance of both delivering reliability
01:42:54.040 but doing it in an affordable way yeah
01:42:57.599 my friend Bill Gates he's working on
01:43:01.320 shortening up that or lengthening the
01:43:03.480 time the battery works on and so you got
01:43:05.320 some very smart people working out but
01:43:07.360 it isn't something that you actually do
01:43:09.159 overnight and and uh I can understand
01:43:11.639 why people want it that overnight but it
01:43:13.960 it is going to take a lot of money it's
01:43:16.679 going to take a lot of good ideas and
01:43:18.679 smart people like Bill and Greg not me I
01:43:22.719 don't I don't understand why the damnn
01:43:24.280 lights go on when I even turn the switch
01:43:26.480 but those those Fells really do know and
01:43:28.639 there's plenty of them working on it and
01:43:30.199 we got plenty of money to implement it
01:43:33.480 but there
01:43:34.719 are there are certain things that
01:43:38.119 uh that just take a certain amount of
01:43:42.599 uh time my daughter hates it when I use
01:43:46.119 this example but uh it's really true
01:43:49.920 that you can't create a baby uh in one
01:43:53.280 month by getting nine women pregnant I
01:43:55.320 mean that you know you may want you may
01:43:59.400 want a baby but so there are certain
01:44:02.800 laws of nature that you have to work
01:44:05.679 with Okay
01:44:08.400 Becky uh this question comes from Rich
01:44:11.199 McClosky in dun Eden Florida he says
01:44:14.800 Warren and a would you let us know what
01:44:17.159 you think about the car and property
01:44:19.080 insurance situation in Florida as a
01:44:21.440 resident both seem out of control
01:44:23.080 control since the Florida Market seems
01:44:25.320 to be so mismanaged is this an
01:44:27.320 opportunity for
01:44:30.599 Berkshire yeah the Florida Market both
01:44:33.560 for auto insurance and for homeowners
01:44:35.760 insurance has had a few tough years uh
01:44:39.520 the two problems we face in Florida and
01:44:41.639 all the risk bearers face in Florida one
01:44:44.280 is the lawyers and the amount of
01:44:46.159 corruption that takes place in the
01:44:48.199 Florida Market is keep skyrocketing
01:44:51.480 making it difficult for us to price
01:44:53.360 price the product and make a profit and
01:44:55.960 secondly the amount of activity in terms
01:44:58.360 of storms both the frequency and the
01:45:01.679 severity is also so severe
01:45:05.119 that the losses in Florida tend to make
01:45:08.280 it very difficult for a risk Bearer to
01:45:10.040 make money having said that we've had a
01:45:12.960 we' fortunately had a very good run at
01:45:14.599 Florida last year we increased our
01:45:17.000 exposure in Florida as we talked about
01:45:18.760 last year and fortunately nothing bad
01:45:20.960 happened so a lot of our premiums that
01:45:23.400 were in the Top Line flew straight to
01:45:24.840 the bottom line Florida is a large
01:45:27.960 Market Florida is a market that's
01:45:31.080 subsidized by the rest of the country I
01:45:33.560 don't think
01:45:35.639 those that's going to stand the test of
01:45:38.280 time the Florida Market the legislators
01:45:40.880 are trying to improve it they have
01:45:42.920 passed law that is bringing down the
01:45:45.599 amount of fraud that takes place in
01:45:47.199 Florida and I hope Florida will be a
01:45:49.679 fairly buoyant Insurance Market because
01:45:51.840 at the end of the day they do believe in
01:45:54.520 the free market more than some of the
01:45:56.119 other states that have insurance crisis
01:45:58.560 like California and New York so yes
01:46:01.920 Florida has a problem prices will go up
01:46:05.119 fairly substantially but at the end of
01:46:07.000 the day I think we'll achieve a degree
01:46:09.239 of balance so that the risk bearers can
01:46:12.280 make a decent profit and will be
01:46:14.199 deploying Capital out
01:46:16.599 there okay station seven please
01:46:25.119 hi Warren um my name is Christine h
01:46:28.040 Garcia and I'm from aora Hills
01:46:30.679 California thank you for being an
01:46:32.760 excellent teacher and imparting your
01:46:34.840 wisdom to us throughout the
01:46:37.880 years what advice would you like to
01:46:41.040 share today that you believe everyone
01:46:44.599 needs to
01:46:50.159 hear well too bad you didn't that he
01:46:53.000 added that what what the rest of us
01:46:55.520 would like to
01:46:56.880 hear
01:46:58.400 the uh no
01:47:01.599 they oh I would say that if if I had one
01:47:05.400 piece of advice I would try
01:47:09.719 to well and you're lucky you live in
01:47:12.000 this country because it just to start
01:47:13.920 with because you've got opportunities
01:47:15.599 here that wouldn't exist in much of the
01:47:18.599 world uh
01:47:24.840 but I would like I I would like
01:47:27.840 the really sort of use Charlie's advice
01:47:31.360 of the thinking how you like
01:47:35.040 your obituary to read and then uh uh
01:47:41.360 start selecting the educational pass the
01:47:44.800 Social pass you know
01:47:47.920 whatever May that your P particular
01:47:52.080 situation in terms of
01:47:54.400 associating and
01:47:56.320 perhaps uh certainly in my day I would
01:47:58.760 have been marrying the person that
01:48:01.560 would best help you do that well Charlie
01:48:06.719 would say you are offering some similar
01:48:10.560 benefit to the
01:48:12.520 partner and uh uh you know the the
01:48:17.880 opportunity in this country is you know
01:48:20.159 just basically Limitless that uh
01:48:23.360 when you think of going back not that
01:48:26.639 many centuries you know if you were
01:48:29.080 going to be a Shepherd or something like
01:48:30.599 that you 100 years from now you're
01:48:32.080 you're you know your your grandson was a
01:48:35.440 grand daughter was going to be a
01:48:37.119 Shepherd I mean nothing nothing really
01:48:39.119 happened and what has happened in the
01:48:42.159 last 200 years with the combination of
01:48:45.480 the Industrial Revolution and but
01:48:48.199 whether it's science or education or
01:48:50.320 health or you you name it we are so
01:48:53.800 lucky to be
01:48:55.840 born uh when we were the people in this
01:48:58.800 room and and many of us we're lucky
01:49:02.080 enough to be born in United States as
01:49:04.440 well uh that uh you know
01:49:10.199 you you've had the you're entering the
01:49:12.920 best world that's ever
01:49:15.920 existed and you want to find the people
01:49:19.599 to share it with and the activities to
01:49:22.040 participate in
01:49:23.280 in uh that fit you and if you get
01:49:28.360 lucky uh like Charlie and I did you find
01:49:32.760 things that interest you young but if
01:49:35.280 you don't find them right away you keep
01:49:36.960 looking and uh uh I always tell students
01:49:43.239 that take the job that you I mean find
01:49:47.080 the job that you want would like to have
01:49:49.000 if you didn't need a job and sometimes
01:49:52.360 you could find that very early and
01:49:54.320 sometimes sometimes you go through
01:49:56.440 various experiences but don't forget
01:49:58.239 what you're trying actually are trying
01:49:59.880 to do and there's no place to do it like
01:50:02.360 this country and find the person that
01:50:04.199 you like to share your life with uh in
01:50:06.719 many cases and and and you know
01:50:09.520 sometimes you get lucky and do that
01:50:11.000 early and uh and sometimes you make
01:50:14.760 mistakes and uh
01:50:18.920 but uh I would
01:50:23.040 I would try to in a very very general
01:50:26.159 way I would try to figure out how you'd
01:50:29.080 want to look back on your life and think
01:50:31.599 about yourself and and uh and start the
01:50:35.679 day to go on the path that leads to to
01:50:38.920 that goal and expect expect some some uh
01:50:43.719 difficulties along the way but if you're
01:50:47.000 if you're thinking that way you you're
01:50:48.560 more likely to get there
01:50:57.599 Becky uh this question comes from as
01:51:00.639 Axel mayor seek in hurg
01:51:04.159 Germany um what has changed for
01:51:06.440 berkshire's operating CEOs since Greg
01:51:08.800 AEL and AET Jane became vice chairman
01:51:11.719 for example can and do the operating
01:51:14.199 CEOs still reach out to Warren Buffett
01:51:20.440 directly well let's
01:51:24.480 uh might the answer might surprise you
01:51:26.840 but they they
01:51:30.000 overwhelmingly uh the operating
01:51:34.040 Executives uh well they they prefer to
01:51:38.599 talk to to Gregor to to a Jeep and uh
01:51:46.119 that didn't that's understandable
01:51:48.920 because uh I don't really do much and I
01:51:52.599 don't operate at the same level of
01:51:54.320 efficiency that I would have 30 years
01:51:56.480 ago or 40 years ago I don't know the
01:51:58.440 managers as well as I would have when we
01:52:00.400 were smaller and when I could get more
01:52:03.400 accomplished in the day than I can now
01:52:06.840 and you've got when You' got somebody
01:52:09.280 like Greg and a Jeet uh you know why
01:52:13.040 subtle for me I basically so it's it's
01:52:17.000 it's worked out extremely
01:52:20.480 well uh
01:52:23.199 uh
01:52:24.400 and
01:52:26.520 uh I I almost can't imagine anything
01:52:29.599 working better because uh
01:52:33.400 Greg in the year
01:52:36.159 accomplishes I mean he sees more of them
01:52:39.760 understands more about their problems
01:52:42.079 you know can give them suggestions he's
01:52:44.320 got incredible amounts of energy and
01:52:49.560 and
01:52:51.119 uh no body has more wisdom than the Jeep
01:52:54.920 about insurance and uh they've got
01:52:58.360 access in the insurance to now they had
01:53:03.119 it before we stuck some of those titles
01:53:05.199 on in Insurance whereas with Greg he
01:53:08.880 much expanded things when when when he
01:53:12.079 became uh the vice chairman in charge of
01:53:15.800 of really everything except insurance
01:53:18.719 so he
01:53:21.079 is if you told our
01:53:24.040 managers uh that fall under his
01:53:27.560 jurisdiction which would be a lot of
01:53:29.960 them uh uh
01:53:34.280 they they
01:53:36.440 would much preferred
01:53:39.320 unless like a few they weren't paying as
01:53:42.760 much attention to their business and I
01:53:44.360 wouldn't do anything about it but but
01:53:46.719 Greg would and uh and they still like it
01:53:49.560 when he does it he can deliver he can he
01:53:52.639 can deliver news very well to to people
01:53:56.560 who uh you know there's some there'll be
01:54:00.000 some people if you have if you have 20
01:54:02.920 children and you're very rich you'll
01:54:05.119 have some that will be go-getters anyway
01:54:07.639 and you'll have some that that uh won't
01:54:11.159 and uh we are a very very rich company
01:54:15.679 and uh we
01:54:18.159 don't
01:54:19.960 uh we we haven't had a history
01:54:23.400 of being very tough on on people that uh
01:54:27.800 coasted and we've had some that would do
01:54:31.400 that and Greg will do something about it
01:54:34.079 and Charlie and I wouldn't have uh not
01:54:36.639 because we didn't know it should be done
01:54:38.159 but because we were doing so well
01:54:39.639 ourselves and everything it just wasn't
01:54:42.520 it we didn't we wouldn't make the effort
01:54:45.040 we didn't want to change our lives that
01:54:46.520 way plus we slowed down in various ways
01:54:48.599 physically and everything so so I would
01:54:51.639 I would uh
01:54:53.040 I would say that
01:54:54.800 uh the number
01:54:57.239 of calls I
01:54:59.679 get for managers is is essentially
01:55:03.360 awfully close to zero and Greg is
01:55:07.840 handling those you know I don't I don't
01:55:11.199 know quite how he does it but but uh but
01:55:15.760 uh we've got the right person I can tell
01:55:18.320 you that and with the G he he he does
01:55:23.040 less physical moving and and the
01:55:25.320 insurance people are more used to
01:55:27.199 working with the Jeep obviously over the
01:55:30.040 years so uh I wouldn't say
01:55:34.800 that changing the title would be changed
01:55:38.360 as much there because he was in charge
01:55:40.560 of insurance anyway and uh so that's uh
01:55:45.360 you know you can you can go to a
01:55:47.760 business school and and they can give
01:55:50.679 you way better answers um I've just
01:55:53.280 given you but but that's the way we do
01:55:55.280 it at Berkshire she raised his hand yeah
01:55:59.440 uh if I can add a comment from my
01:56:01.920 perspective the transition has worked
01:56:03.480 out very very well but I think the
01:56:07.280 credit really goes to how Warren has
01:56:09.079 handled the situation and what I mean by
01:56:11.719 that is after the transation was
01:56:14.199 announced and a lot of the operating
01:56:16.280 managers used to be they were used to
01:56:19.199 calling Warren directly on some issue or
01:56:21.159 the other when they after the transation
01:56:24.360 when they would continue to do so Warren
01:56:27.280 would very skillfully in his in his
01:56:29.760 manner handle them such that he would
01:56:33.119 not answer what they were looking for
01:56:35.639 but at the same time made them feel good
01:56:38.440 and told them that he sort of enjoyed
01:56:40.480 hearing from them and talking to them so
01:56:43.079 as a result of which you know the
01:56:44.360 transation took place people got the
01:56:46.560 message they got the message and were
01:56:49.520 very responsive to it and it's a
01:56:51.679 non-issue as far as today's
01:56:54.239 concern I'd probably add yeah
01:56:58.719 a the only thing I would add is we do
01:57:01.360 have an exceptional set of managers
01:57:03.760 across both the um uh non-insurance and
01:57:07.520 insurance and yes waren made it
01:57:09.639 incredibly easy but so did they it it
01:57:11.920 was a very easy transition because they
01:57:15.159 cared deeply about Burkshire they care
01:57:17.000 deeply about the culture and they very
01:57:19.119 much wanted it to be a a success and
01:57:22.480 we're fortunate to have uh those
01:57:24.960 managers in insurance and non-insurance
01:57:27.239 so thank you yeah what what Greg is
01:57:30.320 talking about is they really wanted more
01:57:32.719 Direction in in some cases than than I
01:57:36.040 gave them you know I mean it uh I just
01:57:39.119 sat there reading the Wall Street
01:57:40.440 Journal or whatever and uh uh Greg is I
01:57:46.079 don't you
01:57:48.040 know there one way or another there are
01:57:50.719 more than 24 hours in his day you know
01:57:53.360 and uh I I I just don't know how he
01:57:55.520 covers the ground he does but but he
01:57:57.880 knows more about the people
01:58:02.520 uh
01:58:04.199 he we got the same feeling in terms of
01:58:07.679 judging the attractiveness of businesses
01:58:09.760 and making Capital decisions and that
01:58:11.480 sort of thing but but he's willing to
01:58:14.679 work I mean I you know I I I uh you know
01:58:19.159 and I couldn't get as much done anyway
01:58:21.719 you know what I could do in in couple of
01:58:25.719 hours you know may take it hours now it
01:58:28.599 it it I just don't read as fast and
01:58:30.920 different things said but uh it it's
01:58:34.840 working very well and and uh uh this
01:58:39.920 place if anything happened to me it
01:58:43.079 would be
01:58:44.040 working extremely well the next day I
01:58:47.159 don't get any phone calls you could you
01:58:49.119 can actually we can we can rig something
01:58:50.880 up so we got some answering machine that
01:58:52.599 people think I'm still around you know
01:58:54.079 or something in
01:58:56.719 terms so anyway that's that's uh much
01:59:02.320 much less than you'd learn in business
01:59:04.079 school but that's the way we do it at
01:59:05.719 Berkshire okay station
01:59:10.840 eight dear Warren Greg and Ajit thank
01:59:14.800 you for having us your teachings have
01:59:17.920 not only made us better investors but
01:59:20.560 more importantly better people thank you
01:59:23.000 for that my name is Rajiv Agarwal and I
01:59:26.360 am from New Jersey I run an India Focus
01:59:29.639 fund called duari India fund my question
01:59:33.079 is related to India Indian economy and
01:59:36.880 Indian equities have done quite well in
01:59:39.639 the last 5 10 20 years it is the fifth
01:59:43.599 largest economy and will be the third
01:59:45.560 largest in the next few
01:59:47.719 years my question is is birkshire
01:59:51.480 actively looking for opportunities in
01:59:54.360 the Indian Equity market and what will
01:59:56.960 allow you to buy anything meaningful
01:59:59.760 there thank you yeah well that's a very
02:00:02.360 good question and obviously India you
02:00:05.679 know
02:00:07.840 it's I'm sure there are loads of
02:00:10.560 opportunities in a place like India and
02:00:15.280 uh the question is do we have any
02:00:18.040 advantage in either insights into those
02:00:21.320 businesses or contexts that will make
02:00:24.360 possible
02:00:25.480 some some
02:00:28.520 transaction that uh might what the
02:00:32.880 parties in India would particularly want
02:00:35.719 us to participate uh uh I would say that
02:00:41.239 that's something that a more
02:00:45.079 energetic management at at at
02:00:48.880 Berkshire could pursue uh because we do
02:00:53.159 have the reputation now Berkshire is
02:00:56.159 known not like it's known in the United
02:00:58.440 States but it's known around the world
02:01:00.360 and and uh you know our Japanese
02:01:03.480 experience has been fascinating in that
02:01:05.920 respect uh uh so there may be an
02:01:11.400 unexplored or uh unattended to
02:01:16.599 opportunity in that area I'm not the one
02:01:18.840 to do it um but that may be something
02:01:22.159 that uh uh in the
02:01:26.079 future
02:01:28.239 uh it might be opportunities there there
02:01:31.800 there there are opportunities the
02:01:33.599 question is is is does Berkshire have
02:01:37.360 some kind of advantage in actually
02:01:40.199 pursuing those opportunities against
02:01:43.199 particularly against people that are
02:01:45.239 using other people's money that that
02:01:48.280 where they get paid based on
02:01:50.679 asset uh on assets managed or something
02:01:54.199 of sort I mean there there are plenty of
02:01:57.079 people in the game who are buying and
02:02:00.920 running businesses that uh uh do not
02:02:05.599 really have our philosophy I mean they
02:02:07.760 uh they uh uh they're going to get rich
02:02:12.040 no matter what happens and and uh
02:02:17.719 uh
02:02:19.360 the their payment may be based on on on
02:02:23.800 how much they buy rather than what they
02:02:26.280 buy uh so we'll see how the next
02:02:30.520 management plays the game out at at
02:02:33.719 burshire and fortunately you don't have
02:02:35.880 too long to wait on that generally I
02:02:38.360 feel fine but but but I I uh I know a
02:02:42.960 little bit about actuarials at tables
02:02:45.360 and uh uh uh I just um well I would say
02:02:51.480 this
02:02:52.840 I I shouldn't be taking on
02:02:56.239 any fouryear employment contracts like
02:02:59.920 several people are doing in this world
02:03:02.760 in an age where you can't be quite that
02:03:04.960 sure where you're going to be in four
02:03:08.079 years
02:03:12.119 okay but you're de you're absolutely
02:03:15.199 right about about you you have if you
02:03:19.280 were
02:03:20.360 energetic had some way
02:03:24.840 to uh
02:03:27.360 become
02:03:28.920 a
02:03:30.480 a buyer of
02:03:33.000 a uh or a a a a a party that people
02:03:38.520 particularly wanted to do business
02:03:42.599 with
02:03:44.520 uh Japan was
02:03:46.880 great and India could be great but India
02:03:51.000 and Japan AR AR the same I mean I don't
02:03:53.159 adapt myself terribly well to different
02:03:55.920 different
02:03:56.840 cultures uh and some people are really
02:03:59.320 good at it uh and almost anybody's
02:04:02.639 better than I am but I stumbled into one
02:04:05.639 or two but uh that could happen in the
02:04:09.639 in in in in you know act two of U
02:04:13.880 Berkshire out of the
02:04:16.320 way
02:04:18.320 Becky this is a question from Rafael
02:04:20.719 doino from
02:04:22.559 Spain Berkshire has grown tremendously
02:04:25.480 thanks to and among other things its
02:04:27.559 architect Mr Munger and you its general
02:04:30.400 contractor we're all tremendously
02:04:32.480 thankful to you for taking us along the
02:04:34.400 way we are aware that both of you and
02:04:36.880 many others have spent an enormous
02:04:38.520 amount of time uring berkshire's culture
02:04:40.639 provides a solid footing on which to
02:04:42.360 grow the building you also currently
02:04:44.679 have a very talented bench of what we
02:04:46.639 may label as subcontractors in Mr Abel
02:04:49.559 Mr Jane Mr Colmes and Mr West
02:04:52.880 however for a long time you've had the
02:04:54.440 advantage that talented subcontractors
02:04:57.079 have wanted to work with a once in a
02:04:58.639 generation architect and general
02:05:00.719 contractor how do you envision Berkshire
02:05:02.920 will overcome the loss of set Advantage
02:05:05.199 when the contractor bench needs to be
02:05:06.800 renewed again and what are what are
02:05:09.119 potential renovation Works in this great
02:05:11.239 building that may necessitate a new
02:05:14.199 architect yeah well that's a great
02:05:16.159 question which the Charlie and I
02:05:18.719 obviously talked a lot about over time
02:05:20.480 and of course
02:05:23.280 we uh we will not B sure to the extent
02:05:29.159 it
02:05:30.239 Remains the sort of entity that it is
02:05:33.679 will not need to attract people very
02:05:37.000 often uh it would be absolutely crazy
02:05:40.639 for anybody for our board of directors
02:05:44.199 to ever pick anybody to run this
02:05:47.159 business that thought you should retire
02:05:49.520 at
02:05:50.480 65 uh uh it may be that they should
02:05:53.480 retire the next day you know when you
02:05:55.360 learn what they really like managing
02:05:57.040 something or it may turn that you want
02:05:58.440 to keep them around they they really
02:06:01.040 start aect being affected by old age
02:06:03.360 which hits different people at different
02:06:05.239 times but it hits everybody
02:06:07.119 eventually and so we it's very
02:06:11.559 likely that if
02:06:14.800 it's if the directors and it's very
02:06:17.920 tough because they will be acting
02:06:20.520 against conventional wisdom which which
02:06:22.719 is always difficult and uh but I think
02:06:27.840 we've got the group on that and they
02:06:30.840 they will not have to make a decision
02:06:32.559 very often if they if they pick the
02:06:36.079 right uh CEO that's 99% of the job of
02:06:41.040 the directors and uh if they the
02:06:45.040 other 1% is is you do you have a good
02:06:50.239 method to correct it if youve made a
02:06:52.760 wrong decision and that's extremely hard
02:06:55.480 to do uh in in our present system it's
02:07:00.760 not impossible but uh uh it's just not
02:07:06.040 something that happens it's too good a
02:07:07.840 job to be a director to to to try and
02:07:11.040 throw over somebody at particularly if
02:07:13.239 you can use the money from
02:07:15.599 directorships and you
02:07:17.520 want to be on other boards and
02:07:19.840 everything we we we do not have a perect
02:07:21.840 system in in terms of boards of
02:07:24.119 directors at all and it's it doesn't
02:07:26.800 operate at all well I shouldn't say at
02:07:29.239 all but it doesn't it it it doesn't
02:07:33.079 operate as as people may think it
02:07:38.000 generally operates
02:07:40.960 so we
02:07:43.440 will you know we' really got the problem
02:07:46.719 solved for the next 20 years unless
02:07:49.159 something UNT happens and something unto
02:07:52.440 happens then then the
02:07:55.000 directors need to find probably within
02:07:58.559 our own
02:08:00.159 organization uh somebody that they've
02:08:03.199 got confidence in to
02:08:07.079 maintain the special advantages we have
02:08:11.199 uh over another 20 years period it's
02:08:14.360 there's various things that are low
02:08:16.880 probabilities but you still have to
02:08:18.400 think about them and uh and we are in
02:08:22.320 that position now now if you asked
02:08:25.679 me whether if something happened to Greg
02:08:30.559 today everybody says don't travel on the
02:08:33.400 same plane the thing to do is not travel
02:08:35.920 on the same Auto planes don't go down
02:08:39.000 that often Autos crash all the time I've
02:08:41.320 seen all these corporate policies on
02:08:43.440 that which are kind of crazy when you
02:08:45.520 think about the real risk but in any
02:08:48.360 event uh we do
02:08:52.679 Greg is going to have to tell the
02:08:55.000 directors
02:08:56.360 about what if something happened
02:08:58.599 tomorrow he has to tell the directors
02:09:00.119 about what should be done if anything
02:09:01.360 happens to him and uh that's not an easy
02:09:04.960 thing to do
02:09:07.239 and
02:09:09.040 uh uh I don't
02:09:12.880 have uh well it it will be his decision
02:09:18.360 and then the directors
02:09:19.920 really the decide whether he's made the
02:09:22.840 right one but he will he will make the
02:09:26.559 right
02:09:27.320 one uh and what you really have to hope
02:09:31.400 is that you get lucky on how long
02:09:36.360 managers stick around I mean you you
02:09:39.800 might need three in a century and you
02:09:42.000 might need six or
02:09:43.960 seven uh but uh
02:09:49.719 the the the answer is you need a little
02:09:53.320 luck and you need some break in the
02:09:54.920 mortality tables but we've we've got an
02:09:58.480 entity that if you really aspire to be a
02:10:01.280 certain kind of
02:10:02.719 manager of a really large entity there's
02:10:06.400 nothing like it in the world so uh we've
02:10:09.960 got something to
02:10:11.440 offer the person who we want to have you
02:10:15.280 know it's a sort of like Charlie said
02:10:17.239 about marrying the best person that will
02:10:18.800 have you well we we have uh
02:10:21.920 we've got something
02:10:23.480 that the right person would want to
02:10:25.679 marry you know basically in terms of
02:10:28.079 birkshire uh and if we get the wrong
02:10:30.760 person then the directors have to do
02:10:33.000 something about it and that probably
02:10:35.599 won't happen but it's always a
02:10:38.159 contingency a possibility I should
02:10:41.599 say Craig having been put on the spot
02:10:44.159 like that
02:10:45.119 didn't you don't have to name anybody
02:10:47.400 now but I'm sure the crowd would love it
02:10:49.360 make news
02:10:51.639 think I would add uh Warren is uh and
02:10:54.920 it's really how the comment started was
02:10:57.000 around culture um the culture we have at
02:11:00.360 Berkshire and that being our our
02:11:03.000 shareholders being our partners and our
02:11:05.880 managers of our business having that
02:11:07.960 ownership mentality that's never going
02:11:10.719 to change and that will attract the
02:11:13.719 right managers uh at every level so I
02:11:17.119 think as Warren said we have a very
02:11:19.400 special uh company Berkshire but it's
02:11:22.199 that culture that makes it special and
02:11:24.239 and that's not going to
02:11:27.320 change
02:11:33.119 okay station
02:11:36.960 nine I'm never sure where nine is hi I'm
02:11:40.960 Sherman lam a Booker shareholder and I
02:11:43.280 work for a family office in qualo
02:11:46.360 Malaysia just really happy to see you
02:11:48.559 Warren and the team and where I come
02:11:50.639 from you're hero and both you and
02:11:53.239 Charlie have positively transformed mine
02:11:56.880 and many many other Malaysians and
02:11:59.440 Southeast Asians lives not only
02:12:01.520 financially but also in how we navigate
02:12:03.520 our lives and relationships thank you
02:12:06.639 very very very
02:12:08.559 much well thank thank you thank you that
02:12:12.840 that that makes us feel
02:12:16.400 good question is uh what have your teams
02:12:20.800 great learnings been on business Capital
02:12:24.360 allocation stock baking and portfolio
02:12:27.719 allocation uh throughout the co9
02:12:30.239 pandemic period over the last 5 years
02:12:32.440 and waren appreciate it if you can get
02:12:34.360 your views as well as uh your you
02:12:38.119 representations on Ted and Todd as well
02:12:40.960 as directly from Greg and Ajit to on
02:12:43.280 their respective businesses thank you
02:12:46.119 yeah I I don't think I want to give
02:12:49.320 individual appraisals uh
02:12:51.840 and but but uh what really what you're
02:12:58.360 doing is uh in terms of capital
02:13:01.320 allocation which is is my job I don't go
02:13:05.400 out and sell insurance policies or
02:13:06.960 anything of the sort uh and you
02:13:10.840 represent a group of shareholders like
02:13:13.280 we do represent we we are totally clear
02:13:17.400 on our
02:13:18.559 mission
02:13:20.119 and you know it it may be that other
02:13:22.840 people don't agree with them but I would
02:13:24.159 say that in a great many places uh you
02:13:27.840 know I I I I just don't agree with their
02:13:30.520 mission and
02:13:33.679 uh you know I would say that for example
02:13:36.559 that any anybody that wants to return
02:13:39.480 retire at 65 would be disqualified from
02:13:42.520 being CEO of Berkshire then they might
02:13:45.880 get just they might get retired the next
02:13:48.679 day if they were the wrong person but
02:13:50.320 that that there's just certain things we
02:13:52.760 don't want and uh uh
02:14:00.239 the we're well fixed
02:14:03.360 now
02:14:06.840 and that the odds are very
02:14:10.000 good but far from
02:14:12.400 certainty that that takes care of the
02:14:14.280 next 20 years
02:14:16.800 now
02:14:18.400 the but you have to provide for the cont
02:14:21.079 mercy and and
02:14:24.079 uh
02:14:26.520 uh
02:14:28.920 I there's
02:14:31.079 several people on the board that know
02:14:33.280 what I would do on that but it's up to
02:14:35.440 Greg but Greg and I go at the same time
02:14:38.119 then then then you'll move into making
02:14:41.679 another decision and and uh
02:14:45.599 uh you know there a few people know my
02:14:48.920 thoughts on that but but
02:14:51.760 they the the job of the director is then
02:14:54.679 to come up with the right CEO and the
02:14:58.599 right
02:15:00.480 CEO can't make a terrible business great
02:15:04.960 Tom
02:15:06.079 Murphy who was the best he was the best
02:15:09.480 business manager I've ever known and Tom
02:15:13.360 Murphy you know he said the real key was
02:15:18.119 buying the right business and now murf
02:15:21.440 brought a million other attributes to it
02:15:23.760 after that but you know
02:15:27.960 it Charlie you know said we we you know
02:15:32.960 what was this he had a saying on that
02:15:35.000 but but
02:15:37.360 basically we could have brought in Tom
02:15:40.360 Murphy and told him his job was to run
02:15:42.159 the textile
02:15:43.480 business and it would have done a little
02:15:45.960 bit
02:15:46.960 better but it still would have failed
02:15:50.760 and and uh one of the reasons I stuck
02:15:54.639 with the textile business as long as I
02:15:58.159 did was that I liked Ken Chase so much
02:16:01.480 and I thought he was a terrific guy and
02:16:05.040 he was was a very good
02:16:07.320 manager and if he'd been a jerk you know
02:16:11.480 we'd have quit the textile business much
02:16:13.280 faster we'd have been better off but so
02:16:16.440 so the answer was for him to get in the
02:16:19.719 in the TV business like murf had done
02:16:21.840 and AD supported the you know murf murf
02:16:26.119 figured that out early and he started
02:16:27.800 with a
02:16:28.880 pathetic operation which was a VHF in
02:16:33.478 Aly New York competing against GE and
02:16:36.879 everything and he was operating out of a
02:16:38.478 home for retired nuns and he only
02:16:40.478 painted the side that faded faced the
02:16:42.920 street he had one car dashing around
02:16:46.599 town and he called it news truck number
02:16:48.920 six but from M he
02:16:52.558 built an incredible company and he built
02:16:55.318 it because he was the best manager I've
02:16:57.160 ever met but beyond that he was in a
02:17:00.760 good business and uh
02:17:06.760 uh the key will be to ke will be to find
02:17:10.318 another Tom Murphy and then hand him a
02:17:12.519 bunch of good businesses and and he or
02:17:15.718 she will know what to do with
02:17:19.359 it now that's not as precise as you
02:17:22.959 would get
02:17:24.240 in uh in most companies but you really
02:17:27.200 can't get more precise than that I mean
02:17:29.160 you can have committees and management
02:17:31.799 consultants and everybody but it wasn't
02:17:35.359 a Management Consultant that hired Tom
02:17:38.000 Murphy and and I forget whether he was
02:17:41.879 doing his sales volume was couple th000
02:17:45.318 a week at first and then soon as he hit
02:17:48.040 that was his goal got the 2,000 he say
02:17:50.638 now my goal is 3,000 he kept doing that
02:17:54.080 and he surpassed all these people like
02:17:56.240 CBS and ABC that on the had the World by
02:17:59.200 the tail and uh it was just a wonderful
02:18:02.599 lesson in life to get just to be able to
02:18:06.799 view something like that I
02:18:08.519 learned an awful lot from what he said
02:18:12.959 to me but I just learned by watching
02:18:17.240 somebody like him operate I mean it's
02:18:19.359 it's it's like watching a great golfer a
02:18:22.359 great tennis player then you you ought
02:18:24.638 to learn something about the kind of
02:18:27.000 Swing you're trying to develop or
02:18:28.519 something sort so that's that's not a
02:18:31.519 great answer for you but it's it's uh so
02:18:35.040 far it's worked and I think it
02:18:38.558 works I'm very sure it works with Greg
02:18:42.439 and it's up to people in the future
02:18:44.799 when you know at uh I'm underground or
02:18:49.200 wherever they put me
02:18:51.558 uh to really make a decision every 20
02:18:54.920 years or something like that on average
02:18:56.840 it's the right decision but correct that
02:18:58.638 if it turns out to be the wrong decision
02:19:01.120 that's what a board of directors is for
02:19:03.280 and uh and we've got the people on the
02:19:09.318 board
02:19:12.000 that really understand that
02:19:15.558 responsibility they take it
02:19:18.318 seriously but they don't take themselves
02:19:20.439 to
02:19:21.359 seriously and uh so therefore they
02:19:25.760 don't they don't want to they don't
02:19:28.558 necessarily want to do a lot of things
02:19:30.000 just to look
02:19:31.240 busy uh they aren't using us as a
02:19:34.318 stepping stone to get on other
02:19:36.398 boards but we've got people that that uh
02:19:41.439 really believe in what we're doing and
02:19:43.599 uh and the ones that are going to have
02:19:46.840 to make
02:19:47.799 this place work and if they got lucky on
02:19:52.120 Greg's mortality they they can do just
02:19:56.200 what rep do go to sleep for 20 years or
02:19:59.520 so and then make another decision and uh
02:20:04.920 and Berkshire
02:20:07.160 has every tool in the world
02:20:12.800 available to
02:20:15.120 be what it is now and continue to be
02:20:18.160 what it is now I mean that we've gotten
02:20:21.880 from from 20 million of that Worth to
02:20:26.520 5 70
02:20:28.800 billion and
02:20:30.960 uh uh you know
02:20:33.880 we there aren't as many things to do but
02:20:36.880 we can do a few big things better than
02:20:38.640 anybody else can do and there will be
02:20:41.000 occasional
02:20:42.840 times when we're the only one willing
02:20:47.399 to act and those
02:20:51.160 times we want to be sure that the US
02:20:54.240 government thinks we're an asset to the
02:20:56.319 situation and not a liability or a
02:21:00.840 supplicant you know as the banks were
02:21:03.120 will say in 2008 and9 that they were
02:21:06.600 they were all tarred with the same brush
02:21:10.439 but we want to be sure that the brush
02:21:14.800 that determines our future it uh you
02:21:19.160 know is not hard and uh and I think
02:21:22.560 we're in
02:21:23.560 the I don't think anybody's got a better
02:21:25.960 position to do it than
02:21:33.680 Berkshire
02:21:35.200 Bey uh this questions from Johan Halen
02:21:38.760 who writes you're sitting on 168 billion
02:21:42.200 of cash which you told us today is now
02:21:44.680 more than $182 billion his questions are
02:21:48.080 one what is Buffett waiting for and two
02:21:50.600 to why not at least deploy some of
02:21:53.920 it well I think that's pretty easy to
02:21:58.800 answer I I I don't think anybody sitting
02:22:02.800 at this table has has any idea of how to
02:22:08.880 use it effectively and therefore we
02:22:10.920 don't we don't use it and we don't use
02:22:13.920 it now at
02:22:15.240 5.4% but we wouldn't use it if it if it
02:22:18.120 was at
02:22:19.200 1% um
02:22:21.800 don't tell um the Federal Reserve that
02:22:24.840 but
02:22:26.319 but prefer it but the uh
02:22:31.319 uh we don't we only swing at pitches we
02:22:35.439 like and um uh if uh anybody tried to
02:22:41.760 swing at every
02:22:43.200 pitch uh or felt that because they
02:22:46.760 hadn't swung at a pitch for two for the
02:22:48.920 last two pitches they ought to swing of
02:22:50.319 the third one or something like that
02:22:51.960 that it it's just it's
02:22:55.479 uh there are times and obviously but I
02:22:59.960 would say this I I would not like to be
02:23:01.800 running 10 billion now 10 million I
02:23:05.359 think we could I think Charlie or I
02:23:08.080 could earn high Returns on because I
02:23:10.000 think there's there there just a few
02:23:12.319 things that happen on a very very small
02:23:14.920 scale but but it it it it uh if we had
02:23:21.319 10
02:23:22.279 billion uh we wouldn't I wouldn't
02:23:26.720 basically
02:23:27.920 see I know many more opportunities than
02:23:31.479 we found now it's true that something
02:23:33.279 like Japan we could have done if the
02:23:35.920 company had had a 30 or 40 billion and
02:23:38.200 we'd make we' have had great Returns on
02:23:41.000 Equity but if I saw one of those now I'd
02:23:43.000 do it for Berkshire that uh you know it
02:23:46.240 isn't like I'm got a hunger strike or
02:23:49.520 something like that going on uh it's
02:23:52.279 just that they things aren't attractive
02:23:57.120 and uh and
02:24:00.960 there's well there certain ways that can
02:24:03.600 change and we'll see whether they
02:24:08.200 do okay station
02:24:12.200 10 Mr Buffett this is an incredible
02:24:14.760 meeting that you host every year my name
02:24:16.399 is Shan colie I am a real estate agent
02:24:19.640 with Burk hathway Home Services in
02:24:21.600 Arizona and California my mother Cindy
02:24:24.399 my brother and my two sisters all sell
02:24:26.359 real estate with birkshire hathway home
02:24:27.960 services for many years we love being a
02:24:30.479 part of the birkshire family and along
02:24:32.560 with the 70,000 other agents that sell
02:24:34.720 real estate for the company uh Mr
02:24:36.920 Buffett Home Services of America
02:24:38.439 recently settled our class action
02:24:40.240 lawsuit regarding commissions for $250
02:24:42.680 Million last week uh this is uh this
02:24:46.000 dollar meants about 100 million more
02:24:47.399 than Keller Williams
02:24:50.600 more than anywhere real estate which is
02:24:52.000 Better Homes and Gardens in Coldwell
02:24:53.600 Banker as a realtor with birkar hathway
02:24:56.680 home services and multiple markets and a
02:24:58.640 shareholder who's been coming to this
02:25:00.399 meeting for 15 straight years uh that's
02:25:03.359 one of the reasons I got involved with
02:25:04.479 real estate is because of this meeting
02:25:06.160 what are your thoughts on buying and
02:25:07.560 selling a home in light of this re
02:25:09.399 recent settlement and uh I maybe asked
02:25:12.439 the note to Greg and AET too would you
02:25:14.680 consider a birkar agent when buying your
02:25:16.560 next
02:25:18.080 home well I don't buy him that often
02:25:22.200 some people have noted but uh I
02:25:25.920 certainly would consider him but uh i'
02:25:29.120 say the probability of that happening is
02:25:30.800 low but and I I really appreciate uh the
02:25:33.600 fact you've joined up with us but I'm
02:25:35.240 going
02:25:35.880 to in in terms of the uh the uh
02:25:40.399 settlement I
02:25:42.120 mean Craig get me informed but I I
02:25:45.720 turned it over 100% to him but uh so
02:25:48.760 Greg you want to talk about it
02:25:51.040 sure so thank you for uh you and your
02:25:54.160 family for being an agent and working
02:25:56.479 for our for our company uh Berkshire
02:25:59.120 outway Home Services I think there's a
02:26:01.160 few questions in there one there's no
02:26:04.319 question the industry will go through
02:26:06.040 some transitions because of that
02:26:08.359 settlement ours and the every other
02:26:11.200 major player in the industry settled the
02:26:14.840 National Association of Realtors settled
02:26:17.399 for more than 400 million so um
02:26:21.040 effectively everybody was swept up in in
02:26:24.040 that uh settlement and it did set the
02:26:27.560 grounds for the both home services and
02:26:30.920 for the industry to move
02:26:33.560 forward the there's a lot of changes
02:26:35.880 that happen in or are being proposed
02:26:38.760 associated with that settlement but the
02:26:41.240 the one thing that I I think you
02:26:43.800 hopefully would absolutely agree with
02:26:45.240 that the real estate agent is still an
02:26:48.040 important part of of these transactions
02:26:50.640 it's the one time in our lives where we
02:26:52.680 make these massive uh Investments and
02:26:56.120 having that counseling guidance is is
02:26:58.520 critical and that's really what our
02:27:00.120 business and those other businesses uh
02:27:02.720 rely on how the commission structures
02:27:05.720 change and how it's negotiated which is
02:27:08.160 really what the settlement was it was no
02:27:10.880 longer that a buyer um uh would
02:27:15.600 automatically pay a a commission agent
02:27:18.359 to the to the selling agent that how now
02:27:21.040 has to be negotiated that'll impact
02:27:23.840 things but I think the
02:27:26.040 realators uh will continue to be a very
02:27:28.720 important part of that and I think Home
02:27:30.800 Services in the industry will remain
02:27:32.960 very relevant and then the only thing I
02:27:35.240 would share with our shareholders on a
02:27:37.240 broader basis is that obligation resides
02:27:40.960 with home services and can be met by
02:27:44.359 Home Services and that was an important
02:27:46.960 condition because they were also uh
02:27:49.160 pursuing Berkshire in Brookshire hathway
02:27:50.960 energy and we said you can Pro pursue us
02:27:53.560 separately but um that settlement will
02:27:56.479 reside with home services and be an
02:27:58.399 obligation of that and they decided the
02:28:00.960 the ultimate settlement and and uh and
02:28:05.080 we'll go forward from there so wen't any
02:28:07.560 other comp well yeah I've sold two
02:28:09.840 houses in the last well the last 93 a
02:28:15.640 fraction years and and I've and I've and
02:28:19.600 I've uh bought one uh uh that I still
02:28:24.240 have but I obviously bought the other
02:28:25.800 two it and uh
02:28:29.080 uh I I have I have not negotiated down
02:28:35.479 the commission even
02:28:37.319 though uh the last one sold for 7
02:28:40.880 million or something like that people do
02:28:42.680 negotiate down commissions to some
02:28:44.520 extent but I can tell you I've looked at
02:28:46.399 the figures and
02:28:47.760 I I think the system is really worked
02:28:50.279 out very well they when I when I got out
02:28:52.200 of school they had you know what they
02:28:53.520 called fsbo you know with with for sale
02:28:56.080 by owner and uh so i' I've I've been
02:29:00.760 involved to some degree in watching the
02:29:03.240 whole system operate and uh and I know
02:29:06.120 what our average agent makes I know you
02:29:08.760 know how long they work on things
02:29:11.319 sometimes that get don't materialize I
02:29:15.120 it it it uh I don't think we will'll end
02:29:17.960 up with a a
02:29:20.720 better system and uh but you know it's
02:29:24.479 up to it's up to Greg and the the people
02:29:27.560 at home services we work it through here
02:29:29.880 but I I I I like our Agency Group and I
02:29:33.680 uh we've got a very large number as you
02:29:37.840 of of BR estate agents and I've
02:29:40.279 encouraged us the expansion we've done
02:29:44.479 in the real estate agent uh real estate
02:29:47.359 broke breach business uh you know it was
02:29:50.880 just one or two operations when we
02:29:52.560 bought Brookshire halfway energy and we
02:29:55.399 we really built built up quite a company
02:29:57.479 and and uh uh I think it's a very
02:30:01.760 fundamental business you need
02:30:04.200 help 90% of the people need help you
02:30:07.640 know in buying them buying a a home or
02:30:11.359 selling one and uh and I've watched it
02:30:14.439 operate all my life and been involved
02:30:16.960 with lots of people who have been in the
02:30:19.240 business and
02:30:20.680 uh but there was a decision in court and
02:30:24.479 I told I told Greg to handle it whatever
02:30:26.600 will seemed best to him and I'm quite
02:30:29.680 I'm I'm perfectly happy with the way
02:30:31.760 we've handled I think I'm surprised at
02:30:35.960 the the decision but uh but uh it uh we
02:30:42.800 get surprised in decisions in in the
02:30:45.319 insurance business lots of times I mean
02:30:47.680 just just think of the the
02:30:50.520 various things we faced and
02:30:53.720 and you know when 9/11 came along you
02:30:58.279 know we never thought something like
02:30:59.560 that could happen but it happened and
02:31:02.120 then we didn't know what was one event
02:31:04.359 or more events I mean if you if they
02:31:06.960 close down the New York Stock Exchange
02:31:08.960 and a bunch of
02:31:11.080 Brokers well every all kinds of people
02:31:13.600 lose their jobs and or or lose their
02:31:16.319 income for a while is that one event or
02:31:18.439 multiple events well there's all kinds
02:31:20.800 of things come up in business and and we
02:31:23.560 just we we we play the play the ball
02:31:28.040 whereever we find it and uh and uh I was
02:31:32.960 surprised by the decision was it in
02:31:35.439 Missouri but uh is there yes yeah but
02:31:39.279 we've gotten surprised by some other
02:31:40.800 decisions and we'll keep doing sensible
02:31:43.120 things as we move forward Greg do you
02:31:45.040 want
02:31:45.760 to yeah um no I think the only thing I
02:31:48.960 would add back maybe to how the model
02:31:51.359 has changed in the asked one yes we'll
02:31:53.640 always I can't speak for a Jeep but
02:31:55.319 we'll always use Home Services agents
02:31:57.359 but uh it's interesting I have bought a
02:31:59.720 home abroad because I I lived over in
02:32:02.000 the United Kingdom uh in Newcastle
02:32:04.760 running our uh utility over there and it
02:32:08.120 is a completely different experience to
02:32:10.200 buy a home outside of the US uh our
02:32:13.319 agents take great responsibility for the
02:32:16.279 the whole transaction in the US they put
02:32:18.680 as Warren said time and capital uh at
02:32:22.800 risk to ensure the transaction closes
02:32:25.800 and when you do close it they make sure
02:32:27.640 what you bought you actually what you
02:32:29.800 thought you were purchasing you end up
02:32:31.600 with and and that's not the way it is
02:32:34.640 always around the world and there are
02:32:36.319 more affordable models but it's the old
02:32:39.359 thing you get what you pay for so I I
02:32:41.560 think our real estate agents still
02:32:43.200 provide incredible value within our
02:32:45.160 business and and that as Warren touched
02:32:47.160 on it it'll it'll survive the the the
02:32:49.840 form may be a little bit different but
02:32:51.880 there's no question it'll it'll it'll
02:32:54.359 continue to
02:32:55.600 thrive yeah we still we we still will
02:32:58.560 we'll want to buy real estate brokerages
02:33:01.120 at the right price and uh I hope we're
02:33:04.439 bigger in the industry 10 years from now
02:33:07.000 and 20 years from now than we are
02:33:08.600 currently and I did sell a house for 7
02:33:11.800 million I did not negotiate the 6% down
02:33:14.840 and I feel I got my money's worth than
02:33:16.560 then some and I'm cheap by Nature so
02:33:21.520 it is it is I'm careless about it I I
02:33:23.800 just I got my money's worth and uh so
02:33:27.600 let's move on to
02:33:29.040 Bey uh this question is for Warren and a
02:33:31.600 g it's from Jeff oyster as a Burkshire
02:33:34.960 and Tesla shareholder I would like to
02:33:36.640 hear your thoughts on the potential
02:33:38.240 Financial effects to Geico assuming Elon
02:33:41.279 Musk delivers on his fully autonomous
02:33:44.120 driving goal on Tesla's most recent
02:33:46.399 earnings call Elon said if you've got it
02:33:49.160 scale statistically significant amount
02:33:51.319 of data that shows conclusively that the
02:33:53.760 autonomous car has let's say half the
02:33:56.399 accident rate of a human driven car I
02:33:58.800 think that's difficult to ignore ignore
02:34:01.319 assuming Elon succeeds in reducing
02:34:03.560 accidents by 50% versus human drivers
02:34:06.120 wouldn't auto insurance rates fall to
02:34:08.160 reflect the reduced underwriting risk
02:34:10.000 thereby adversely impacting Geico's
02:34:12.560 revenues and float and perhaps margins
02:34:15.640 Too Well yeah if it if it if it
02:34:20.319 if well let's just take the extreme
02:34:22.640 example let's say there are only going
02:34:23.880 to be three accidents in the United
02:34:26.040 States next year for some crazy reason
02:34:28.200 that that uh uh anything that reduces uh
02:34:33.600 uh accidents is is going to reduce cost
02:34:38.800 but that that's been harder to do than
02:34:42.560 people have done before but obviously
02:34:44.479 but if it really happens uh the figures
02:34:48.279 will show it and our data will show it
02:34:50.160 and the prices will come down I
02:34:53.120 would there have been a lot of people
02:34:55.120 talk about doing that in the past I mean
02:34:58.000 General Motors used to be very big in
02:34:59.960 the insurance business and and when Uber
02:35:03.399 first started they they uh use some firm
02:35:08.200 which now is I think a jle confirmed
02:35:11.600 they're close to bankruptcy now aren't
02:35:13.120 they because of taking things on at the
02:35:15.040 wrong
02:35:15.840 prices is that true of Y yeah yeah it it
02:35:21.439 Insurance always looks easier than it is
02:35:23.399 and it's so much fun because you get the
02:35:25.000 money at the start you know and then you
02:35:27.080 find out whether you've done something
02:35:28.399 stupid later on but but in you know it's
02:35:32.240 it's it's it's a very tempting business
02:35:34.399 when somebody hands you money and you
02:35:35.960 hand them a little piece of paper but uh
02:35:39.920 really knowing whether you're I mean if
02:35:43.720 if if accidents get reduced 50% it's
02:35:47.040 going to be good for society and it's
02:35:49.240 going to be bad for insurance company's
02:35:51.399 volume but but but but you know good for
02:35:54.800 society is is what we're looking for so
02:35:58.760 far this you might find kind of
02:36:01.279 interesting I mean the the number of
02:36:03.880 people
02:36:04.960 killed per 100 million passenger
02:36:08.359 miles uh
02:36:10.240 driven uh I think it actually was the
02:36:14.120 when I was young it was like 15 but even
02:36:17.520 post World War II it only felt of like
02:36:21.279 seven or thereabouts and and Ralph nater
02:36:25.399 probably has done more for the American
02:36:27.359 Consumer than just about anybody in in
02:36:30.800 history because uh that seven or six is
02:36:35.279 now come down to under two and and I
02:36:37.520 don't think it would have come down that
02:36:38.920 way without
02:36:40.800 him uh there have been some kind of
02:36:43.560 fluke figures of what people did during
02:36:46.200 the pandemic which are quite interesting
02:36:48.359 because they they didn't drive
02:36:50.800 immediately they didn't drive as many
02:36:52.319 miles but they they drove more
02:36:54.760 dangerously didn't they is that right a
02:36:57.399 y yeah so the point I want to make in
02:37:00.439 terms of Tesla and the fact that they
02:37:03.680 feel that because of their technology
02:37:06.800 the number of accidents do come down and
02:37:09.479 that is certainly Pro provable but I
02:37:12.359 think what needs to be factored in as
02:37:14.439 well is the the repair cost of each one
02:37:17.279 of these accidents has skyrocketed
02:37:20.040 so if you multiply the number of
02:37:21.840 accidents times the cost of each
02:37:24.160 accident I'm not sure uh that total
02:37:27.279 number has come down as much as Tesla
02:37:29.840 would like us to believe Tesla has been
02:37:32.359 toying with the idea of writing
02:37:34.600 Insurance directly or indirectly and so
02:37:37.680 far it hasn't really sort of been much
02:37:40.520 of a success time will tell but I think
02:37:43.520 uh you know automation just shifts a lot
02:37:46.560 of the expense from the operator to the
02:37:51.040 equipment
02:37:53.880 provider okay we're getting close to
02:37:56.120 noon when we're going to break for lunch
02:37:57.960 I just want
02:37:59.080 to tell everybody that I uh would
02:38:04.160 appreciate it very much if they will get
02:38:07.160 in their seats and be ready at at 1:00
02:38:10.800 when we reconvene because we will have
02:38:14.040 another very short little movie and
02:38:15.880 we'll just have a a little explanation
02:38:18.439 of something that I think will be of
02:38:21.600 interest certainly of interest to me but
02:38:24.080 it uh uh so I would like to we will
02:38:29.000 break promptly at 12: and I would like
02:38:32.520 everybody to uh uh really make an
02:38:36.319 attempt to be in their seat and
02:38:39.840 quiet at 1:00 and if you can't do that
02:38:45.560 if you'll wait a few minutes and watch
02:38:50.680 in the halls and all that but we will we
02:38:52.600 do not want to be seting people and have
02:38:54.680 people Milling here at 1:00 and just
02:38:58.720 like a play in New York or something
02:39:00.479 we'll it'll take a few minutes and only
02:39:03.160 a few minutes to cover what we're going
02:39:04.800 to it at uh at 1:00 but uh we don't want
02:39:10.399 to
02:39:11.120 be uh seting people during that period
02:39:15.520 but now now let's uh we'll go on till
02:39:18.200 12:00 and then have a break until
02:39:20.680 1:00 and uh we will go to station
02:39:27.840 11 my name is Humphrey Lou and I am from
02:39:32.640 Charlottesville
02:39:34.560 Virginia I asked the question last year
02:39:37.520 and wish to pose it again it can be
02:39:40.080 considered a
02:39:41.720 followup there is something to be said
02:39:44.000 for
02:39:45.560 traditions it is the same question but
02:39:48.240 it is a changing and different world we
02:39:50.120 are
02:39:51.319 in looking at Global Trends it
02:39:54.800 increasingly does seem that zero
02:39:56.920 emission Vehicles may have finally
02:39:59.279 reached the cusp of massive
02:40:02.160 adoption do you see any opportunities in
02:40:05.160 this space either in specific vehicle
02:40:08.760 manufacturers or in related
02:40:11.520 Technologies as an addendum I will note
02:40:13.960 that Berkshire has very relevant
02:40:15.800 interests in energy Pilot Flying J and
02:40:20.439 byd thank you yeah well we will I hope
02:40:24.319 you're right
02:40:26.120 and uh massive adoption is has been sort
02:40:31.640 of a moving Target so far
02:40:34.720 but I hope we get there but Berkshire
02:40:38.080 would not
02:40:39.920 be I don't think that we bring any
02:40:43.800 special
02:40:45.000 talent to that
02:40:47.120 field uh you've got to be a call
02:40:50.399 manufacturers and uh uh I would
02:40:53.600 certainly not know how to pick the
02:40:55.040 winners in an industry like that but
02:40:59.359 I'll be delighted if there there are
02:41:01.960 some
02:41:02.800 winners uh but don't count on us for
02:41:07.120 seeing who the winners will be and don't
02:41:09.279 count on us for predicting when
02:41:11.800 something will
02:41:14.080 happen uh it obviously has been a moving
02:41:17.800 Target so far and and
02:41:20.720 uh it is an incredible problem that
02:41:24.520 Society faces and and
02:41:28.880 uh it it may be that uh
02:41:33.920 that it may be that uh governments are
02:41:36.880 not very good at solving it for a while
02:41:39.080 it's it's uh uh all of climate change
02:41:43.800 is it's got a terrible problem just in
02:41:46.520 the fact that you know in affect the
02:41:50.399 the United States particularly has been
02:41:53.160 the one that's caused the problem the
02:41:55.880 most and then we're asking poor
02:41:57.720 societies to say well you've got to
02:42:00.359 change the way you live because we lived
02:42:02.319 the way we did and uh
02:42:07.200 uh you know
02:42:10.040 that that really hasn't been settled yet
02:42:13.040 it uh uh you know it it it's a
02:42:18.560 fascinating problem to me but I don't
02:42:20.160 have anything to
02:42:21.520 add to how you really slice through the
02:42:25.279 world when I was born in 1930 there were
02:42:28.800 just essentially two billion people in
02:42:31.520 the
02:42:32.319 world uh population statistic now
02:42:36.000 there's 8 billion now if you'd asked
02:42:38.720 anybody in 1930 if you take the 50
02:42:40.880 smartest people in the world and you
02:42:42.359 said what's the op Optimum
02:42:45.200 population uh for the world when you're
02:42:48.200 93 years old they would have not said 8
02:42:50.319 billion there wouldn't be anybody been
02:42:52.000 close to it but we did it now we're
02:42:56.319 reaping some of the consequences of
02:42:58.200 having having done that and uh we got
02:43:02.720 the benefits in the United States I'm
02:43:05.399 exaggerating here to some extent but the
02:43:07.080 developed World basically got it and
02:43:09.160 then we're telling a whole bunch of
02:43:11.439 other people that we want them to change
02:43:13.960 the way they live live because of the
02:43:15.880 way they live we we lived uh way they
02:43:18.880 lived
02:43:19.680 so we will see what happens with it but
02:43:24.120 uh that's that's a problem that that is
02:43:28.680 the very very very hard to sell that
02:43:32.120 solve uh among a couple hundred
02:43:34.920 countries and I really don't have
02:43:36.600 anything to be to be
02:43:40.000 uh uh to contribute on it and now I've
02:43:44.520 got instructions from the thing there
02:43:46.600 the
02:43:47.399 the the monitor in front of me I would
02:43:50.640 like to introduce one person
02:43:52.880 here uh that uh uh
02:43:59.080 has you you all know because she's been
02:44:02.600 her so many times but um uh my friend
02:44:07.880 Carol
02:44:08.880 Lumis
02:44:10.600 who is now well she's going to be 95 on
02:44:14.560 June June 25th uh you can send president
02:44:18.160 care of our office
02:44:20.000 uh and Carol has edited the mercher
02:44:24.560 annual
02:44:31.200 report since since
02:44:35.760 1977 I there we are
02:44:37.830 [Applause]
02:44:47.680 and and there's
02:44:50.000 there are two points I'd like to
02:44:51.880 mention every year I give
02:44:55.760 Carol a uh little
02:45:00.120 um item for a bracelet that is a replica
02:45:03.600 of the front page of the report that
02:45:05.520 year and they're different colors and
02:45:06.880 all of that sort of thing and so she now
02:45:10.800 has what since
02:45:14.399 1977 what 47 of them and she I think
02:45:17.399 she's put 10 on each one but
02:45:21.120 uh I I I've always wondered you know if
02:45:25.000 she'd put them all on
02:45:26.880 one one arm with one arm would now be
02:45:30.399 four or five Ines longer than the other
02:45:33.479 and but I'm sure she's she foresaw that
02:45:37.920 but I want to reveal one other I want to
02:45:40.520 reveal I well I want to ask one more
02:45:43.200 question uh while Carol was here
02:45:46.600 because uh I'm sure almost everybody in
02:45:50.000 this
02:45:50.840 audience grew up like I did uh knowing
02:45:55.120 that
02:45:57.040 tiops lifetime batting average was 367 I
02:46:01.880 mean he's the leader among everyone and
02:46:05.439 uh it may be that that record is never
02:46:08.800 broken and
02:46:11.160 taob 367
02:46:14.960 Immortal but
02:46:17.279 uh Carol
02:46:20.520 uh has a distinction that probably most
02:46:22.720 of you don't know
02:46:24.399 but uh she dated
02:46:27.760 Tab
02:46:29.840 and and
02:46:33.319 Carol
02:46:35.880 uh was was
02:46:38.120 officed at uh 6th
02:46:40.920 Avenue and uh in 50th Street in the time
02:46:45.240 life
02:46:46.040 building and NBC was right across the
02:46:48.640 street Street in in uh Rockefeller
02:46:54.040 Center and the quiz shows became the
02:46:58.120 head of
02:47:00.520 TV and Carol being the kind of person
02:47:03.960 she is walked across the street at
02:47:07.880 lunchtime and went on the qu show of the
02:47:12.359 late
02:47:13.680 1950s and they gave her
02:47:16.160 the indust or they gave her the question
02:47:19.560 regarding
02:47:20.760 baseball and Carol answered them all
02:47:22.960 correctly of course she was encyclopedic
02:47:25.399 on all kinds of things but so she knew
02:47:27.960 all the
02:47:29.840 answers
02:47:31.520 and
02:47:33.040 she proceeded that she was single at the
02:47:35.920 time and she proceeded back to her
02:47:38.600 office at fortune and at some point she
02:47:40.600 got a phone
02:47:41.920 call
02:47:44.120 from sounded like a fairly young man in
02:47:47.200 Georgia and he said my uncle this Tai
02:47:50.760 cob and he would like to take you to
02:47:53.920 lunch at
02:47:55.399 21 and so Carol went to lunch with taob
02:48:00.640 at 21 and and I think he subsequently
02:48:03.439 had one more lunch and then she decided
02:48:07.840 to call it off uh
02:48:12.439 but those of you who follow baseball may
02:48:15.920 have noticed that in the 1990s
02:48:21.800 they found that the statistics had been
02:48:24.439 faulty when T cob played and that he
02:48:28.680 actually only batted
02:48:31.200 366 uh that there were a couple of B
02:48:33.479 bats they didn't
02:48:35.200 count so the real
02:48:38.160 question I want to know with from Carol
02:48:40.680 and I think she should maybe tell us is
02:48:44.000 that would she have dated ta cob if she
02:48:47.920 not I mean I I know she wouldn't have I
02:48:49.920 know she wouldn't have dated taob if his
02:48:51.640 batting average had been 300 or
02:48:53.319 something like that but where was the
02:48:56.040 cut off point at which she would have
02:48:59.080 told Tai cob to stay in Atlanta and
02:49:01.479 forget about coming up to New York and
02:49:04.120 if Carol would if anybody has a
02:49:06.399 microphone Carol would care to express
02:49:09.000 herself on on that question it's the
02:49:11.560 unanswered question I've had in all
02:49:14.640 inquiring minds have had and uh uh
02:49:19.239 only she knows the
02:49:22.479 answer and she's with her daughter she
02:49:24.880 married a wonderful guy John Lewis and
02:49:26.880 Barbara's Barbara's wither I'm I'm sure
02:49:29.520 Barbara's been always wanting to ask
02:49:31.399 this question but I've it it's it's kind
02:49:34.680 of tough when you're in the family but I
02:49:36.800 am I'm sort of an noxious guy I will do
02:49:39.120 it in front of a lot of people
02:49:42.880 Carol
02:49:45.479 zero or or we can have Barbara's guest
02:49:48.880 either one was she she she would have
02:49:51.920 been happy to go either way right you
02:49:54.239 would have
02:49:56.880 gone thank you
02:50:03.800 Carol Carol Carol is the best business
02:50:06.880 writer she comes up the town of Cole
02:50:08.399 Camp Missouri you know I don't know
02:50:10.160 about say around a thousand probably she
02:50:12.880 never took an accounting course and she
02:50:15.239 ended up becoming the best business
02:50:16.800 writer in the United States
02:50:19.840 and uh uh we you know she didn't want to
02:50:25.080 be an editor actually I mean she could
02:50:27.399 have done other things at Fortune but
02:50:29.600 she just plain liked writing business
02:50:32.239 stories and like I say that uh nobody
02:50:35.600 came close to her and she started from
02:50:38.479 scratch uh but
02:50:42.319 uh in
02:50:44.960 1977 I asked her to edit my report
02:50:49.439 and she turned out to be just as th an
02:50:53.560 editor she was a
02:50:55.200 writer and
02:50:57.000 it uh all the way through this year
02:51:01.680 including this year Carol has edited the
02:51:06.319 Berkshire
02:51:07.520 report and uh to the exent anybody
02:51:11.160 enjoys reading them let's give a hand to
02:51:13.680 Carol
02:51:26.399 okay and I've been told to show a video
02:51:28.439 right before you go to lunch because
02:51:30.040 it's only 30 some seconds and then we'll
02:51:31.960 talk a little bit about more about it
02:51:33.960 when we come so if we'll uh dim the
02:51:37.960 lights we will we will have we
02:51:41.399 showing what a birer
02:51:45.680 shareholder
02:51:47.359 did uh uh when she sold us a billion
02:51:52.120 dollars worth of stock the other day and
02:51:54.479 you'll beet somebody that I is the op is
02:51:59.319 I know she is the Prototype she may have
02:52:02.040 more zeros but she's the Prototype of a
02:52:04.080 good many burshire high the way Sher
02:52:06.680 it'll be the first thing we talk about
02:52:08.239 when we come back but some of you may
02:52:11.279 have noticed whenever it was few weeks
02:52:14.880 back when Ruth
02:52:17.040 goisman gave $1 billion to Albert
02:52:20.880 Einstein to take care of all the
02:52:28.160 and Ruth doesn't like a lot of attention
02:52:30.800 drawn to herself but here's how they
02:52:33.840 felt at Albert Einstein when they
02:52:36.760 announced that Ruth Ruth goddman had
02:52:39.319 just made a decision to take care of of
02:52:43.279 all the all of the costs
02:52:46.479 of Education at Albert
02:52:49.840 Einstein and it's going to be in
02:52:52.200 perpetuity so let's just show the
02:52:54.840 film I'm happy to share with you that
02:52:58.399 starting in August this year the Albert
02:53:02.239 Einstein College of Medicine will be
02:53:05.319 tuition free
02:53:08.030 [Applause]
02:53:40.200 and that's why Charlie and I have had
02:53:42.279 such fun running Burger
02:53:52.840 she transferred a billion
02:53:54.680 dollars to other people she Happ to do
02:53:57.880 with Berkshire
02:53:59.279 stock and uh and you know they offered
02:54:03.800 the name rename the school after and
02:54:06.319 everything like that but she said
02:54:08.439 howbert Einstein that's that's a pretty
02:54:10.720 good name to start with so you there's
02:54:13.279 no ego involved in it know nothing she
02:54:15.960 just decided that that she'd there
02:54:19.239 have 100 plus closer to 150 eventually
02:54:23.720 of
02:54:25.399 students be able to start out debt-free
02:54:29.920 and and uh proceed in
02:54:33.800 life and she did it
02:54:36.520 happily and she did it without somebody
02:54:39.680 asking you know name it you know put my
02:54:43.080 name on four all four sides of neon
02:54:45.720 lights and I Salu
02:54:59.560 her so let's all have lunch and we'll
02:55:02.200 come back and talk a little bit more
02:55:03.479 about that
02:55:06.800 thanks so please take your seats we're
02:55:09.279 going to finish at three so the sooner
02:55:11.960 we start the soon more chance we'll have
02:55:14.040 to talk about various questions you may
02:55:17.080 have I just just like to follow
02:55:19.920 on however with
02:55:22.160 that
02:55:24.920 uh film we showed just before we left
02:55:29.000 for lunch
02:55:30.760 because
02:55:32.560 uh it says
02:55:34.920 something about
02:55:37.760 Berkshire uh there are you know all
02:55:42.560 kinds
02:55:43.600 of public companies and Wealthy public
02:55:46.600 companies and
02:55:48.760 uh throughout
02:55:51.560 America
02:55:53.319 and there are
02:55:55.680 certainly
02:55:57.479 cases where in one
02:56:01.040 family uh somebody has made a
02:56:04.960 very large amount of money and is
02:56:09.560 devoting it to philanthropy or much of
02:56:12.840 it the philanthropy such as the Walton
02:56:14.720 family would be the number one thing in
02:56:17.479 in in in uh uh in Walmart and
02:56:23.439 certainly Bill did the same thing at
02:56:26.520 Bill Gates did the same thing at
02:56:29.560 Microsoft but what is unusual about
02:56:32.880 Burkshire is that a very significant
02:56:37.479 number of Brookshire
02:56:40.080 shareholders located all over the United
02:56:42.560 States not just in
02:56:44.239 Oma but the number of different bir
02:56:48.560 shareh holders who
02:56:51.120 have contributed a hundred million
02:56:54.000 dollar or
02:56:55.200 more to their local charities usually
02:56:58.160 with people not knowing about
02:57:01.359 it uh I think is many multiples of any
02:57:06.200 other public company in in the country
02:57:08.800 it's not not M more multiples than than
02:57:12.720 you know Bill's put a whole lot into
02:57:16.359 philanthropy and
02:57:21.439 uh and I don't I don't know the details
02:57:24.399 of the family but but clearly there's a
02:57:26.800 huge sum of money that that uh the
02:57:30.800 Walmart
02:57:32.200 family uh I'm sure has done all kinds of
02:57:35.000 things philanthropic and we'll continue
02:57:37.319 to do it but I don't think you'll
02:57:41.600 find any company where a group of
02:57:45.239 shareholders who aren't related to each
02:57:47.319 other
02:57:48.840 so many of
02:57:50.120 them have done something along the lines
02:57:55.239 of what Ruth
02:57:58.160 did a few weeks
02:58:00.600 ago just
02:58:02.720 to exchange a little piece of paper that
02:58:06.840 they've held
02:58:08.040 for five decades and they've lived well
02:58:11.359 themselves they haven't deny their
02:58:12.840 family
02:58:14.200 anything uh but they don't
02:58:18.760 feel that they have to create a dynasty
02:58:20.920 or anything and they give it back to
02:58:23.399 society and a great many do it of an
02:58:26.040 anonymously they do it in many states to
02:58:29.040 some extent we see a little some
02:58:30.960 concentration of it in Nebraska
02:58:34.160 because uh
02:58:37.120 generally uh when you when you're giving
02:58:40.200 away a lot of money they they call it in
02:58:42.319 the philanthropic World they call it
02:58:44.080 absorption capacity and Truth this is
02:58:48.200 very it's very hard to give away a
02:58:50.080 billion dollars to $10 at a time to
02:58:53.120 people who are needy or something of the
02:58:55.040 sort and so large institutions have this
02:58:58.359 absorption capacity which tend to be
02:59:00.640 universities or colleges or that sort of
02:59:03.279 thing and some philanthropies are much
02:59:06.040 more imaginative than others but the one
02:59:10.560 thing I've
02:59:12.560 never well most of them want to do it
02:59:15.840 anonymously so I can't tell there's
02:59:18.359 specific
02:59:19.680 stories but I have to say one thing that
02:59:22.399 was astounding is that that the same day
02:59:25.960 we bought a billion dollars worth of
02:59:30.319 Berkshire class A stock from Ruth so
02:59:33.840 that and I guess we were actually buying
02:59:36.560 it from the the school at that point
02:59:41.359 because you just given them the and then
02:59:43.520 so the transaction was them was with
02:59:46.319 them but Mark Bard in our office bought
02:59:51.000 a billion dollars from them but he also
02:59:53.040 bought $500 million worth
02:59:56.439 of stock from somebody else that nobody
03:00:00.160 will ever have heard of and in a
03:00:03.279 different state and and I won't
03:00:06.239 elaborate beyond that but we have
03:00:09.960 had a very significant number of people
03:00:14.319 and there's more to come uh and
03:00:17.239 obviously they had to be people that
03:00:19.640 came in early or their parents did or
03:00:22.080 their grandparents did but they've all
03:00:24.399 lived good lives they haven't denied
03:00:27.200 themselves anything I mean you know they
03:00:29.680 have second homes and they but
03:00:32.439 they they
03:00:34.720 generally uh in fact I would say the
03:00:38.680 almost
03:00:39.800 universally they people knew them in the
03:00:43.040 community everything but they they've uh
03:00:46.560 they've used
03:00:48.640 what they accomp what they saved they
03:00:51.000 denied themselves consumption themselves
03:00:53.560 that's what savings are is is
03:00:56.399 consumption
03:00:57.840 deferred uh and uh they've uh they've
03:01:03.840 given uh they financed everything all
03:01:07.640 over the country and usually they like
03:01:10.080 to do it anonymously I I outed my sister
03:01:14.080 when I wrote about her in the annual
03:01:15.880 report but but uh uh Bird's here today
03:01:19.479 and uh
03:01:22.520 uh I told her she should wear a t-shirt
03:01:25.080 or something said no solicitors allowed
03:01:27.239 or something that but they uh but they
03:01:30.520 just do it and uh it's really a uh both
03:01:37.560 Charlie and I felt it's
03:01:40.479 really uh it's really fun to work for a
03:01:45.040 group of people like that rather than
03:01:47.000 for index funds or for for uh hedge
03:01:51.319 funds or whatever it may be I mean that
03:01:53.520 the you're just seeing what
03:01:55.760 people
03:01:57.399 actually it sort of rest restores your
03:02:02.279 uh your faith in humanity that people
03:02:04.640 defer their own consumption within a
03:02:07.000 family for decades and
03:02:09.640 decades and then they could do something
03:02:11.960 like and they will uh I think it may end
03:02:16.120 up being 150
03:02:18.520 people to pursue different lives and tal
03:02:21.840 the people and diverse
03:02:23.800 people uh to become a dream of being a a
03:02:29.000 doctor and uh and not have to incur
03:02:32.479 incredible death to do it or whatever
03:02:34.279 may be the case there's a million
03:02:36.000 different examples and I want you to
03:02:38.960 know that uh that
03:02:43.239 uh you're
03:02:45.160 very you're very
03:02:50.399 uh well you're a unique actually group
03:02:53.760 of of shareholders among public
03:02:56.160 companies as far as I know in terms of
03:03:00.239 the way you've
03:03:01.560 deferred your own consumption while
03:03:04.120 living fine to help other people and and
03:03:07.800 it you know it takes a lot of years but
03:03:11.239 it can really amount to something very
03:03:13.000 substantial and what Ruth did was uh
03:03:18.880 you know at roughly my age
03:03:23.200 she looked
03:03:25.600 at a little piece of paper which
03:03:29.239 actually was a claim check on the output
03:03:32.399 of others in the future and she said
03:03:35.239 instead of the output
03:03:37.080 being uh for her that the output would
03:03:40.279 be for a continuing
03:03:42.960 stream of
03:03:45.200 people for decades of decades and
03:03:48.520 decades to come that we're having a
03:03:51.000 different life in the pursuit of being
03:03:53.880 becoming doctors than than they
03:03:56.000 otherwise would have and and Berkshire
03:04:00.080 has been of
03:04:02.319 course her husband Sandy contributed
03:04:05.439 substantially to
03:04:06.920 berkshire's berkshire's
03:04:09.640 record uh Sandy was a wonderful partner
03:04:12.600 to have so he it was both input by him
03:04:17.520 and and then there was deferred
03:04:20.080 consumption by his family and then there
03:04:22.560 was ultimately this final gift to Albert
03:04:26.920 Einstein and like I said the same day uh
03:04:31.040 there was only 500 million it will go to
03:04:33.160 in a different way but it's happening
03:04:37.239 all over and I don't think any any
03:04:39.560 companies like that so I just want to
03:04:42.160 tell you that it's inspiring to work for
03:04:44.560 grou of showers
03:04:53.080 and Becky go to it all right the next
03:04:56.319 question comes from slavin VAB brat um
03:05:00.040 as CEO will Mr AEL be in charge of the
03:05:02.680 portfolio of Common Stocks that Mr
03:05:04.760 Buffett has been managing or will this
03:05:06.680 function be exercised by Mr combms and
03:05:09.200 Mr wesler as investing could be defined
03:05:12.080 as the discipline of relative selection
03:05:14.080 can major Capital allocation decisions
03:05:16.200 such as large acquisitions be separated
03:05:18.479 from the common stock selection
03:05:20.520 process yeah I would say that decision
03:05:23.920 actually will be made when I'm not
03:05:26.000 around and uh I may try and come back
03:05:29.560 and haunt them if they do it differently
03:05:31.800 then but I'm not sure the Ouija board or
03:05:35.520 they will get that job done so that job
03:05:38.080 I'll I'll never know the answer on
03:05:39.560 whether I get covered but I feel very
03:05:41.399 comfortable about the fact that it will
03:05:44.479 be made
03:05:45.600 by uh a board
03:05:48.720 that they've got loads of brain power
03:05:51.319 they got a dedication to a to an unusual
03:05:56.319 institution uh and uh they they will
03:06:01.200 figure things out but I would I would
03:06:03.080 say that if I were on that
03:06:05.520 board uh and were making the decision I
03:06:10.239 would
03:06:11.399 probably knowing
03:06:13.560 Greg uh I would I I would just leave uh
03:06:18.439 I I would leave the capital allocation
03:06:21.760 to to Greg and uh uh he
03:06:27.359 understands
03:06:29.359 businesses extremely well and if you
03:06:32.800 understand
03:06:33.640 businesses you understand you understand
03:06:36.960 Common Stocks I mean if if you really
03:06:39.200 know how business works you
03:06:42.439 are uh you are an investment manager
03:06:46.399 what how much you manage
03:06:48.640 maybe just your own funds or maybe other
03:06:51.319 people and if you really are primarily
03:06:55.600 interested in in getting assets under
03:06:59.399 management which is where the money is
03:07:01.920 you know you don't really have to
03:07:03.520 understand that sort of thing but but
03:07:06.120 that's not the case with Ted or Todd
03:07:08.720 obviously but I think the responsibility
03:07:12.120 ought to be
03:07:13.520 entirely uh with Greg that's uh the
03:07:17.880 responsibility with has been with me and
03:07:19.960 I farmed out some of it and I used to
03:07:22.040 think differently about how that would
03:07:24.279 be handled but I I think the
03:07:26.600 responsibility should be that of the CEO
03:07:28.840 and whatever that CEO decides may be
03:07:32.920 helpful in in in effectuating that
03:07:38.760 responsibility uh you know that that's
03:07:42.200 that's up to Amber herds decide at the
03:07:45.359 time they're running the money but uh
03:07:48.040 uh so I would say that my thinking on
03:07:50.120 that has has developed to some extent as
03:07:54.080 the sums have grown so large at
03:07:56.600 Bard uh and we do not want to try and
03:08:00.479 have uh you know 200 people around that
03:08:04.560 are managing a billion each it just
03:08:06.200 doesn't work uh and uh uh I think that
03:08:11.880 when you're handling the sums that we
03:08:13.479 will have you've got to think
03:08:15.800 very strategic about how to do very big
03:08:19.920 things uh and I think Greg is capable of
03:08:23.560 doing that I
03:08:24.600 think I've missed a lot of stuff in the
03:08:27.479 past uh so I'm actually wiser about
03:08:31.120 doing that now uh
03:08:35.880 but I uh you know I would do it better
03:08:40.279 this time around than 2008 n if
03:08:42.720 something akin to that happened but uh
03:08:46.640 it won't be exactly like 2008 or nine
03:08:49.600 you can be sure of that but you also can
03:08:51.800 say that there will be times when uh
03:08:55.479 having huge sums
03:08:58.080 available extremely quickly maybe it'll
03:09:00.439 be once every 5 years maybe it probably
03:09:02.479 be more like once every 10 years or
03:09:04.239 something but the way as the world gets
03:09:06.840 more sophisticated
03:09:09.359 complicated and
03:09:11.760 intertwined uh more can go wrong and uh
03:09:17.000 uh
03:09:18.239 and there's no
03:09:20.840 sense going through here exploring the
03:09:23.520 possibilities of the different things
03:09:24.720 that could happen but you we do do want
03:09:27.120 to be able to act when it happens and I
03:09:29.479 think the chief executive should some be
03:09:32.080 somebody that can weigh buying
03:09:33.880 businesses buying stocks doing all kinds
03:09:36.800 of things that might come up at a time
03:09:40.000 when nobody else is willing to uh move
03:09:43.880 it wasn't that people didn't have money
03:09:45.399 in 2008 it's it's that they were they
03:09:48.160 were paralyzed and uh and we did have
03:09:52.040 the advantage of having some capital and
03:09:55.960 and a willingness
03:09:57.800 to uh an eagerness even to
03:10:01.319 act uh and a government that that in
03:10:05.800 effect looked at as us as an asset
03:10:08.399 instead of a liability and I think that
03:10:11.840 all of those qualities will
03:10:15.640 be even more
03:10:18.080 important uh as our Capital pile grows
03:10:21.680 and so I think uh Greg may have have a
03:10:25.319 even more fun than I had uh in in a
03:10:29.080 period
03:10:30.200 when uh extraordinary things were
03:10:33.720 happening and and we were the logical
03:10:35.960 place to
03:10:37.200 go um it uh you never know whether it'll
03:10:41.960 be next week next year next decade but
03:10:45.800 you won't be you know it won't be a
03:10:48.160 century from now that is for sure uh and
03:10:52.840 uh
03:10:56.160 uh the
03:10:57.920 more
03:11:00.120 intertwined and
03:11:02.520 sophisticated the world financial
03:11:04.560 situation gets the more vulnerable it
03:11:06.439 gets in a certain sense it it solves a
03:11:09.479 lot of small problems but it leaves it
03:11:11.680 more vulnerable to large
03:11:15.720 problems Greg Des bother at all or
03:11:20.680 not with without uh directly answering
03:11:23.720 the question I think there's one
03:11:25.120 important thing is I think as we go
03:11:28.040 through any transition it's important to
03:11:29.840 know that the capital allocation
03:11:32.319 principles that burer lives by today
03:11:35.160 will continue to survive warranted and I
03:11:37.279 think that's what the thing I'd want to
03:11:39.720 communicate that will we have our
03:11:41.600 operating businesses Insurance non
03:11:43.399 Insurance we're going to cap we'll
03:11:45.520 provide them the capital necessary to be
03:11:47.479 successful and grow if it's appropriate
03:11:50.200 um at the same time expecting a return
03:11:52.680 of capital from them when they have
03:11:54.279 excess cash and then as we've discussed
03:11:57.560 or you've touched on uh always looking
03:12:01.439 at potentially new businesses as a whole
03:12:04.120 or in a piece and as you've always
03:12:06.200 highlighted and I fully agree it's a
03:12:08.439 we're we'll always look at equities as
03:12:10.279 we're investing in a business either 1%
03:12:12.920 or 100% but we're looking at the
03:12:16.319 business we're looking at the economic
03:12:18.920 prospects of that business and how
03:12:21.359 sustainable it is and what it will look
03:12:24.040 like 10 years from now and is our the
03:12:27.479 capital we originally put in at
03:12:30.040 exponential risk or or where where's
03:12:32.439 that risk sit that profile and then of
03:12:35.319 course um and then we'll obviously have
03:12:38.520 our our our our continue to always put
03:12:41.960 excess cash in the safest investment
03:12:43.920 there is in in US treasuries knowing we
03:12:46.560 want to Main maintain that Fortress of a
03:12:48.439 balance sheet for two reasons one to act
03:12:51.040 but also to always protect our
03:12:52.720 shareholders if we have a we want to
03:12:55.200 maintain the position Berkshire is in
03:12:57.840 now uh realistically for the to Ure it
03:13:01.680 uh to ensure it
03:13:03.279 inures well when he says that it makes
03:13:05.720 me wish I'd stayed around to be number
03:13:07.760 two instead of number one in this
03:13:09.800 process over the years it it's it's uh
03:13:13.560 you know it it doesn't get more fun than
03:13:16.319 what we what we we're doing and and and
03:13:18.560 uh and we're better positioned than ever
03:13:21.520 before we're not positioned though
03:13:23.239 however to earn extraordinary Returns
03:13:26.160 versus what American Business generally
03:13:29.439 earns it uh as I'm you know I would I
03:13:33.279 would hope we could be slightly better
03:13:35.560 but nobody's going to be
03:13:38.720 dramatically better in some and you know
03:13:43.040 over the next Century it gets very hard
03:13:45.080 to it gets very hard to predict who the
03:13:48.439 winner will be and and if you look back
03:13:51.239 as we did a few meetings ago as the the
03:13:55.080 top 20 companies in the world at at 10e
03:14:00.800 intervals uh you realize the game isn't
03:14:04.000 quite as easy as as it looks but getting
03:14:08.399 a decent result actually is reasonably
03:14:12.880 should be reasonably easy if you just
03:14:17.160 don't get talked out of doing what has
03:14:19.600 works in the past and don't get carried
03:14:21.359 away with fads and don't don't listen to
03:14:23.880 people who have different
03:14:25.520 interests in in uh mind and the the
03:14:29.160 interest of our
03:14:30.560 sholders okay we'll go to station number
03:14:37.760 one hello Mr Buffett my name is Tomo I'm
03:14:42.319 from D Germany um this is my first time
03:14:46.760 out here in omahas so thank you for
03:14:50.080 having us here today so my question is
03:14:52.960 directed to you Mr Buffett and Mr AEL in
03:14:57.160 2019 you reportedly made a bit for the
03:15:01.239 it distribution business Tech data and
03:15:04.920 commented that you understand its role
03:15:07.160 as a
03:15:08.399 middleman I wonder if you could kindly
03:15:10.640 elaborate on the
03:15:12.439 criteria you look at when evaluating it
03:15:15.680 distribution businesses like dat data
03:15:18.399 and their competitive position thank you
03:15:22.359 well we had some experience with
03:15:24.479 distribution businesses and we
03:15:26.720 know uh their potential who would agree
03:15:30.040 in their limitations
03:15:32.199 and uh Greg you were involved in that
03:15:34.880 more than I was so that I mean that was
03:15:37.199 a case where uh there had been a bit
03:15:40.960 made and there was a go shop provision
03:15:43.520 and uh I think the management probably
03:15:46.080 would have preferred that we buy it and
03:15:48.800 and when we went in with a better
03:15:50.720 bid uh the original party raised their
03:15:53.880 bid and and we never make the same offer
03:15:56.680 twice so Greg tell them about yeah so uh
03:16:01.560 absolutely in 2019 we saw Tech data as a
03:16:04.319 unique opportunity when we saw the other
03:16:06.880 bid and and the underlying value of that
03:16:09.720 distribution business we did waren waren
03:16:12.840 and I were talking others made the
03:16:14.399 conclusion we should talk to management
03:16:16.680 we talked to the team they were very
03:16:18.640 interested in uh Berkshire being their
03:16:21.120 long-term owner uh and we still saw good
03:16:24.520 value in the in the opportunity and we
03:16:27.560 had a good understanding of distribution
03:16:29.680 businesses we have TTI it's not exactly
03:16:34.560 um identical to Tech dat in that they're
03:16:36.880 very specific to the who their customers
03:16:39.880 are and who they serve and supply and
03:16:43.239 who they purchase from because on the
03:16:44.960 distribution side it's important to have
03:16:47.439 that input coming in from from folks who
03:16:51.399 want their product and you know it's
03:16:53.000 needed on the other side that there's
03:16:54.560 demand for it and they had a they had an
03:16:56.319 excellent model uh if you think of TTI
03:17:00.800 for example that Warren talked about
03:17:03.120 Paul many times and the person who
03:17:04.840 founded this business but but it's a
03:17:07.399 unique business in that uh our revenues
03:17:10.479 on that business is approximately $10
03:17:15.000 billion the average part they sell is a
03:17:18.680 little over 9 cents 95 billion Parts go
03:17:22.680 through their
03:17:23.680 warehouse every every year uh but it's a
03:17:28.080 model that if you have the right people
03:17:30.040 on both sides of the equation and you
03:17:32.239 understand that well there's there's a
03:17:34.199 unique opportunity there and and that is
03:17:37.680 something um we saw in in Tech data and
03:17:41.520 and as Warren highlighted we made our
03:17:43.359 bid unfortunately it was then taught by
03:17:46.040 the original bidder and we uh moved on
03:17:48.880 but we uh we thought very highly of it
03:17:51.239 yeah we we've probably seen at least
03:17:53.080 five of them uh in aggregate that over
03:17:57.800 the last three or four or five years uh
03:18:01.120 it's not a business that you can dream
03:18:03.000 about because uh uh it's a it's a decent
03:18:07.359 business but uh for example many of the
03:18:11.800 items that the manufacturer just they
03:18:14.239 don't want to tie up their Capital you
03:18:15.800 tie up if you have you know a million
03:18:20.960 plus skus they the stocking un it's like
03:18:24.760 selling jelly beans or something like
03:18:26.399 that and then then and you do you're
03:18:30.479 serving a
03:18:32.439 purpose to a
03:18:34.560 degree but you don't you don't really it
03:18:39.040 isn't your product in in in effect of
03:18:42.040 yeah I mean you're you're just a good
03:18:43.840 system for the producer of the equ
03:18:47.359 to get it to the to the end user U
03:18:51.880 without tying up a lot of capital being
03:18:54.160 in a business they don't want to be in
03:18:56.000 and so we we we understand we we we we
03:19:00.439 but there's no magic to it there was a
03:19:03.880 with with TTI you had a
03:19:06.960 marvelous man running things and and and
03:19:09.920 he you know and he's and he he
03:19:14.239 uh he
03:19:16.880 when you get a marvelous person running
03:19:18.479 something to some extent that's thex for
03:19:22.199 for better people underneath Greg and I
03:19:25.520 went to Paul Andrews Andrews funeral
03:19:28.960 what few years ago and there were 300
03:19:32.840 people or so there and there wasn't one
03:19:37.040 person that had to say
03:19:41.279 something particularly nice but
03:19:43.640 stretched a little bit about about the
03:19:46.199 decas I mean everybody Paul Andrews was
03:19:49.399 The Real McCoy and he was he was an
03:19:51.319 amazing man and he behaved
03:19:54.439 wonderfully with Burkshire I mean he
03:19:56.800 wanted to do more for birkshire than
03:19:58.479 Burkshire would do for him I mean it was
03:20:00.239 very s and you run into those people as
03:20:04.800 I say you run into people that bend over
03:20:06.520 backwards forest and then some bend over
03:20:09.120 forwards but that's just the way it is
03:20:11.560 in this world uh and we've had we've had
03:20:16.000 quite a few that been over backwards of
03:20:17.640 course and uh the distribution business
03:20:23.120 is not a wonderful business but it is a
03:20:25.760 business and it's a business that that
03:20:28.439 if it's big enough it's one we would
03:20:31.479 look at and we would buy additional and
03:20:34.239 TTI makes some smaller Acquisitions on
03:20:36.720 its own all the time I don't even I
03:20:39.680 don't even hear about them until I read
03:20:41.239 the quarterly reports and so we we we
03:20:45.439 want to build up
03:20:47.840 we want to build our businesses in every
03:20:49.640 area that we operate and we've got
03:20:51.239 unlimited Capital to do it so so we
03:20:55.399 we're we're willing to have small
03:20:56.920 Acquisitions take place if they fit in
03:20:59.520 with something we already have but we're
03:21:01.960 not in the business of going out after
03:21:03.720 small Acquisitions and if we did we
03:21:07.080 would we just don't have the people for
03:21:09.359 it and it wouldn't move the needle
03:21:11.520 anyway at burshire so
03:21:14.680 uh we mayor
03:21:17.800 we we would we would have been happy
03:21:20.000 doing uh the deal that the questioner
03:21:23.520 asked about but if we don't do it you
03:21:26.399 know it just doesn't make that much
03:21:28.040 difference we want to do it if we do it
03:21:30.359 we'll do it well we'll do it right
03:21:31.880 they'll made the right decision if they
03:21:34.399 don't uh you know we will find something
03:21:37.680 else to do with the
03:21:38.880 money in the end and and we can always
03:21:42.080 buy a little more of TTI for you the
03:21:44.800 shareholders by just buying in our Stu
03:21:46.600 talk too MH exactly
03:21:49.359 yeah
03:21:51.960 okay let's see we need Becky next don't
03:21:54.520 we yeah Becky all right Warren earlier
03:21:57.239 you you talked about selling some of the
03:21:59.920 Apple uh shares in order to build up
03:22:02.319 your cash Supply and I think it's had a
03:22:05.040 lot of people wondering what where you
03:22:06.720 see opportunities or what might be
03:22:08.520 coming or Market valuation so I'll ask
03:22:10.960 this question from Foster Taylor at the
03:22:13.880 1999 annual meeting you mentioned that
03:22:16.160 if you own owned all of America's 500
03:22:18.120 businesses you would be making $334
03:22:20.800 billion while paying 10.5 trillion doar
03:22:24.520 you emphasize that this was not a good
03:22:26.399 return on investment today by my math
03:22:29.279 the S&P 500 has a market capitalization
03:22:31.439 of around 44 trillion with profits of
03:22:33.720 around 1.45 trillion this is a very
03:22:36.239 similar return on investment to the 1999
03:22:39.199 levels do you see similarities in the
03:22:41.520 market today and the 1999 levels well
03:22:44.800 one thing has changed dramatically from
03:22:47.760 uh well from
03:22:50.760 1990 I'm a on the 1999 but
03:22:55.640 uh there have been
03:22:58.319 times in my life that I've been a
03:23:01.800 washing so many opportunities that I
03:23:04.640 could have invested everything by
03:23:06.279 Nightfall and then there's other times
03:23:08.319 when the year goes well not in the early
03:23:10.720 days but now
03:23:13.640 uh we we just we haven't seen anything
03:23:17.120 that makes sense that's that moves the
03:23:19.800 needle now we've made
03:23:21.960 small Acquisitions during the year our
03:23:24.359 companies have made Acquisitions and and
03:23:28.399 we you know Greg and I may talk about
03:23:31.479 something that
03:23:32.520 involves a $300 million purchase or
03:23:35.520 something like that and you know it if
03:23:38.479 if it fits well enough we do it
03:23:40.800 but uh and if our managers see things
03:23:44.600 that fit them
03:23:47.199 we want to look at them because our
03:23:48.720 managers do not have necessarily the
03:23:50.720 same equations in mind that we do but
03:23:52.880 there's some managers which we would
03:23:54.439 hand a uh give just say you know
03:23:57.640 whatever you decide to do and then
03:23:59.080 there's other managers that wouldn't
03:24:00.960 that would not know how to allocate
03:24:02.640 Capital particularly and that they don't
03:24:06.239 have to be able to be great Capital
03:24:08.720 allocators if they happen to be great at
03:24:10.560 serving customers and understand their
03:24:12.399 own industry and all of that you know
03:24:15.080 they can be great managers and a good
03:24:17.840 many of them are capital allocators and
03:24:20.279 others are but the
03:24:24.760 uh this is not this is not a time when
03:24:30.000 when uh the phone is going to be ringing
03:24:32.720 often but there are times from and gr
03:24:37.120 will know how to handle them as well are
03:24:38.960 better than than uh I have over time and
03:24:43.359 Charlie and I would you know
03:24:46.920 we we missed a lot of things and uh what
03:24:50.800 we really regretted was missing
03:24:52.960 something
03:24:53.920 that you're not be very big we never we
03:24:56.720 never worried about missing something we
03:24:58.319 didn't understand I mean why why should
03:25:01.479 we be be able to you know predict the
03:25:05.199 future of every business anymore than we
03:25:07.040 can predict you know what what wheat
03:25:09.680 yelds are like to be in Illinois next
03:25:12.199 year well not Wheaten Illinois Wheaten
03:25:14.520 Kansas but corn Illinois
03:25:17.319 uh so
03:25:20.520 uh I I wouldn't I don't really think of
03:25:23.720 whether it's similar in 1999 because I'm
03:25:26.479 not that good on chronology anyway
03:25:28.239 unless something really dramatic
03:25:30.840 happened at the time I mean I remember
03:25:34.359 things from 2008 and N better much
03:25:38.399 better than I remember whether something
03:25:40.640 happened in 2015 or or 1987 or well 198
03:25:46.319 7 I remember because of October 19th but
03:25:50.080 but uh uh I'm I'm I just don't think I
03:25:55.720 don't think that way I just look at what
03:25:57.040 I can do every
03:25:58.399 day
03:26:00.880 great um I'm going to have to use it
03:26:04.040 nothing sorry nothing to add okay well
03:26:06.479 we'll go to station
03:26:09.880 two I
03:26:13.199 mean it's nice to know what lines you
03:26:15.479 can get an Applause
03:26:16.790 [Laughter]
03:26:23.600 for station
03:26:26.359 two hello my name is Stefan WB I am a
03:26:31.160 shareholder from Hur Hur Germany I've
03:26:34.800 been coming to Omaha since
03:26:37.800 2007 and I'm deeply grateful for all the
03:26:41.199 things I could learn here both about
03:26:43.160 investing and about life in particular
03:26:46.760 creating circumstances that will enable
03:26:49.199 me to lead a productive life during my
03:26:52.920 entire healthy
03:26:55.080 lifespan so thank you for that my
03:26:59.760 question my question to Warren your
03:27:02.720 favorite holding period is forever
03:27:06.479 holding American Express or Coca-Cola
03:27:10.239 for decades Burkshire recently went in
03:27:13.720 and out of marel and you uh I believe
03:27:17.160 sold and later bought oxy which I think
03:27:21.239 happens to everyone all the time um but
03:27:24.520 can you maybe to us give examples of
03:27:28.040 your thought process when you exit
03:27:32.600 positions thank you well there various
03:27:35.880 reasons for exiting positions one is if
03:27:38.160 you need the money but that doesn't
03:27:39.520 happen very often with us but it used to
03:27:42.319 happen on every decision I made when I
03:27:44.239 started when I was 20 years old
03:27:47.359 uh which I considered the postr period
03:27:51.040 uh uh although I actually started in
03:27:53.439 1940 to if you just talk about buying
03:27:56.279 stocks but in any event uh
03:28:01.399 the
03:28:03.359 the uh
03:28:06.479 decision
03:28:08.720 process uh is is really quite
03:28:11.840 interesting in a certain way because it
03:28:16.640 it we we made Charlie and I made
03:28:19.399 decisions extremely
03:28:21.800 fast but in effect after years of
03:28:25.319 thinking about the parameters that that
03:28:29.120 that would enable us to make the quick
03:28:31.680 decision when the when it presented
03:28:34.279 itself and
03:28:36.920 uh people have
03:28:39.520 speculated
03:28:41.080 on how
03:28:42.960 I've decided to really put a lot of
03:28:45.720 money into apple
03:28:48.640 and for a
03:28:51.399 reason I can't one one one thing that
03:28:54.359 Charlie and I both learned a lot about
03:28:56.840 was consumer behavior that didn't mean
03:28:59.560 we thought we could run a a furniture
03:29:02.560 store or anything else but we we did
03:29:05.600 learn a
03:29:07.640 lot when we bought a a Furniture chain
03:29:11.640 in Baltimore and we quickly real
03:29:15.239 realized
03:29:16.840 that it was a mistake but having made
03:29:20.040 that mistake made us smarter about
03:29:22.560 actually thinking through what the
03:29:25.319 capital allocation process would be and
03:29:27.760 how people were likely to be behave in
03:29:29.720 the future with department stores and
03:29:31.439 all kinds of things that we wouldn't
03:29:33.199 really focused
03:29:34.640 on so we learned something about
03:29:36.800 consumer behavior from that we didn't
03:29:39.199 learn how to run a department store now
03:29:42.720 the next one was Sees Candy and C's
03:29:45.479 candy
03:29:46.960 was also a study of consumer Behavior we
03:29:49.760 didn't know how to make candy you know
03:29:51.960 we didn't there were all kinds of things
03:29:53.760 we didn't know uh but we've learned more
03:29:58.640 about consumer Behavior as we go along
03:30:02.359 and
03:30:04.520 that sort of background in a very
03:30:08.120 general way led up to the study of
03:30:13.120 consumer behavior in terms of apples
03:30:16.160 products and in that
03:30:19.560 case while I watched what was happening
03:30:22.479 at the furniture mark in terms of people
03:30:25.560 leaving the store even though we were
03:30:27.920 selling Apple at Price where we weren't
03:30:30.560 even making any money but it was just so
03:30:32.760 popular that uh if we didn't have it uh
03:30:36.880 people left the store and went to Best
03:30:38.359 Buy or someplace and and if you know the
03:30:40.840 bumkins they can't stand anybody leaving
03:30:42.720 the store so you they behave accordingly
03:30:44.720 but then you learned
03:30:46.960 you you that had the interest in the
03:30:49.680 brand and then you had the a million
03:30:53.000 different
03:30:54.000 inputs
03:30:55.560 but I think the psychologist call this
03:30:58.479 apperceptive Mass but there is something
03:31:02.319 that comes along that takes a whole
03:31:04.080 bunch of observations that you made and
03:31:06.239 knowledge you have and then
03:31:09.800 crystallizes uh your
03:31:12.640 thinking into action big action in the
03:31:15.920 the case of apple and there actually is
03:31:19.680 something which which I mean it
03:31:22.439 mysterious but I really can't talk about
03:31:24.960 but it was it was perfectly legal
03:31:26.880 everything I'm sure you that but it it
03:31:29.279 just happened to be something that
03:31:31.239 entered the picture that uh took all the
03:31:35.439 other
03:31:36.439 observations and and I guess my mind
03:31:39.640 reach what they call a perceptive mask
03:31:41.840 which I really don't know anything about
03:31:43.279 but I but I've uh I I know the
03:31:46.720 phenomenon when I when I when I
03:31:48.439 experience it and uh uh you know that
03:31:54.120 is we saw we
03:31:56.560 saw something that I felt
03:32:00.319 was well enormously underpriced maybe
03:32:03.080 I've used this example before but if you
03:32:05.560 talk to most people if they have an
03:32:08.199 iPhone and they have a second car the
03:32:11.560 second car cost some 30 or $35,000 and
03:32:14.439 they were told that they never could
03:32:17.080 have the iPhone again or they could
03:32:19.520 never have the second car again uh uh
03:32:24.160 they would give up the second car but
03:32:25.840 second car cost them 20 times the iPhone
03:32:28.960 did so now people don't think about
03:32:31.359 their purchases that way but but but I
03:32:34.319 think about their behavior and uh so we
03:32:38.520 just decid without knowing I don't know
03:32:41.479 the faint there may be some little guy
03:32:43.279 inside the iPhone or something I I have
03:32:45.399 no idea idea how it works but I also
03:32:47.880 know what it I know what it means to
03:32:49.760 people and I know how they use it and I
03:32:52.120 think I know enough about consumer
03:32:53.960 Behavior to know this one of the great
03:32:56.279 products maybe the greatest product of
03:32:59.359 all time and the value it offers is
03:33:01.880 incredible and I think it has in Tim Tim
03:33:05.040 Cook I think it has somebody
03:33:08.040 that in in his own way is the equivalent
03:33:12.720 of a partner partner with Steve Jobs
03:33:16.560 that could do one thing
03:33:18.760 extraordinarily
03:33:20.520 well and and more than one application
03:33:23.800 but one thing and and and and Tim was
03:33:26.800 the perfect partner to serve
03:33:29.199 sequentially with him so it it's
03:33:34.359 uh you sort of know it when you see it I
03:33:39.000 I actually saw it with Geico when I I
03:33:42.279 went there in 1950 I didn't know exactly
03:33:44.600 what I was seeing
03:33:46.600 but lurmer
03:33:49.000 Davidson on a Saturday in four
03:33:52.319 hours taught me enough about what I
03:33:55.880 understood what auto insurance was and I
03:33:57.760 knew what a car was and I knew what
03:33:59.239 people went through people's minds you I
03:34:01.640 know I knew they didn't like to buy it
03:34:03.840 but I knew they couldn't drive without
03:34:05.439 it so that was pretty interesting and
03:34:08.840 then but he filled in all the blanks in
03:34:10.920 my mind as I sat there on that Saturday
03:34:13.040 afternoon and uh you know every now and
03:34:17.319 then it happens you know why do you have
03:34:21.120 this the person you met you know there
03:34:23.680 all these all these different potential
03:34:26.520 spouses in the in the room and then
03:34:29.160 something happens that you decide that
03:34:31.199 this is the one for you you know I think
03:34:33.760 was it Rogers and Hammerstein that that
03:34:36.720 Some Enchanted Evening wrote about that
03:34:39.439 well our idea of Enchanted Evening is to
03:34:42.080 come up with a business Charlie and me
03:34:44.520 and uh and uh there is an aspect of of
03:34:49.399 uh knowing a whole
03:34:52.520 lot and having a whole lot of
03:34:55.319 experiences and then seeing something
03:34:57.680 that turns on the light bulb and uh uh
03:35:03.359 that will continue to happen and I hope
03:35:05.199 it happens a few times to you but you
03:35:07.520 can't make it happen tomorrow but you
03:35:09.279 can prepare yourself for it happening
03:35:11.120 tomorrow and it will happen sometimes
03:35:14.479 hey Warren he he mentioned oxy which I
03:35:17.199 think is a great example yeah where you
03:35:19.199 made the original decision basically on
03:35:21.560 a a weekend with some thought but as the
03:35:24.080 more you learned about oxy and the um
03:35:28.000 the the asset position they had their
03:35:31.199 their ability to operate in a in a in an
03:35:34.000 exceptional Manner and then a a strong
03:35:36.600 CEO around Capital allocation I think
03:35:39.680 your confidence in which was reflected
03:35:42.120 in continuing to acquire more shares is
03:35:45.000 sort of that type
03:35:46.160 process yeah it it it's it's exactly to
03:35:49.560 the point I mean I just learned more as
03:35:51.279 I went along I learned
03:35:53.279 enough you know I'd never uh I'd heard
03:35:57.080 of accidental petroleum ocidental
03:35:58.760 petroleum happens to to uh been a
03:36:03.080 descendant not a descendant but but a
03:36:05.720 continuation of City service which was
03:36:08.239 the first stock I bought and of course
03:36:12.040 uh I I I knew a lot about the on and gas
03:36:15.800 business but but I didn't know anything
03:36:17.920 about geology and uh uh so I I knew the
03:36:21.920 economics of it I I had a lot of various
03:36:25.640 things stored in my mind about the
03:36:27.760 business but I never I never heard of
03:36:32.120 Vicki
03:36:34.160 until I guess it was a Friday or
03:36:37.040 Saturday and we met on Sunday morning we
03:36:39.040 made a deal but that was one sort of
03:36:41.040 deal and then as time passed all the
03:36:45.640 kinds of different events happened and
03:36:47.960 you know icon came in I mean there
03:36:50.720 million things you couldn't predict at
03:36:52.479 the start and and I formed certain
03:36:56.439 opinions as I went along but
03:36:59.160 then uh
03:37:02.160 a I learned more as I went along and
03:37:05.279 then at at a point when
03:37:08.319 I heard an investor call that bigy was
03:37:13.920 on it it it put things together for me
03:37:17.199 in a way didn't mean I knew I had a sure
03:37:19.199 thing or anything like that I don't know
03:37:20.439 what the price of oil was going to be
03:37:21.800 next year but I knew that it was
03:37:24.520 something to act on so we did and uh
03:37:28.479 we're very happy we did and we still
03:37:30.120 don't know what the price of oil is
03:37:31.399 going to be next year and what he does
03:37:33.399 but but I think it the odds are very
03:37:36.359 good that it was in but not a CCH that
03:37:39.840 it was a good decision and uh you know
03:37:43.359 we've got options to buy
03:37:45.960 more stock and and you know when we get
03:37:49.439 through with it
03:37:52.479 uh we
03:37:54.279 could it could be a
03:37:56.479 worthwhile investment for for Berkshire
03:38:00.160 and and we're in it and we're in it for
03:38:03.000 Keeps and uh there are other things that
03:38:06.520 we own that we aren't in for Keeps but
03:38:09.600 uh oh incidentally I I should just throw
03:38:13.359 this out since there's been speculation
03:38:15.080 on
03:38:16.120 we've
03:38:17.720 sold a I was 100% responsible for the
03:38:21.239 paramont decision I read speculation
03:38:23.279 that that one of either Ted or Todd had
03:38:26.720 some involvement in that no it was 100%
03:38:30.080 my decision and uh we sold it all and we
03:38:34.359 lost quite a bit of money and and uh and
03:38:37.399 that happens in this business too but uh
03:38:41.920 actually owning
03:38:43.560 Paramount um made think even
03:38:47.800 further uh I like to think deeper but I
03:38:52.359 certainly uh thought harder even about
03:38:56.399 about the whole question of what people
03:38:58.960 do with their Leisure Time and and uh
03:39:02.880 you know what the governing principles
03:39:04.680 are of running an
03:39:07.479 entertainment business of any sort
03:39:10.359 whether it's sports or movies or
03:39:13.000 whatever it might be and uh I think I'm
03:39:15.800 smarter now than I
03:39:18.520 was year or two a couple years ago but I
03:39:21.319 also think I'm poor because I acquired
03:39:24.000 the knowledge in the manner I did but uh
03:39:27.359 uh if if I just want to be very clear
03:39:30.760 that that a we lost money on Perma and B
03:39:35.399 you know I did it all by myself
03:39:39.880 folks I don't know whether I've
03:39:41.600 anticipated one of Becky's questions now
03:39:43.640 but we we will uh we will find out let's
03:39:47.160 see now you yeah you're next Becky y uh
03:39:50.920 yes you did anticipate one of the
03:39:52.359 questions um let's go to another one
03:39:54.960 this um this question comes from Vincent
03:39:58.479 James in Munich Germany in the
03:40:01.600 Chairman's letter Warren points out that
03:40:03.560 the profit margins for BNSF have slipped
03:40:06.760 relative to all five other railroads
03:40:09.800 however Warren comments in the letter
03:40:11.840 BNSF carries more freight and spends
03:40:14.319 more on Capital expens expenditures than
03:40:16.040 any of the other five major railroads
03:40:18.399 and has a vast service territory Second
03:40:20.560 To None given the comments from Warren
03:40:22.680 about the clear strengths of BNSF what
03:40:25.359 explains the decline in revenue and
03:40:27.319 profit and in particular the profit
03:40:29.279 margins relative to the other five
03:40:31.319 railroads what are the issues relative
03:40:33.640 to the other railroads and what is being
03:40:35.720 done to address them please be specific
03:40:38.600 okay and I will well how specific we get
03:40:41.720 depends on what uh uh Greg wants to say
03:40:46.239 but Greg
03:40:47.359 is that it's Greg's responsibility it my
03:40:50.680 responsibility for the purchase and for
03:40:53.319 the operation up till Greg took took
03:40:56.960 over but I think I'll let Greg answer
03:40:58.640 that then sure yeah the the the uh
03:41:02.880 Warren touched on it and the comments
03:41:05.640 from the uh as reflected there are are
03:41:09.120 very accurate if you look at uh this
03:41:11.479 quarter's results or
03:41:13.640 our uh last last year's results um they
03:41:18.000 were both uh they're disappointing as
03:41:20.720 shareholders and disappointing in the uh
03:41:23.479 Rel relative to the other class one
03:41:26.239 railroads and as highlighted in the
03:41:28.080 question there's five other class one
03:41:29.840 railroads so it's pretty easy to um um
03:41:34.520 understand how you're performing versus
03:41:36.080 the others and it and there's a lot of
03:41:37.720 other variables but there's some very um
03:41:40.279 simple things to look at when we look at
03:41:43.120 where we've been on uh uh with
03:41:45.840 associated with Burlington I would I
03:41:48.000 would just back up a little bit um
03:41:51.680 because if you go back
03:41:53.560 to uh 2021 the Burlington team and
03:41:57.720 management team and the group we're
03:42:00.040 making excellent progress on a lot of
03:42:01.800 fronts when it comes to our uh operating
03:42:05.080 and both being efficient and effective
03:42:06.880 in how we're operating the
03:42:08.520 railroad and I remember very specific
03:42:11.479 comments from myself in 2022 where I
03:42:14.560 commented that uh that was a year there
03:42:17.080 was all the supply chain issues a lot
03:42:19.239 going on in the west coast ports our
03:42:21.399 trains were backed up in a variety of
03:42:23.800 places and we called that a reset year
03:42:27.000 and I think we did need a reset year on
03:42:29.159 the operational side but as we moved
03:42:32.800 into um
03:42:35.600 23 the business cost level cost
03:42:40.000 structure we didn't reset it to the
03:42:42.359 underlying demand we were seeing uh uh
03:42:45.680 we anticipated more demand and the or
03:42:48.960 and we did not reset our cost structure
03:42:51.920 and the team's working very hard as we
03:42:53.960 speak to to um both reset the cost
03:42:58.159 structure and allocate the cost
03:43:00.520 resources uh where they need to be uh
03:43:04.159 and and when you go through something
03:43:05.800 like that uh what we've recognized as an
03:43:08.800 organization yes the the demand of the
03:43:11.439 rail will will drive a certain amount of
03:43:13.560 the cost but the the r is that the rail
03:43:16.800 industry if you go back many many years
03:43:19.960 it's it's it's flat there's not a lot of
03:43:22.439 growth in the industry there's
03:43:24.640 opportunities to become more efficient
03:43:26.239 effective and our margins can go up but
03:43:28.840 the reality is the demand's going to be
03:43:31.199 flat but it does move within different
03:43:34.640 sectors of the rail it can be in the
03:43:36.680 consumer products it can be in
03:43:38.479 industrial it can be an egg but overall
03:43:41.120 it's generally going to be relatively
03:43:42.720 flat so we need to get our cost ructure
03:43:45.560 right and we need to get it right both
03:43:48.000 for the the coming year but for the long
03:43:50.640 term and that means it's going to be a
03:43:52.560 continuous exercise We Can't Stop we
03:43:55.080 can't say we we've gotten far enough
03:43:57.359 because our competitors and we compete
03:43:59.159 with the other rails but we also do
03:44:01.640 compete with the truck industry we have
03:44:03.720 to have a cost structure allows us to
03:44:06.120 compete both within our rail industry
03:44:08.520 and within the transportation sector as
03:44:10.800 a whole so the team at Burlington's
03:44:13.319 working very hard to address the cost
03:44:15.720 structure uh just like we have in the
03:44:18.040 past I think one thing uh we do
03:44:21.359 recognize when the other railroads have
03:44:23.600 implemented uh Precision scheduled
03:44:26.439 railroading there's other metrics that
03:44:29.239 we have to continue to pay attention to
03:44:32.120 and and challenge ourselves if we're not
03:44:34.439 at their level what are the things that
03:44:35.960 are driving it so we're going to when
03:44:37.960 they ask for specifics I'll give you a
03:44:39.960 few uh we have to look at our Rail Yards
03:44:43.080 and understand how we're how we're
03:44:45.399 managing that we have to look at our
03:44:47.399 locomotive Fleet both the size and how
03:44:49.800 we're utilizing that and challenge
03:44:51.840 ourselves and we have to then go back to
03:44:54.319 how we're using our employee resources
03:44:56.319 and allocating them across the the
03:44:58.600 business so there's a lot to be done
03:45:00.199 there our team's 100% committed to uh uh
03:45:04.840 driving to the right cost structure
03:45:06.720 that's consistent with the underlying
03:45:08.479 demand in the business and uh and then
03:45:12.239 we can't stop there is the is the answer
03:45:14.720 so so a lot to be done but we have a a
03:45:17.399 team that's uh absolutely engaged and
03:45:19.960 committed to it and we'll make uh we're
03:45:22.720 going to U make good progress in the in
03:45:26.279 in this current year at burshire we want
03:45:29.239 everybody to have the idea that there's
03:45:30.800 a lot to be done with every business you
03:45:32.880 know it so I mean it
03:45:35.560 is uh you know
03:45:39.319 we fell Nam py would bu a remark
03:45:43.520 remarkable company in om Building
03:45:46.439 Company really remarkable and there
03:45:50.399 question after everything they did that
03:45:52.479 something that was
03:45:53.840 done particularly well you know digging
03:45:56.479 a tunnel under the East River or
03:45:57.960 something when it said it couldn't be
03:45:59.399 done he would say he would be he was
03:46:01.680 pleased but not satisfied and that is
03:46:04.520 exactly the way we want the attitude to
03:46:07.159 be at Berkshire forever uh Omaha is a
03:46:11.960 railroad town if if President Lincoln in
03:46:15.359 1862 I think it was had decided to pick
03:46:19.239 St Joe or plmouth or any place else to
03:46:23.840 build the Transcontinental Railroad all
03:46:25.800 M would probably be a little town of
03:46:27.319 20,000 or something on the banks of
03:46:29.880 Missouri but but making with Lincoln's
03:46:34.680 desire to make this the uh Eastern
03:46:38.439 Eastern
03:46:39.560 Connection uh make a Transcontinental
03:46:42.800 Railroad almost just took off so it's
03:46:46.439 been it's been R it's been
03:46:49.760 railroading at its
03:46:51.880 base the uh you know and anybody that
03:46:56.159 was interested in financial matters had
03:46:58.359 to think about
03:46:59.439 railroads uh plus they had a certain
03:47:01.760 glamour to him anyway but the
03:47:04.159 interesting thing is that up which is
03:47:07.640 our main
03:47:09.080 competitor uh themselves fell way behind
03:47:14.920 20 or 25 years ago before Jim before Jim
03:47:17.640 young came in and in 2000 whatever it
03:47:22.359 was eight or so I started buying three
03:47:25.560 railroad socks in and uh Union Pacific
03:47:29.640 BNSF and and uh Northfolk um Western I
03:47:34.479 believe I don't know why I wasn't buying
03:47:36.520 CN but in any
03:47:38.439 event
03:47:40.640 uh Jim young had done a marvelous job
03:47:44.399 with
03:47:45.800 being with Union Pacific uh so we we
03:47:49.479 were owned all three stocks but what we
03:47:51.800 did in
03:47:53.680 2019 is we were
03:47:57.040 able well we already own 22% of it but
03:48:00.479 overall those was $35
03:48:02.520 million a billion dollar which was a
03:48:06.040 significant part of our Capital we were
03:48:07.920 able to put it to work in a in a
03:48:11.000 business we
03:48:12.560 liked and we
03:48:15.840 there's certain tax advantages that come
03:48:18.960 in terms of making money in something
03:48:21.760 that's more than 80% own but call it
03:48:24.439 100% own in this case versus making it
03:48:27.279 through stocks so it has a a net benefit
03:48:32.960 to us from making the same amount of
03:48:35.080 money owning one of the other railroads
03:48:38.159 by owning all of the railroads and we
03:48:39.880 got 35 billion
03:48:42.479 out during a recession AR period I think
03:48:46.000 that was the worst quarter the third
03:48:48.159 quarter of 2009 maybe the rails it had
03:48:50.600 for a long time so it's it's worked out
03:48:54.800 actually it's worked out very well but
03:48:56.600 it's because we we were putting out
03:48:59.199 capital in 2008 and9 and if we put put
03:49:03.000 money in anything we'd have made a lot
03:49:05.520 of money but it's more satisfying and
03:49:09.000 it's actually better in certain ways
03:49:12.159 taxwise to make it from something that's
03:49:14.439 out 100% owned and all B bunch of uh you
03:49:17.840 know 5% or 10% owned
03:49:21.520 uh uh businesses were you know as I
03:49:26.040 mentioned in the annual
03:49:28.040 report railroads are absolutely
03:49:30.680 essential to the country that doesn't
03:49:32.120 mean they're on The Cutting Edge of
03:49:33.600 everything they're just essential to the
03:49:35.439 country and uh you know it it uh that's
03:49:40.800 why the government you know I think they
03:49:44.000 took them over one time and they they
03:49:48.760 negotiate what our labor settlements
03:49:51.159 will be and everything and and if you
03:49:53.640 shut down the railroads of the country
03:49:55.399 you you it be would be incredible the
03:49:59.560 effects uh but and it would be
03:50:03.040 impossible to construct now I mean it
03:50:05.880 look at what's happening in California
03:50:08.239 when they're trying to build a line I
03:50:10.680 mean you know everybody's worried about
03:50:13.279 the environmental effect of of every
03:50:16.560 Mile and you know and what'll happen to
03:50:19.239 the various species of birds can you
03:50:21.720 imagine the rail system of the United
03:50:23.520 States being built it it it would it
03:50:26.600 would take decades unless a war was on
03:50:29.640 and the government took over things and
03:50:31.239 just ordered them you can't create it so
03:50:34.239 we love owning uh a business like that
03:50:37.239 it's going to be around 100 years from
03:50:38.680 now won't be the best growth business in
03:50:40.720 the world at all during that period but
03:50:42.960 it'll be essential and
03:50:45.439 and what it earns in its relation to its
03:50:49.199 pit it's it its replacement value is a
03:50:52.520 pit but we'll do fine in terms of what
03:50:55.720 we paid for it and we'll we'll
03:50:58.120 distribute substantial amounts in
03:51:00.479 relation to what we
03:51:02.120 paid uh to Berkshire in a very tax
03:51:05.479 efficient way and uh so
03:51:09.439 it's it's uh when the question is what
03:51:13.120 are the issues to the other
03:51:16.080 railroads uh you know it wouldn't have
03:51:19.439 been the end of the world if at all if
03:51:22.159 we bought the Union Pacific and Jim
03:51:23.840 young had stayed alive to run it for us
03:51:26.600 that would have been great too but but
03:51:28.199 we had the opportunity to to buy BNSF
03:51:31.319 and it's been good for them and it's
03:51:32.680 been good for us and we think it's been
03:51:35.439 it's a very important asset to the
03:51:37.120 country and you know I just hope we can
03:51:39.880 find something in other industries that
03:51:43.279 what makes as much sense is that where
03:51:45.720 we can put a whole bunch of money to to
03:51:48.080 work uh at an advantageous
03:51:50.960 time uh so let's go on
03:51:55.520 to station
03:51:58.600 three is that correct or not yeah yeah
03:52:03.159 yeah
03:52:04.319 okay k k good afternoon Mr Mr AEL my
03:52:10.159 name is s po wo a resident of New
03:52:12.840 Zealand but originally from Thailand
03:52:14.560 land this is my first time in America
03:52:17.359 and the first time attending the meeting
03:52:19.159 the journey was quite rough but it was
03:52:20.960 all worth it though because I can now
03:52:23.600 personally thank you Mr Buffett and the
03:52:26.199 late Charlie manga where he still with
03:52:28.520 us for organizing such a wonderful event
03:52:31.600 and most importantly for being such an
03:52:35.279 exceptional role models and sharing your
03:52:37.760 wisdom with us all these years so thank
03:52:40.319 you well thank you for coming
03:52:46.439 so here's my question for you m m Mr
03:52:49.159 Buffett towards the end of 2018 you
03:52:52.239 mentioned that you guarantee you could
03:52:54.840 make a 50% annual return if you had to
03:52:58.040 start again with under 1 million the
03:53:01.680 question is if tomorrow you woke up in
03:53:04.479 the body of a of of body 20y old Amer
03:53:09.199 body but that's
03:53:13.319 fine and your name was now Warren
03:53:17.399 alakat and you had some money to invest
03:53:20.199 on a full-time basis what method or
03:53:22.800 methods would you use to achieve that
03:53:25.560 return would it involve flipping through
03:53:28.080 20,000 pages of Moody's manual or
03:53:31.159 similar Publications or finding you you
03:53:34.159 know to find s buts or would it be
03:53:36.760 hunting for great companies at a fair
03:53:38.880 prize as Mr mwood or would it be a
03:53:42.000 combination of both with opportunity
03:53:44.040 cost serving as the final Arbiter of
03:53:46.439 which method to use given that your
03:53:48.159 investing opportunity has now broaden
03:53:50.800 significantly thank you C good question
03:53:53.399 I'm glad you came and the uh the answer
03:53:57.920 would be in my particular case it would
03:54:01.040 be going through the 20,000 pages and
03:54:05.279 since we were talking about railroads
03:54:07.760 you know I went through the Moody's
03:54:09.120 Transportation manual a couple of times
03:54:11.319 that was, 1500 or 2,000 Pages or well
03:54:13.760 probably 15
03:54:14.880 pages and I found all kinds of
03:54:17.600 interesting things when I was 50 or when
03:54:19.760 I
03:54:20.520 was uh 20 or 21 and I don't imagine here
03:54:26.560 there's anybody here that knows about
03:54:28.800 the Green Bay and Western railroad
03:54:31.199 company but uh there were hundreds and
03:54:33.399 hundreds of railroad companies and I
03:54:35.040 like to read about every one of them the
03:54:37.359 green band
03:54:38.560 Western uh in those days everybody had a
03:54:41.760 nickname for for railroads I mean that
03:54:44.479 was that was just what Northern Pacific
03:54:46.880 was the Nipper and you know Phoebe Snow
03:54:52.120 was one of them in the East that used to
03:54:54.399 go up to Cornell and uh the green band
03:54:57.800 Western was known as grab baggage and
03:55:01.479 walk and
03:55:03.600 gbnw and they had an they had a bond
03:55:08.040 that was actually the common stock and
03:55:09.840 they had a common stock that was
03:55:11.279 actually a bond and you know you know
03:55:14.680 that that could lead to unusual things
03:55:18.600 but they wouldn't lead to unusual things
03:55:20.479 that would work for you with many
03:55:22.279 millions of dollars but but if you
03:55:25.640 collected a whole bunch of
03:55:27.479 those which I set out to do and actually
03:55:31.080 that's what impressed Charlie when I
03:55:32.560 first met him because I knew all the
03:55:34.399 details of all these little companies on
03:55:36.760 the west coast that he thought I would
03:55:38.279 never have heard of it but I knew about
03:55:40.319 the Los Angeles Athletic Club or
03:55:42.359 whatever it might be and and he thought
03:55:45.800 he was the only one that knew about that
03:55:47.520 and that that that uh that became an
03:55:51.800 instant point of connection so to answer
03:55:55.560 your question uh I would I would I I
03:55:59.399 don't know what the equivalent of
03:56:00.479 Moody's manuals or anything would be now
03:56:02.439 but I would I would try and know
03:56:05.040 everything about everything small and I
03:56:09.040 would find something
03:56:11.040 and with a million dollars you could
03:56:13.279 earn 50% here but you have to be in love
03:56:15.880 with the
03:56:16.960 subject uh you can't just be in love
03:56:19.720 with the money you really got to just
03:56:21.479 find it like a you know essentially like
03:56:25.239 you know people find other things in
03:56:27.120 other fields cuz they just love looking
03:56:29.560 for it to a biologist looks for
03:56:31.760 something because they they want to find
03:56:35.239 something they and that's buil in I I
03:56:38.439 don't know how the human brain works
03:56:39.880 that much and I don't think anybody
03:56:41.640 understands too well how the human brain
03:56:43.080 works but but there's different people
03:56:45.600 that that uh just find it
03:56:49.359 exciting to expand their knowledge in a
03:56:52.000 given area we uh you know I know great
03:56:56.920 bridge players I know great chess
03:56:59.359 players actually uh Kasparov came to Al
03:57:03.279 and met Mrs B I've had the luck of of
03:57:07.479 meeting a lot of people that are
03:57:09.560 unbelievably Smart in their own Arena
03:57:13.600 and do some unbelievably dumb things in
03:57:17.560 other areas so all I know is the human
03:57:20.319 brain is complicated and but it does its
03:57:24.720 best when you find out what your brain
03:57:27.399 is really suited for and then you just
03:57:29.640 uh pound the hell out from that point
03:57:32.319 and that's what I would be doing if I if
03:57:35.800 I had a small amount of money and I
03:57:37.680 wanted to make 50% a year but I also
03:57:40.520 wanted to just play the game and you
03:57:43.520 can't do it if you really if you don't
03:57:45.640 find the the game of Interest whether
03:57:48.120 it's Bridge or whether you know whatever
03:57:49.920 it may be chess or this case finding
03:57:54.120 Securities that are undervalued but it
03:57:56.319 sounds to me like you're on the right
03:57:57.640 track I mean anybody will come all the
03:57:59.239 way to this annual meeting has got
03:58:02.560 something in their mind other than
03:58:03.960 Bridge or chess uh so I'm glad you came
03:58:07.680 and come again next
03:58:09.159 year and now we move
03:58:16.159 Now we move to Becky uh this question
03:58:18.720 comes from Denny Poland a shareholder
03:58:20.760 from
03:58:21.479 Pittsburgh when describing the principal
03:58:23.840 agent problem Mr Munger said that
03:58:26.040 capitalism often works best when the
03:58:28.080 people managing the property also own
03:58:30.120 the property in recent years agents of
03:58:32.840 Pension funds and asset management firms
03:58:34.960 who do not have significant personal
03:58:36.760 ownership stakes in birkshire have
03:58:38.840 forwarded proposals that were not in the
03:58:40.960 economic interest of shareholders what
03:58:43.600 can be done to limit the negative
03:58:45.239 influence of these agents in the decades
03:58:47.159 after you're no longer able to cast
03:58:49.159 significant votes against them well
03:58:51.720 that's that's a very perceptive question
03:58:54.600 and and it's been answered in a
03:58:57.840 temporary manner but but but who knows
03:59:00.760 what the how the situation will develop
03:59:03.040 in the future all I know is that you
03:59:05.319 have a wonderful hand that Burk sure
03:59:07.239 have the way but you have to you have to
03:59:10.040 be able to think your way I mean
03:59:12.720 obviously you have to think your way
03:59:14.199 through political realities and you have
03:59:16.399 to think your way for what will cause
03:59:21.040 you want a you want to be on you you you
03:59:23.800 want to be regarded as an asset to the
03:59:26.239 country because uh you'll find more
03:59:30.600 solutions if you
03:59:32.319 are uh an asset you owe to the country
03:59:35.120 anyway but but beond that you you'll
03:59:37.159 find more solutions and if if you're
03:59:39.279 regarded as evil or or something and
03:59:42.720 worse yet if you deserve it so it it
03:59:45.960 it's it's it's something that's
03:59:48.000 constantly in her
03:59:49.359 mind uh and it needs to be in the mind
03:59:52.120 of the directors and they need to think
03:59:55.479 for themselves on this rather than about
03:59:58.840 a conventional
04:00:00.880 wisdom uh
04:00:03.640 which uh you
04:00:06.800 know in in a sense you don't want to
04:00:09.040 become a cynic about life but almost
04:00:11.960 everybody that approaches you if you
04:00:13.680 have
04:00:14.720 tons of resources is has got some
04:00:17.720 interest in figuring out how to use your
04:00:20.439 resources to their advantage and that's
04:00:23.680 true whether they're in politics or
04:00:25.319 whether they're in Investment Banking or
04:00:27.760 whether they're selling you
04:00:30.319 uh
04:00:31.960 uh well whatever it may be that they're
04:00:34.359 selling I don't want to do any injury to
04:00:37.680 anybody but but uh you know life
04:00:41.159 insurance agents see the advantage of
04:00:43.359 buying life insurance and and investment
04:00:46.840 managers get paid based on assets
04:00:49.800 managed to get interested in selling you
04:00:52.880 their services imagine if everybody in
04:00:56.279 this room were following the investment
04:00:59.600 advice of somebody that said you know
04:01:02.439 for 1% a year I'll tell you how to
04:01:05.359 invest your money and in 1950 when we
04:01:09.920 started in
04:01:11.960 19 65 they would have they would have
04:01:16.199 said well by bursh sure half away and
04:01:19.880 and if they were around now and they
04:01:22.080 still have their 1% deal they'd be
04:01:24.560 collecting $8 billion a year from people
04:01:27.720 who aren't getting any dividends from us
04:01:30.159 so they they would have a different
04:01:32.199 interest in in the kind of contract they
04:01:34.319 worked out with you than you would have
04:01:36.680 and best thing to do is just pay him a
04:01:38.920 commission one time and on the stock but
04:01:43.159 you have to be Lord
04:01:45.159 th what human nature does to both other
04:01:48.600 people and to you and uh uh then you uh
04:01:55.479 uh you know if you think of if you think
04:01:59.120 of through well and he actually listen
04:02:03.040 to uh what Charlie has told
04:02:08.399 you
04:02:09.960 uh you'll have a big head start on most
04:02:12.720 people Charlie
04:02:14.960 there's one thing that I should mention
04:02:17.880 that really is terribly interesting
04:02:21.319 about Charlie Charlie knew the
04:02:25.000 importance of
04:02:26.760 psychology and human behavior and
04:02:29.439 incentives and all of that he he figured
04:02:31.720 that out very early and of course he he
04:02:35.319 gave some talks even on you know 25 or
04:02:40.600 so ways whatever it happened to be I
04:02:42.479 don't remember the exact number but
04:02:44.000 different ways that one person could
04:02:46.720 take advantage of another by
04:02:48.520 understanding how humans
04:02:51.080 behave and then after doing a
04:02:54.279 magnificent job of explaining it he
04:02:58.319 believed in understanding what others
04:03:01.159 would do but he thought it was beneath
04:03:03.840 him and to actually use those methods to
04:03:08.800 manipulate people that it's really
04:03:11.920 interesting human being
04:03:14.880 that thinks through the psychology of
04:03:17.520 human behavior and figures
04:03:20.439 out you know how you become a great
04:03:24.680 insurance
04:03:26.080 insurance uh salesman or manager in Wall
04:03:30.199 Street or accumulative assets under
04:03:32.319 management or whatever it may be and you
04:03:34.439 get very rich by understanding the
04:03:36.880 weaknesses of others to some extent and
04:03:40.239 then decide that it's very important for
04:03:43.920 you to recognize these when they occur
04:03:45.920 it's very important for you to know them
04:03:47.720 better than the person that actually is
04:03:50.600 using them but not but you don't have to
04:03:54.000 stoop to using him yourself and and
04:03:58.319 Charlie told me that that uh you know
04:04:02.279 his in his lifetime after he figured
04:04:04.399 this out there were a couple of times
04:04:06.120 when he used them he wasn't proud of it
04:04:08.560 but he also never lied to me so uh he uh
04:04:13.199 he uh
04:04:14.520 explained to me that you know there were
04:04:18.120 a couple times when he use some of these
04:04:20.199 techniques but but he it wasn't he
04:04:24.720 didn't plan on using him anymore but but
04:04:26.840 he also wanted me to know that if if if
04:04:30.600 I ever did something like that I wasn't
04:04:32.800 really behaving terribly that he he
04:04:35.600 allowed for he allowed for the fact that
04:04:38.199 humans humans May misbehave so I'm sure
04:04:42.279 that uh I behaved somewhat better before
04:04:47.199 my marriage than I did afterwards in my
04:04:49.199 enthusiasm for different activities like
04:04:52.880 dancing or something and and and he said
04:04:57.359 that's you know we all do it but don't
04:04:59.239 do it
04:05:02.040 again so that's U that's part of
04:05:05.279 acquiring human wisdom and speaking of
04:05:07.760 human wisdom we've just got that one
04:05:09.399 book out there by Charlie um I mean poor
04:05:12.680 Charlie's Almanac and that's worth
04:05:15.080 reading three or four times I think I
04:05:16.920 read Ben Graham's book about five or six
04:05:19.880 times and each time I read
04:05:22.880 it I realized that I I just needed to
04:05:27.640 think a little more deeply about certain
04:05:29.439 things they weren't complicated or
04:05:31.359 anything but
04:05:33.920 uh you know it it's better to it if
04:05:37.880 you've got some great instruction like
04:05:39.720 you get with Charlie it's better to read
04:05:41.920 it several times than to just just
04:05:43.760 figure you'll just read every book once
04:05:46.120 in it's in the
04:05:48.159 library okay let's go to section
04:05:51.840 four uh Jeff Rober from Tulsa Oklahoma
04:05:56.319 and I'm thinking of Dr Graham Mr Munger
04:06:02.199 your father and my question is for all
04:06:05.800 of us but it's probably especially for
04:06:09.000 the younger people in the
04:06:10.800 room uh the importance of picking the
04:06:13.800 right heroes in life choosing friends
04:06:17.840 wisely and maybe tell us a story if you
04:06:20.960 could about each of those folks thank
04:06:22.920 you sir well there's no question you're
04:06:25.880 100% right in terms of of uh having the
04:06:29.880 right Heroes and
04:06:33.359 uh you know you're you're lucky if you
04:06:37.040 get them I mean Charlie had Charlie had
04:06:40.560 him I had him and the interesting thing
04:06:43.640 my sister is here
04:06:45.080 today uh my younger sister that uh with
04:06:49.159 the two
04:06:50.239 survivors uh
04:06:52.920 and we both
04:06:55.640 experienced
04:06:57.159 having the same hero even though as We
04:07:02.120 Grew Older we saw that we didn't agree
04:07:06.720 with plenty of his ideas but we did
04:07:09.600 agree with his values and
04:07:12.359 motivation and and that's that's a
04:07:16.479 better lesson than having somebody that
04:07:18.760 that's reading to you from a catechism
04:07:20.760 that is has got a lot of rules in it
04:07:23.800 which are pretty good rules but but
04:07:26.760 there's a
04:07:28.080 special special place for somebody that
04:07:32.279 that is going to continue loving you
04:07:35.680 even if you break some of the rules and
04:07:39.479 uh that's what Charlie had in his life
04:07:43.040 was what Bernie and I had in our life so
04:07:46.040 so I would I would just repeat what you
04:07:49.680 said I'm don't need to give you a bunch
04:07:52.720 of well I when I um ran away from home
04:07:56.640 I'll give you a specific example with me
04:07:58.479 I when I ran away from home and went and
04:08:01.040 we had shed up to Hershey Pennsylvania
04:08:03.640 and got picked up by the state police
04:08:05.159 and everything and I talked these other
04:08:07.000 two guys into it and uh we lied like
04:08:11.000 crazy to the state police you know
04:08:13.520 saying we had our per parents'
04:08:15.439 permission some some some kid at the uh
04:08:19.479 place where we stayed had TI them off
04:08:21.600 that we'd run away from home and we
04:08:24.040 started like I said when the state
04:08:26.399 police picked us up we decided that two
04:08:29.840 things you know we decided to tell them
04:08:32.359 bunch of lies about the fact we had our
04:08:34.000 parents' permission and we decided we
04:08:35.520 better get out of pery because these
04:08:37.800 cops were going to find out sooner or
04:08:39.279 later and uh so anyway we end up back in
04:08:42.560 Washington after a couple days and uh
04:08:46.239 when I walked in the door
04:08:49.319 uh uh well one of the boys mother and
04:08:54.080 this other kid was the congressman Roger
04:08:55.800 Bell and his mother was in the hospital
04:08:58.399 over this whole thing he taking out his
04:09:00.720 cash and the savings bonds and so she
04:09:03.640 was sick and judge Bell her husband was
04:09:06.600 all concerned and everything and I
04:09:08.279 walked in the door and in Washington and
04:09:11.399 my mother said how come he came back so
04:09:13.080 soon
04:09:14.080 and my father
04:09:15.359 said he he said I know you can do better
04:09:21.520 and and uh I just paid more attention to
04:09:25.439 my father than my mother and uh so you
04:09:28.880 want to have the right Heroes and you
04:09:31.760 don't have to have them it's not the
04:09:33.760 heroes based on what they've
04:09:35.119 accomplished and it's it's just you know
04:09:37.600 it's it's it's uh it's it's the people
04:09:41.279 that you want to be yourself and uh if
04:09:45.640 you if you copy the right people you're
04:09:48.040 off to a great start and I don't
04:09:50.359 mean great start about making money I
04:09:52.600 mean a great start about living your
04:09:55.000 life so you can check with my sister
04:09:58.800 birdie who was here and see if I've told
04:10:01.359 the story correctly she ran away from
04:10:02.920 home too incidentally but but uh she
04:10:06.080 didn't get as far as I got but uh uh she
04:10:10.080 was running away to go over to my
04:10:12.439 grandfather's house which was about 2
04:10:14.239 miles
04:10:16.119 away uh but I I don't want to denigrate
04:10:19.800 her run away a bill these because she
04:10:22.600 she was much more accomplished than than
04:10:24.600 I am and all kinds of other things but
04:10:26.840 when it comes to running away I I
04:10:29.279 definitely uh
04:10:32.600 outlaster okay let's go to Becky uh this
04:10:36.199 question comes from vant Sharma in India
04:10:39.600 Warren you and Charlie have often said
04:10:41.399 that you were able to identify the
04:10:42.840 people you want to go into business with
04:10:44.840 and have had an exceptional record in
04:10:46.880 that however in the case of pilot we
04:10:49.760 noticed that the final stake purchase
04:10:51.600 ended up in a dispute and had a sense of
04:10:54.000 smart accounting to put it one way to
04:10:55.760 squeeze a little more out from the deal
04:10:58.119 than was deserved by the seller knowing
04:11:00.680 well that this has been settled out of
04:11:02.199 court and needs due confidentiality I
04:11:04.520 would like your views on some of the
04:11:05.920 lessons learned that may be beneficial
04:11:07.920 for future deals to watch for and for
04:11:10.600 coming leadership to look out for as
04:11:12.319 well well I I'll I'll make two comments
04:11:15.840 on that that a couple of the directors
04:11:18.640 had our doubts about their doubts about
04:11:21.000 going in uh and uh in any event pilot is
04:11:27.960 working out well for us and as my friend
04:11:32.399 Sam Butler one time said to me that and
04:11:36.319 he was talking in general about certain
04:11:38.600 kinds of situations but he said well
04:11:41.479 waren he said alls well well that ends
04:11:45.080 and that's where we
04:11:48.840 are so we'll go to station
04:11:51.290 [Laughter]
04:12:05.840 five well we're getting to station 5
04:12:08.319 I'll tell you a little bit more about
04:12:09.520 the fellow that is now running pilot and
04:12:12.520 knew you may
04:12:13.680 have met here that uh Greg had known for
04:12:18.520 a long long time and he grew up in
04:12:22.680 Omaha and uh uh came from a poor family
04:12:28.600 and was raised by his mother right and
04:12:32.399 went to the same high school public high
04:12:34.159 school that my wife went to North High
04:12:38.359 went to University of Maha set an
04:12:41.439 alltime record in
04:12:43.680 in in the rushing yardage at playing
04:12:46.920 there he was a bouncer yes drafted by
04:12:49.640 the New York Giants as I remember
04:12:51.399 exactly yeah and uh uh but
04:12:55.359 then injured actually in spring training
04:12:58.279 I as I remember in some way and so he
04:13:01.479 ended up being an
04:13:02.760 intern not an intern but a trainee you
04:13:06.040 might say for for been American before I
04:13:09.119 was there and uh and now he
04:13:13.640 is uh still relatively young and he's
04:13:18.399 running a
04:13:20.239 huge company and we' we've got
04:13:25.199 incredible confidence in what he will do
04:13:28.880 and we like very very very much the
04:13:32.040 business that was created by by Big Jim
04:13:35.040 hlam and uh uh
04:13:39.439 the you know it it really is most and
04:13:43.479 only in an American type story but it it
04:13:48.119 does show
04:13:49.319 you what somebody was some real stuff
04:13:53.080 and with a mother that believes in
04:13:56.159 them and with bad breaks along the way I
04:14:00.159 mean imagine how you'd feel if you were
04:14:01.640 drafted by the New York Giants and and
04:14:03.800 then you suffered some in injury in
04:14:06.080 Spring train or something I mean you
04:14:07.680 know you spend your it just it hurts but
04:14:11.080 uh it's not an experience I would have
04:14:13.359 ever had it's I mean that was the last
04:14:15.640 guy chosen you but the uh uh you know to
04:14:20.560 see that he's running a company about
04:14:23.640 depends on the price of the deal but
04:14:25.040 it's a huge company and uh what does he
04:14:29.319 have 20 25,000 yeah employees yeah and
04:14:34.399 and he's got many many many years to go
04:14:37.439 so I couldn't be more pleased about not
04:14:40.720 only the acquisition of pilot but but
04:14:45.199 just what it it tells you about America
04:14:48.159 you can C what what do you have to look
04:14:51.000 up read about him in Google or an
04:14:53.279 interview with Adam yeah um I try to
04:14:56.800 think of it's a podcast yeah he he's got
04:14:59.680 a podcast podcast that will just blow
04:15:02.040 you away and if you don't think this is
04:15:03.680 a a great
04:15:06.119 country and has a lot of great people it
04:15:09.119 all I got to do is read that podcast so
04:15:11.640 but we do have a great set of ass are oh
04:15:14.000 yeah you know if you look at Pilot we
04:15:16.119 have 800 more than 800 station Travel
04:15:20.399 Centers and just so everybody knows I
04:15:22.119 mean the beauty of that and there is a
04:15:23.760 question regarding this morning around
04:15:25.800 fuel choices at Pilot and the exciting
04:15:28.960 thing is in the end Pilot's going to
04:15:31.119 serve whatever fuel our customers need
04:15:33.520 it can be electric it can be renewable
04:15:35.640 diesel it can be diesel um or any of the
04:15:39.920 various sustainable fuels but the point
04:15:42.520 is has exceptional locations that are on
04:15:46.640 the interstate highways and we hundreds
04:15:48.640 of them hundreds of them and we bought
04:15:50.279 an incredible franchise and now we have
04:15:53.080 a great leadership team in both Adam and
04:15:55.239 his team that's around him so we're
04:15:57.439 we're we're pleased where that
04:15:59.640 opportunity will go yeah we've
04:16:02.279 got probably the average one might be 10
04:16:05.720 or 12 acres or something like that Zone
04:16:07.960 commercial on interstates throughout the
04:16:09.800 whole United States I mean it it who
04:16:12.760 know knows but uh but what was created
04:16:17.080 there is amazing too you follow the the
04:16:19.640 played at University of TNS Sylvania I
04:16:21.640 mean University of Tennessee uh and uh
04:16:27.159 undefeated and uh uh came away from this
04:16:31.399 football team and you think well another
04:16:34.239 football player you know maybe that he
04:16:36.520 goes out and and there may be some
04:16:39.840 intermediate Parts in the story but a
04:16:41.520 little bit but he he buys a gas station
04:16:44.680 and he turns it into something that is
04:16:47.960 huge so it's we're we're really
04:16:51.359 delighted with with it and uh and You
04:16:55.800 Know It uh it's another kind of only an
04:16:59.399 America story and uh uh you know how
04:17:04.319 many of us can become an all American
04:17:08.000 number one ranks team let alone start a
04:17:11.199 a business that was on these sort of
04:17:14.560 heights so we feel very good about it
04:17:16.800 Becky no I think they're ready for five
04:17:19.000 now oh I think he's up there now's ready
04:17:21.439 to go okay go to
04:17:23.560 it hello Mr Buffet uh my name is j y I
04:17:29.080 came from uh micro City hyan China so I
04:17:34.720 want to express my sincere gratitude for
04:17:37.840 you for the extraordinary value you
04:17:40.720 generated for shareholders and the
04:17:43.399 positive influences you've had on
04:17:46.319 younger generation of investors like
04:17:49.199 us and uh my question relates to the
04:17:52.920 concept of maximizing the duration of
04:17:56.960 compounding as individuals age the
04:18:00.080 quality of compounding inevitably
04:18:03.199 diminishes what are your secrets in
04:18:05.880 maintaining your sharp man extraordinary
04:18:09.880 judgment and great physical condition we
04:18:14.199 wish you well thank you well you don't
04:18:16.560 know me well but that's I
04:18:19.560 like just keep talking I
04:18:23.880 mean the uh well I you know I'm just you
04:18:28.880 have to be just plain lucky I mean
04:18:30.640 there's no question about it that uh
04:18:32.960 that uh there's 100 or a thousand you
04:18:37.359 know multiply number of times that some
04:18:40.439 drunk could have pulled out of a car and
04:18:42.800 broadsided me or you know just all the
04:18:47.119 bad luck that you can have in life and I
04:18:51.840 you know you can say my my great skill
04:18:54.520 has been avoiding bad luck but that
04:18:56.319 isn't a skill that's luck or bad bad bad
04:19:00.000 activities and and you know and then to
04:19:02.399 get to be you know I would not have been
04:19:05.119 a if you'd taken my high school class
04:19:07.720 and you say you know a couple of you are
04:19:09.880 going to live to be 90 men are going to
04:19:12.040 live to be 90
04:19:13.760 3 I you know I wouldn't I would not have
04:19:16.920 been a heavy favorite I can tell you
04:19:18.359 that and I wouldn't have bet on myself
04:19:20.560 uh but uh you
04:19:24.159 just now you you shouldn't make the most
04:19:26.920 of your luck when you get it and
04:19:28.439 sometimes I've done that and sometimes I
04:19:30.279 haven't
04:19:31.920 uh I mean it is absolutely true that if
04:19:36.960 I had it to do over again there there'd
04:19:39.680 be a lot of different choices I would
04:19:41.359 make what do they would have ended up
04:19:43.159 working out as well as as things have
04:19:45.520 worked out it's hard to imagine how they
04:19:47.199 could have worked out any better so so I
04:19:50.680 but it is interesting how many mistakes
04:19:52.560 you can make uh if you just keep going
04:19:56.960 and Charlie you know we used to talk
04:20:00.800 about that that you just Soldier through
04:20:02.760 you just keep going and but you still
04:20:06.279 need luck you don't you don't want to
04:20:09.040 anybody that says I did it all myself is
04:20:10.880 just kidding I mean it's just it's it's
04:20:13.040 uh they're delusional and uh uh you know
04:20:18.600 actually live in a country where the
04:20:20.680 life expectancy is pretty darn good you
04:20:22.760 know so that alone is a huge plus I was
04:20:26.800 was born if I've been born my sister's
04:20:29.680 here and she was born female and she's
04:20:34.279 just as smart as I was and everything
04:20:35.960 but but even my own family who really
04:20:41.040 did well particular my dad love us all
04:20:44.640 equally uh and and and in a terrific
04:20:49.359 manner but he still told me that that
04:20:54.040 this is 10 or well was born 10 years
04:20:56.880 after the the 19th amendment was passed
04:21:00.720 and but he told basically told my my
04:21:05.199 sisters you know that Mary young well
04:21:07.520 you still have your looks and he told me
04:21:09.159 that the world you know that power in
04:21:11.560 new is new and nature
04:21:14.520 and that uh you really could do anything
04:21:18.840 well I found there were a lot of things
04:21:20.040 I couldn't do but but uh it it the
04:21:25.199 message given to females and
04:21:27.600 males was
04:21:30.840 incredibly uh different by the most
04:21:34.040 well-meaning and loving of parents you
04:21:37.600 know like I say in 1930 I mean it been
04:21:39.800 that way for millions of years it's it
04:21:43.760 changed quite
04:21:45.800 dramatically but obviously not
04:21:48.800 completely but during my lifetime but
04:21:51.159 it's been during a latter half of my
04:21:52.880 lifetime if you take my sisters if
04:21:55.520 they've been born even five or 10 years
04:21:58.119 later they they still would have
04:22:00.119 been uh you know getting instructions
04:22:03.560 when they went away to college to be
04:22:05.199 sure and be sure and get married well or
04:22:09.640 get arranged so that you're going to be
04:22:11.640 married you know while you're in school
04:22:14.000 because after you get out all the all
04:22:16.560 the good ones are taken that was birdie
04:22:19.159 was telling me that was a message that
04:22:21.560 that you know basically was had been
04:22:24.680 imparted uh to most lot of the women she
04:22:29.560 had met obviously and so
04:22:32.159 it it
04:22:34.040 really it's it's extraordinary how much
04:22:37.279 progress we've made but it's it's
04:22:40.520 unbelievable how long it took to get
04:22:42.960 made I mean that it uh it really does
04:22:46.760 make
04:22:47.560 you wonder about you know we've got all
04:22:50.239 these heroes from American history and
04:22:54.040 all the wonderful things they did but
04:22:57.000 but how could they say all men are
04:22:59.840 created equal and then write a
04:23:02.520 constitution that women you know allow
04:23:05.199 women not to be able to own property and
04:23:07.680 depending on the state I mean just
04:23:09.840 terrible conditions U but anyway that's
04:23:13.520 how you learn about what the humans can
04:23:17.230 [Applause]
04:23:20.640 do and I feel and you got to feel better
04:23:24.119 about the future for your kids than you
04:23:25.800 would have felt 100 years ago no matter
04:23:28.720 you know what the situation is anyway
04:23:32.239 we'll move to
04:23:33.520 Becky this question comes from Linda
04:23:35.960 Frasier in Westport Connecticut Dear Mr
04:23:39.040 Buffett in the past you've specified
04:23:40.960 that 90% of your wife inheritance be
04:23:43.439 invested in a lowcost S&P 500 Index Fund
04:23:46.399 and 10% in short-term government bonds
04:23:49.439 but the market cap of The Magnificent
04:23:51.159 Seven tech stocks now represents more
04:23:53.239 than one quarter of the market cap
04:23:55.000 weighted S&P 500 Index which seems like
04:23:57.479 a big bet on the tech sector I was
04:24:00.040 wondering if you would now recommend
04:24:01.840 investing some portion of the funds in a
04:24:03.840 lowcost equal weight S&P 500 Index Fund
04:24:06.920 rather than having all of the equities
04:24:08.720 exposure and a tech heavy market cap
04:24:10.720 weighted fund well that's an interesting
04:24:12.840 question and and I will tell you that I
04:24:16.119 I revise my will about every 3 years or
04:24:19.159 so and I get little thoughts from time
04:24:22.560 to time and then you don't you don't
04:24:24.600 change it every time you do it uh you
04:24:26.720 get a tiny thing but uh uh the one
04:24:31.680 section I haven't changed is that that
04:24:35.199 with my wife that she she got
04:24:39.399 left a huge amount of money by practicly
04:24:44.720 anybody's uh measurement
04:24:48.840 except uh pittens compared to what uh
04:24:53.880 I've accumulated in total and it doesn't
04:24:57.880 it won't make one bit of difference to
04:24:59.960 her in life uh whether she beats the S&P
04:25:05.520 or anything else Al all all I want to
04:25:09.279 leave is plenty of money to take care of
04:25:12.119 way Way Beyond anything she'll ever
04:25:13.520 spend and at the same time give her as
04:25:15.239 much peace of mind as possible and and
04:25:17.560 really make it so that the trusty you
04:25:19.399 administers it doesn't really have to
04:25:22.119 doesn't have to worry about whether it
04:25:23.640 just doesn't make any difference whether
04:25:25.040 she beats the S&P or not and the main
04:25:29.159 thing is that she
04:25:30.800 feels that she feels that she's in a
04:25:33.239 financial position which of course she
04:25:34.800 will be that uh she doesn't even need to
04:25:37.680 think about it and the trustee doesn't
04:25:39.159 have to worry about getting sued or
04:25:40.960 anything else so
04:25:42.880 it's it's it's
04:25:44.760 uh it's simply not an economic condition
04:25:47.720 now obviously with 99% plus of what I
04:25:54.119 have going to to uh philanthropy and and
04:25:58.560 you know and I've got my three children
04:26:01.520 and the one good thing is that
04:26:04.920 they've at the age of 70 69 and
04:26:08.399 65 they have matured remarkably probably
04:26:11.880 more than their father and uh that uh
04:26:16.239 but the at the same time they've got
04:26:19.159 less time to work with the money than
04:26:21.239 they would if you know they were 50 or
04:26:22.920 something like that
04:26:24.399 so you do you do the best in it in
04:26:28.880 accomplishing your
04:26:30.840 objectives in your
04:26:33.680 will
04:26:35.399 and and in the end uh you know you can't
04:26:40.760 you don't know what's going to happen
04:26:41.840 after you die die but you make sure that
04:26:44.239 that uh to the extent that you
04:26:47.239 leave have a lot of money to leave you
04:26:49.640 take obviously you uh you want to say
04:26:53.279 thanks to a lot of people and quite a
04:26:56.239 few people in terms of specific requests
04:26:58.199 you want to take care of the your family
04:27:00.800 but but in my case that requires
04:27:03.760 practically no money and and the uh a
04:27:07.600 fair amount for taxes but I have and my
04:27:09.720 children are in charge of what happens
04:27:11.880 to the funds that are left but like I
04:27:16.399 said the the problem is when you live as
04:27:20.439 long as I have and kids get older you
04:27:23.600 who knows what happens with mortality
04:27:25.279 tables and they're the ones that I
04:27:27.000 really uh want to see handle the
04:27:30.560 distributions and they will and they'll
04:27:32.199 be very good about it and uh
04:27:36.840 uh but if we're all alive 3 years from
04:27:40.439 now they'll be 3 years older and so
04:27:43.040 everything you can't solve everything in
04:27:44.640 life you do the best you can with it uh
04:27:48.920 uh people do interesting things I've
04:27:52.680 been around probably as many rich people
04:27:55.199 as almost anybody and a fair number I
04:27:57.720 know what they they're doing or have
04:28:00.680 done with their funds and uh the idea
04:28:05.760 that you can
04:28:07.960 have a huge amount of
04:28:10.439 money and leave every everybody very
04:28:13.279 rich and have
04:28:15.279 people liking each other less when it
04:28:18.680 all happens is it's humans are really uh
04:28:23.720 they are interesting to watch some of
04:28:25.199 them handle it beautifully and others
04:28:27.239 are terrible one thing lawyers will
04:28:29.880 always tell you is um don't don't use
04:28:34.279 ctools in other words you know when you
04:28:36.359 change your mind on a will just write a
04:28:39.000 new one but tear up the old one don't do
04:28:40.760 it by just adding ctisle
04:28:43.239 uh but I believe I'm
04:28:45.720 correct uh certainly read it that Paul
04:28:49.640 Getty was the richest man of the world
04:28:52.640 presumably uh at one point in the 1950s
04:28:56.000 or 60s and it's very interesting guy to
04:28:58.520 read about and he had five W five
04:29:02.920 U uh wives and he's the one whose
04:29:07.119 grandson was kidna kidnapped and they
04:29:10.520 they sent sent spetti
04:29:13.119 a an ear of the child and everything I
04:29:16.239 mean it it's not it's not a happy life
04:29:19.000 when you get through it but the one one
04:29:20.800 thing he he did that was kind of
04:29:22.119 interesting he actually liked to use
04:29:24.560 cardols because I think he had like 25
04:29:27.239 of them and it was kind of his way of
04:29:30.720 writing well I'm taking you out of the
04:29:32.520 world because you know and so he he he
04:29:36.600 uh he he sort of delighted in explaining
04:29:40.640 through his will what uh uh how we felt
04:29:45.920 about all these people I mean you really
04:29:48.800 get some
04:29:49.960 strange things revealed in a will I just
04:29:53.239 I just read
04:29:54.439 about uh a will of fellow that made a
04:29:58.000 whole lot of money and was leaving it to
04:30:02.199 his uh I don't know whether his children
04:30:05.680 grandchild whatever it may have been but
04:30:07.479 in any event his opening line and his
04:30:10.239 will is is
04:30:12.720 and this was done some years ago but I
04:30:16.279 know something about the family uh this
04:30:19.279 opening line in effect
04:30:21.439 said I'm writing this will while I'm
04:30:24.279 writing in the economy session of
04:30:28.199 Eastern Airlines number such and such I
04:30:30.479 mean he believed in getting getting
04:30:32.600 right to the point of what what what the
04:30:35.640 people that were recipients how they
04:30:37.800 should live and he was going to be
04:30:39.760 judging them and it's just so damn
04:30:42.520 interesting to watch people's Wheels but
04:30:44.600 uh you know one one guy left a lot of
04:30:47.399 money to his uh wife on the condition
04:30:51.439 that she remarries so that at least one
04:30:53.600 man would mourn his passing you
04:30:58.640 know well I'm not giving legal advice
04:31:01.640 here as they always say but
04:31:05.199 but I feel I feel very very very good
04:31:09.680 about how things have turned out and uh
04:31:13.720 uh
04:31:15.560 and I wish I could figure out ways
04:31:20.119 better to use you know the really vast
04:31:24.319 resources I've got in the some of the
04:31:26.399 really important questions of the world
04:31:29.319 but but I haven't been able to do that I
04:31:31.960 mean I had a few goals when I
04:31:35.520 was 30 or 40 in may have Britt them into
04:31:38.600 the wills then in terms of what the
04:31:40.960 world needed done and how the money
04:31:43.720 could
04:31:44.600 be used and unfortunately I decided that
04:31:49.640 it just what they weren't feasible to
04:31:52.520 accomplish and of course I was setting
04:31:55.119 out to accomplish things that that were
04:31:58.119 important but nobody had solved yet so
04:32:00.279 you got to expect that why why should I
04:32:02.000 be able to solve them but nevertheless
04:32:04.199 it it's uh it's an interesting but and
04:32:07.239 the one thing about it is everybody here
04:32:10.080 I don't know about the ones who have
04:32:11.159 come from other countries but they
04:32:13.399 should you should have a will CU if you
04:32:15.359 don't have a will you still have a will
04:32:17.239 and it'll be whatever the state says and
04:32:19.880 it's amazing four American
04:32:22.560 presidents died intested without Wills
04:32:26.600 four you know we've only had 45 and
04:32:32.239 imagine becoming president of the United
04:32:34.479 States and not having a
04:32:36.800 will uh
04:32:39.439 but you can look up a nobody reason I
04:32:42.359 think I think
04:32:43.640 Lincoln uh I'm certain Lincoln was one
04:32:47.479 of the four and here's a man I
04:32:54.040 mean I don't know what you can always
04:32:56.720 say well he didn't get around to it but
04:32:58.439 that but it's hard to imagine that that
04:33:01.840 uh why Abraham Lincoln would have died
04:33:06.039 intestin I'm sure we've got some Lincoln
04:33:07.799 Scholars out there that will write me
04:33:10.039 after this and explain why but I
04:33:12.480 and I'll be interested to receive their
04:33:15.400 letters but human beings are human
04:33:18.359 beings and and uh we all have weaknesses
04:33:23.879 and peculiarities and everything else
04:33:25.958 and don't be too hard on
04:33:28.639 yourself uh because you have some of
04:33:31.561 those but don't be totally forgiving
04:33:33.639 either you can change the future you
04:33:35.639 can't change the past but you can't
04:33:37.080 change the future okay station six
04:33:45.118 um good afternoon my name is Caroline
04:33:48.039 and I'm a lawyer in San
04:33:49.919 Diego don't hold that against
04:33:52.599 me remember Mr Munger was once an
04:33:55.199 attorney too right
04:33:57.400 um first I'd like to sincerely thank you
04:34:00.080 Mr Buffett for your business Integrity
04:34:02.958 tireless leadership and generous
04:34:05.438 contribution to
04:34:07.480 philanthropy my question for the
04:34:09.599 distinguished panel of two is now that
04:34:13.000 the AI Genie is out of the bottle as
04:34:15.919 someone astutely put it earlier today
04:34:19.080 what business in Brookshire haway may be
04:34:22.719 most at risk with
04:34:25.080 AI well that's a wonderful
04:34:28.000 question uh the problem is I really
04:34:31.080 don't know anything about AI but
04:34:34.160 uh uh
04:34:37.320 obviously you know anything
04:34:40.639 that's labor intensitive intensive and
04:34:44.118 that uh that
04:34:47.160 uh it can create an enormous amount of
04:34:50.561 leisure time now what the world does
04:34:53.520 with leisure time is another question uh
04:34:57.919 whether more leisure time I know an
04:35:01.320 awful lot of people think when they go
04:35:02.680 to work at first what they want is
04:35:04.719 leisure time and what I like is actually
04:35:08.160 having more more problems to solve than
04:35:11.520 this
04:35:12.320 uh uh but AI is
04:35:16.719 profound and I mean that's what makes
04:35:21.080 it makes it a genie you know is what
04:35:24.520 what going to happen
04:35:27.320 uh
04:35:29.438 uh I'll uh I could tell a few Genie
04:35:33.400 jokes about better or
04:35:36.480 not uh but uh I guess where
04:35:42.719 I I don't know what you
04:35:44.719 know in terms of our businesses they'll
04:35:48.118 figure things out I mean we've got smart
04:35:50.400 people and and it's obviously if it's
04:35:55.118 used in a pro-social way it's got
04:35:57.278 terrific benefits to society but I don't
04:36:00.561 know how you make sure that that's what
04:36:03.039 happens anymore than I know how to be
04:36:05.320 sure that when you use two two atomic
04:36:09.000 bombs in World War II that you know that
04:36:12.240 you hadn't created something that could
04:36:13.799 destroy the world later on yeah yeah I
04:36:17.160 think when we think of AI a lot of the
04:36:19.039 business units I mean we're truly WN
04:36:20.799 trying to think uh how does it make us
04:36:22.919 more efficient more effective I mean it
04:36:24.840 it results in more idle time and we're
04:36:27.400 probably not thinking of the iter
04:36:29.759 iterative I AI where um we're looking at
04:36:33.480 very specific processes where our people
04:36:36.160 can implement it and either at times it
04:36:39.719 displaces the labor but then hopefully
04:36:41.719 there's other opportunities for them
04:36:43.480 within the within the business but I
04:36:45.759 think you know when you think of all our
04:36:48.118 businesses I mean we're we're we do have
04:36:50.199 a heavy labor workforce in a lot them
04:36:52.561 but I think we at the stage we're at as
04:36:55.278 a as a company and and maybe where it's
04:36:57.840 at right now it's really around how do
04:36:59.799 we do things more effective more
04:37:03.199 efficiently um more safely if it's
04:37:07.240 involves dangerous processes so it's
04:37:10.438 we're we're early in
04:37:12.879 yeah John John mayard KES was just
04:37:16.039 wonderful to read and incredible mind
04:37:19.039 but in around the time I was born he uh
04:37:24.000 he wrote a book about what could happen
04:37:27.438 uh I don't know whether it was in the
04:37:29.438 next 100 years or whatever and and he
04:37:33.320 predicted correctly that that that
04:37:36.400 output per capita would grow at this
04:37:38.639 incredible rate that it has but but uh
04:37:43.080 in terms of speculating as what people
04:37:45.199 would do with that I mean this this guy
04:37:49.680 was unbelievably
04:37:52.320 smart but uh it hasn't developed exactly
04:37:58.438 the way he predicted he was right
04:38:00.879 about what was going to go into the
04:38:03.199 equation but he wasn't he didn't have a
04:38:05.480 figured out exactly what at all what
04:38:08.438 what what uh would be the result so it's
04:38:11.919 it
04:38:12.840 is it is
04:38:15.320 really well we didn't
04:38:18.599 know when we were developing the bomb
04:38:21.799 that there would probably
04:38:23.438 be
04:38:25.520 as very soon n countries three of whom
04:38:30.278 we should worry about plenty that will
04:38:32.359 have what they have but we didn't really
04:38:34.599 have any choice and you could have had
04:38:36.879 all kinds of Papers written on and
04:38:38.719 everything else but we were going to do
04:38:39.958 it anyway we needed to do it but and if
04:38:42.599 you haven't read it it's fascinating to
04:38:44.520 go to Google and read the letter by Leo
04:38:48.160 zard and Albert Einstein to President
04:38:50.639 Roosevelt written about a month before U
04:38:54.840 almost exactly a month before the uh
04:38:57.599 Germany or Hitler moved
04:38:59.561 into Poland and it laid out well Li's
04:39:06.919 Lord knew what was going to happen for
04:39:10.599 at a good what was going to happen in
04:39:12.400 terms of nuclear bomb development and he
04:39:15.879 he couldn't get through to Roosevelt but
04:39:17.759 Roosevelt but he knew that a letter
04:39:20.438 signed by Albert Einstein would so it's
04:39:23.160 probably the most important letter ever
04:39:24.719 written and you can read which it's just
04:39:27.599 fascinating to me uh
04:39:31.000 but that started the Manhattan Project
04:39:33.799 that started you know it just everything
04:39:36.199 float out of it and like I I'll bet
04:39:39.240 anything that Roosevelt didn't
04:39:40.600 understand it but he of Albert Einstein
04:39:43.840 sent a letter and and uh and he probably
04:39:48.400 knew what he was talking about and and
04:39:51.240 he better get he better start the
04:39:53.560 Manhattan Project it is it is it's just
04:39:56.920 unbelievable what happens in this world
04:39:58.958 anyway let's move on to uh be Becky I
04:40:03.840 guess is next right yep um Randy Jeffs
04:40:07.480 from Irvine California the March 25th
04:40:10.040 2024 Wall Street Journal reported that
04:40:12.320 the treasury market is about sixfold
04:40:14.560 larger than before the 2008 2009 crisis
04:40:18.638 do you think that at some point in time
04:40:20.360 the World Market will no longer be able
04:40:22.160 to absorb all of the US debt being
04:40:25.160 offered well I would
04:40:27.680 say the answer of course I don't know
04:40:30.120 but the but the my best
04:40:33.400 speculation uh is that
04:40:38.120 us that will be
04:40:42.958 acceptable but uh for a very long time
04:40:46.560 because there's not much alternative but
04:40:49.680 it won't be the qualtity it it uh you
04:40:54.000 know any any you know the national debt
04:40:56.520 was nothing to speak of like you know
04:40:58.878 for a long long time and then uh
04:41:03.200 uh it won't be the quantity it'll it'll
04:41:05.920 be
04:41:06.840 whether in any
04:41:08.958 way uh
04:41:12.280 inflation would get let loose in a way
04:41:16.840 that that really threatened the whole
04:41:20.920 world economic situation and there
04:41:23.440 really isn't any
04:41:25.280 alternative to the dollar as a reserve
04:41:29.400 currency and you get a lot of people
04:41:31.120 give you a lot of speeches on that but
04:41:33.040 that that really is the answer that and
04:41:36.280 uh and Paul vulker worried about that
04:41:41.280 back in 19 you know well before 1980 but
04:41:45.958 but he had threats on his life and I
04:41:48.440 happened to have a little contact with
04:41:50.878 him at that time and
04:41:53.760 uh he was an amazing
04:41:57.400 amazing fellow that uh that in effect
04:42:03.160 decided that he had to act
04:42:07.760 or
04:42:09.360 the really the
04:42:12.160 the financial system would fall apart in
04:42:14.798 some way that he couldn't predict and
04:42:17.360 and uh and he did it and he you know had
04:42:20.878 people threaten his life and do all
04:42:23.160 kinds of things and but he was the man
04:42:26.280 for that
04:42:27.480 crisis uh but it it wasn't the quantity
04:42:32.520 of US debt that was being offered that
04:42:37.320 threatened the system then it was it was
04:42:39.958 the fact that that inflation and the
04:42:44.000 future value of the dollar you know the
04:42:46.160 cash is trash type thinking the
04:42:50.080 turn you know that
04:42:53.520 that we setting up something that could
04:42:56.920 really
04:42:57.878 affect uh the future of the world in
04:43:00.920 terms of its economic system and Paul
04:43:02.798 Booker took it on and uh he was got as
04:43:07.440 could be and if you haven't read a book
04:43:09.760 or two about him uh or the one he last
04:43:12.840 Roe you really ought to take a look at
04:43:14.480 it
04:43:16.680 uh but
04:43:19.480 uh it is I I don't worry about the
04:43:23.200 quantity I worry about the fiscal
04:43:25.240 deficit you know if it it but I'm not a
04:43:27.560 warrier just generally I mean I I think
04:43:30.040 about it and uh uh but uh I don't sit
04:43:35.920 and get up work myself into a stew about
04:43:39.798 it in the least but I
04:43:41.760 but I can't help thinking about it and
04:43:44.560 that's uh we've got a we've got a great
04:43:50.560 attention it's it's interesting and I
04:43:52.680 think media enters into this and the uh
04:43:57.080 focusing the focuses on the fed and they
04:44:00.958 you know they just love it because
04:44:02.520 things are always happening and
04:44:03.680 economists are always saying what's
04:44:05.520 going to happen with the fed and
04:44:06.840 everything else but uh uh the the f
04:44:11.638 deficit is what should be focused on and
04:44:15.638 uh
04:44:19.480 and uh J Paul is
04:44:23.798 a a a not only a great human being but
04:44:28.040 he's he's a very very wise man but he
04:44:33.560 doesn't control fiscal policy and every
04:44:35.480 now and then he he sends out a kind of a
04:44:39.958 disguised plea for please please pay
04:44:43.080 attention to this because that's where
04:44:45.000 the trouble will be if if we have
04:44:50.718 it
04:44:55.320 yeah as one of the comics used to say
04:44:58.638 there's a standup comic used to say who
04:45:00.400 have I forgotten to offend after just
04:45:03.400 talk and I always feel like that after
04:45:05.280 these meetings but we've got we've got
04:45:07.638 time for at least one question and maybe
04:45:10.440 two but let's go to station
04:45:13.160 Seven hello my name is Dennis from gon
04:45:16.480 Germany I'm my first time here I'm here
04:45:19.200 with my friend who would by the way love
04:45:20.920 to invite you to dinner you talked about
04:45:23.120 the importance of Heroes and we are very
04:45:25.080 happy to and thankful that we have you
04:45:27.798 as our hero with great values and uh
04:45:30.878 thank you for that first of
04:45:32.798 all my question is it is clear that you
04:45:36.480 achieved great success in life earlier
04:45:38.680 you talked about every investment having
04:45:40.520 opportun cost from what I've learned in
04:45:43.160 life that does not only apply to
04:45:46.600 investing your money but also to
04:45:48.280 investing your time and every hour you
04:45:50.440 spend in your office is an hour you
04:45:52.560 cannot spend with your spouse or
04:45:54.000 children with the life experience you
04:45:56.360 have now if you had the possibility to
04:45:58.320 start all over again would you set your
04:46:00.120 priorities any any different if yes how
04:46:03.480 and why and what's the best way to
04:46:05.718 invite you to dinner well
04:46:14.120 well that definitely won't be one of my
04:46:16.718 priorities if I figure
04:46:20.160 out but that listen don't take it
04:46:23.240 personally because that uh when when you
04:46:26.040 know you can figure out the at the
04:46:28.878 maximum how how long a period I've got
04:46:31.440 and
04:46:33.000 uh I don't I don't think uh I mean I can
04:46:37.360 figure out all kinds of things that
04:46:38.680 should have been done differently but
04:46:41.400 so what you know I mean I'm not perfect
04:46:45.200 I I don't believe in lots
04:46:48.160 of self-criticism or being
04:46:51.480 unrealistic about either what you are or
04:46:53.920 what you've accomplished or what you'd
04:46:56.240 like to do you do the you know you do a
04:46:59.280 lot of things and and uh who knows
04:47:04.760 whether somewhat different
04:47:08.080 tradeoffs
04:47:09.600 uh uh
04:47:12.400 you know you just can't you can't you
04:47:15.558 don't know where the path would have L I
04:47:17.160 feel I I don't think there's any any any
04:47:21.480 room in beating up yourself over what's
04:47:24.120 happened in the past you know it's
04:47:25.718 happened and you then you get to live
04:47:28.200 the rest of the life and you don't know
04:47:30.240 how long it's going to be and and uh you
04:47:34.360 keep trying trying to do the things that
04:47:37.680 are important to you and and if I was
04:47:41.638 a doctor or if I was a you all kinds of
04:47:45.040 different professions I might do
04:47:46.440 different things but I really
04:47:48.240 enjoy um managing money for people who
04:47:51.160 trust me I don't have any reason to do
04:47:53.120 it for financial reasons uh you know I'm
04:47:56.680 not running a hedge fund or getting an
04:47:58.240 override on anything but I just like the
04:48:01.680 feeling of being trusted Charlie feel
04:48:03.840 felt the same way you know that's that's
04:48:06.120 a good way to feel in life and uh uh and
04:48:09.440 it continues to be a good good feelings
04:48:11.760 so I'm not really looking to change much
04:48:15.200 uh and uh uh you know if I'm very lucky
04:48:20.080 I get to play it out for six or seven
04:48:22.480 years it could end tomorrow but that's
04:48:25.080 that's true of everybody although the
04:48:26.760 equation isn't exactly the same but I I
04:48:30.600 don't believe in beating yourself up
04:48:32.638 over anything you've done in past and I
04:48:35.558 don't believe
04:48:38.160 in well I believe in I believe in
04:48:43.360 trying
04:48:45.840 to find you know
04:48:49.080 what what you're good at what you
04:48:52.080 enjoy and uh and then I think the one
04:48:57.160 thing that you can aspire to be because
04:48:59.360 this can be done by anybody and it's
04:49:01.440 amazing doesn't have anything to do with
04:49:03.440 money but you can be kind you know
04:49:06.280 that's you can be kind if
04:49:08.360 you're uh and the the world's better
04:49:16.360 off yeah I'm not I'm not sure that the
04:49:19.480 world will be better off if I'm
04:49:21.480 richer but there's no question that I
04:49:24.638 mean and you know kind people and in the
04:49:28.798 end uh aspire to be
04:49:31.680 more or I'm sure many of you are
04:49:34.920 yourself but just inspired of me more so
04:49:37.798 and I guess we can take one more
04:49:38.958 question from Becky and then we've wind
04:49:40.360 up
04:49:42.638 uh this question comes from Devin
04:49:46.240 Spurgeon on March 4th Charlie's will was
04:49:49.600 filed with the County of Los Angeles the
04:49:52.360 first kodil kodil contained an unusual
04:49:55.200 provision it reads averaged out my long
04:49:58.680 life has been a favored one made better
04:50:00.958 by Duty imposed by family tradition
04:50:03.200 requiring righteousness and service
04:50:06.120 therefore I follow an old practice that
04:50:08.080 I wish was more common now inserting an
04:50:10.920 ethical bequest that gives priority not
04:50:13.360 to property but to transmission of Duty
04:50:16.558 if you were to make an ethical bequest
04:50:18.558 to Burkshire shareholders what duties
04:50:20.760 would you impose and
04:50:24.480 why I'd probably say read
04:50:27.280 Charlie I mean he's expressed it well
04:50:30.360 and uh I would well I would say that
04:50:34.920 that if they're not financially well
04:50:37.440 off uh if you're being kind you're doing
04:50:40.440 something something that most of the
04:50:41.360 rich people don't don't do when they
04:50:43.520 even when they give away money but uh uh
04:50:47.080 that's not a question when you're
04:50:48.360 whether you're rich or poor and uh and I
04:50:51.240 would uh I would say if you're lucky in
04:50:53.958 life make sure bunch of other people are
04:50:55.760 lucky
04:51:00.800 [Applause]
04:51:09.320 too okay
04:51:14.760 there's just in case you know what my
04:51:17.000 advice to myself would be has been
04:51:19.000 during this
04:51:19.670 [Laughter]
04:51:24.320 period so we only got 30 what three
04:51:27.400 questions or whatever it is but thank
04:51:29.440 you very very much for coming and I not
04:51:32.240 only hope that you come next year but I
04:51:33.920 hope I come next year
04:51:41.280 thank
04:51:48.878 you thank
04:51:51.320 you thank you
04:51:57.570 [Applause]
