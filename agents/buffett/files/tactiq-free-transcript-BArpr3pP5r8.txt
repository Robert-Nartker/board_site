00:00:00.080 by far the best investment you can make
00:00:01.520 is in yourself for example communication
00:00:03.439 skills I tell the students that they're
00:00:05.000 going to graduate schools and business
00:00:07.720 and they they're learning all these
00:00:09.040 complicated formulas all that if they
00:00:11.040 just learn to communicate better both in
00:00:13.360 writing and in person they increase
00:00:15.040 their value at least 50% it's just
00:00:17.039 hugely important and you if you invest
00:00:18.560 in yourself nobody can take it away from
00:00:20.680 you the second thing which you get
00:00:22.400 exactly one mind to one and one body in
00:00:24.920 this world and and you can't start
00:00:27.439 taking care of it when you're 50 by that
00:00:29.119 time you'll Rush the out if you haven't
00:00:30.679 done anything so just remember that you
00:00:32.479 just got one mind and body to get
00:00:34.160 through life with and to do the most
00:00:35.680 with it you know the most important
00:00:37.399 thing is really who you associate with
00:00:39.200 you want to associate with people that
00:00:40.280 are better than you are I mean basically
00:00:42.039 you'll go in the direction of the people
00:00:43.800 that you associate with and and you want
00:00:45.680 to have the right Heroes all you have to
00:00:47.399 do is just buy across section of America
00:00:49.800 and then ever listen to people like me
00:00:51.920 or read the papers or do anything
00:00:53.760 subsequently uh they think they think
00:00:56.120 that because you can trade you should
00:00:58.120 trade to be able to
00:01:00.879 Define which ones you can come to an
00:01:03.840 intelligent decision on and which ones
00:01:05.960 are Beyond Your Capacity to evaluate you
00:01:08.400 don't have to be right about thousands
00:01:10.080 and thousands and thousands of companies
00:01:12.119 you only have to be right about a
00:01:13.400 company I don't have to understand all
00:01:16.200 kinds of there's all kinds of business I
00:01:17.640 don't understand but there's thousands
00:01:19.640 of opportunities there I did understand
00:01:21.720 the Bank of America I'm able to do that
00:01:24.079 and it's a terrible mistake to think you
00:01:26.040 have to have an opinion on everything
00:01:27.759 you only have to have an opinion on a
00:01:30.119 few things in fact I've told students if
00:01:33.119 when they got out of school they got a
00:01:35.040 punch card with 20 punches on it and
00:01:37.680 that's all the investment decisions they
00:01:39.479 got to make in their entire life they
00:01:41.520 would get very rich because they would
00:01:43.280 think very hard about each one you don't
00:01:45.280 need 20 right decisions to get very rich
00:01:47.560 you know four or five will probably do
00:01:49.759 it over time if you have the right
00:01:51.560 philosophy you will find opportunities
00:01:54.520 as you go through the next 20 30 40 50
00:01:57.200 years if you got 160 IQ sell 30 points
00:02:00.479 to somebody else cuz you won't need it I
00:02:02.039 mean I figured out very early you don't
00:02:03.320 have to be that smart at this business
00:02:04.719 which is fortunate but you do have to
00:02:06.799 have the right temperament and you have
00:02:08.758 to be able to ignore what other people
00:02:11.560 are saying and and simply look at the
00:02:13.920 facts and decide is this stock which is
00:02:17.680 selling at X worth 2X and occasionally
00:02:21.040 you'll find things like that and if when
00:02:22.959 you don't find them you don't do
00:02:24.120 anything stock doesn't care what you
00:02:26.000 paid you have to remember the stock
00:02:28.440 doesn't even care that you own it you
00:02:30.200 are nothing to the stock that's that
00:02:33.080 stock is everything to you you know the
00:02:35.080 stock has no feelings about you the only
00:02:37.280 question with every stock every day and
00:02:40.000 you don't do it this frequently is can I
00:02:42.599 get more for my money someplace else
00:02:44.400 there is nothing about the price action
00:02:46.400 of the stock what tells you whether you
00:02:48.319 should keep owning it is what you expect
00:02:50.560 the company to do in the future versus
00:02:52.760 the price at which it's selling now
00:02:54.480 compared to the other opportunities of
00:02:56.599 businesses that you think you know
00:02:58.040 equally well and make that same
00:03:00.319 comparison and that's all there is to
00:03:01.599 owning stocks I don't worry about the
00:03:03.080 things that I miss that are outside my
00:03:05.200 circle of confidence of evaluating I do
00:03:08.879 I have missed things who were within my
00:03:10.799 circle and that's a terrible mistake you
00:03:13.480 don't want to get a hung up on trying to
00:03:15.599 make economic analysis because nobody's
00:03:17.799 any good at nobody you don't get rich
00:03:20.000 doing that we think we own all the stock
00:03:22.480 but the truth is before the tax cut the
00:03:24.440 government had a 35% share of the stock
00:03:27.159 on income now I didn't have a share of
00:03:29.319 the assets but had a share of the income
00:03:30.840 and if we had a private business if we
00:03:32.280 had a McDonald franchise together or an
00:03:33.959 auto dealership together the third
00:03:35.599 shareholder that invisible shareholder
00:03:37.519 the governor if you go back to one I
00:03:39.200 started my partnership in 1956 that
00:03:41.959 Berkshire came out of there were seven
00:03:43.680 people sitting there at a table I said
00:03:45.640 here's the partnership agreement it's
00:03:47.200 four or five pages you don't need to
00:03:48.760 read it but I said here's a little half
00:03:52.040 page what I call the ground rules and I
00:03:54.840 want you to read these and if you feel
00:03:57.560 okay about that about the internet
00:03:59.879 action what the expectations are and all
00:04:02.040 of that sort of thing then we'll join
00:04:03.879 forces and if you don't it's fine other
00:04:06.439 people have you know but we don't we
00:04:08.079 shouldn't be partners I mean if I'm
00:04:09.560 going to have a partnership with
00:04:10.519 somebody I want to be compatible it is
00:04:12.159 you know and when you have a public
00:04:14.360 company you can't control who comes in I
00:04:16.759 can't control some guy so by my actions
00:04:20.079 and my communications and everything I
00:04:22.280 want to attract the people from the
00:04:24.400 public market that I want and I want to
00:04:26.720 keep the others away Costco was built he
00:04:29.280 sat down and figured out the customer he
00:04:31.280 didn't want and he set up a system that
00:04:34.120 would keep away the customer he didn't
00:04:35.520 want who did he not want he didn't want
00:04:37.199 somebody buying a quart of milk with
00:04:39.039 somebody behind them with a with a
00:04:41.199 basket of $200 worth of goods waiting
00:04:43.160 for that if you're going to run a church
00:04:45.680 you want you want your seats to be
00:04:47.280 filled by people that are generally want
00:04:49.280 to listen to your form of religion and
00:04:51.960 if the market is falling or something
00:04:53.520 like that that's opportunity for us so
00:04:55.440 stock market has never caused my stomach
00:04:56.880 to turn you need emotional stability you
00:04:59.080 need to be able to detach yourself from
00:05:01.639 fear or greed when that prevails in the
00:05:04.080 market you've got to be able to come to
00:05:05.520 your own opinions and ignore other
00:05:07.120 people but you don't need a lot of
00:05:08.639 brains a stock is a piece of a business
00:05:11.400 if you buy a piece of a good business
00:05:13.000 and somebody's running it for you and
00:05:14.160 they're honest and able uh and you pay a
00:05:16.680 reasonable price you're going to make a
00:05:17.919 lot of money I don't need to know things
00:05:19.840 instantaneously I'm not making buy and
00:05:21.720 sell decisions based on instant news I'm
00:05:24.639 making them sometimes after I've looked
00:05:26.160 at a company for years and years he did
00:05:28.440 focus on the one thing he could change
00:05:31.120 and that was the customer's experience
00:05:33.440 the test isn't whether you get the
00:05:35.319 greatest business idea in the world the
00:05:37.840 first time out the test is whether you
00:05:40.479 keep learning as you go along what your
00:05:43.319 strengths are and what you can do for
00:05:45.080 your customers what you can bring
00:05:47.000 especially to the party you need the
00:05:49.520 education you need a genuine desire day
00:05:53.360 in you really do have to learn to
00:05:55.840 multiply yourself the key is to
00:05:59.080 certainly in terms of your personal life
00:06:01.400 the most important decision you may may
00:06:03.120 you'll make is is the spouse that most
00:06:06.400 of you will likely have and it's very
00:06:09.039 important to surround your people
00:06:10.800 yourself with people that are the better
00:06:12.280 than you are you are going to move in
00:06:14.440 the direction of the people you
00:06:16.800 associate with I advise you to seek out
00:06:19.960 as your partner in business your partner
00:06:21.680 in life whatever it may be look for the
00:06:24.440 people that actually are examples to you
00:06:28.000 rather than somebody that you need to
00:06:29.840 you think you need to straighten out
00:06:31.120 yourself and simple rules like that will
00:06:34.039 cause you to move in a better path I
00:06:36.199 said investing is just about assigning
00:06:38.080 yourself the right story I said imagine
00:06:39.960 Ben Bradley this morning said to you
00:06:41.880 what is the Washington Post company
00:06:43.560 worth what would you do if you have to
00:06:44.880 write the story in a month you'd go out
00:06:46.639 and interview TV Brokers and newspaper
00:06:48.759 Brokers and owners and you'd try and
00:06:50.800 value each asset I said that's what I do
00:06:53.080 I assign myself the right story I think
00:06:55.080 you should look for the job that you
00:06:57.000 would want to hold if you didn't need a
00:06:59.199 job I mean you're you're probably only
00:07:01.560 going to live once surely mclan May
00:07:03.280 differ with that or a few people but you
00:07:04.960 don't want to go sleepwalking through
00:07:06.479 life and you're really whether you make
00:07:08.720 X or 120% of X really isn't remotely as
00:07:12.400 important as to whether in most cases
00:07:14.560 you marry the right person and you also
00:07:16.800 find something that you would do if you
00:07:19.080 didn't need the money don't worry about
00:07:20.520 making the most money this week or next
00:07:23.160 month I mean when I went to offered to
00:07:25.520 work for Ben Graham I said I'll work for
00:07:27.039 nothing and I met it you know I mean
00:07:28.720 just the idea of being turned on you
00:07:30.400 need the right
00:07:33.080 orientation you know 90% of the people
00:07:36.120 I'm ping the figure out of the air but
00:07:37.560 90% of the people that buy stocks don't
00:07:40.520 think of them the right way they think
00:07:42.360 about something that they hope goes up
00:07:44.120 next
00:07:44.879 week and they think about the market is
00:07:47.080 something they hope goes up and if it's
00:07:48.759 down they feel worse I feel better the
00:07:50.639 company's going to be worth 10 or 20
00:07:52.199 years from now and I hope it goes down
00:07:53.840 when I buy it because I'll buy more you
00:07:55.599 got to be careful about what you compete
00:07:56.879 in it's good thing I don't have a
00:07:57.960 competitive spirit in chess
00:08:00.120 you know you know or football or like
00:08:02.479 that oh I just I'm I'm an observer there
00:08:05.800 I I enjoy watching things like that but
00:08:09.759 I I try to keep my competitive spirit in
00:08:12.000 a game where I can win I know I'll win
00:08:13.800 over time I mean a game is very very
00:08:16.800 very easy if you have the right lessons
00:08:19.080 in your mind about what you're buying
00:08:20.800 I'm not buying stocks I'm buying pieces
00:08:22.960 of overwhelmingly American Business I'm
00:08:25.800 happy when stocks are going down I'm
00:08:27.319 happier when stocks are going down
00:08:28.720 because I I I can buy more of them with
00:08:30.960 the same amount of money so you're
00:08:32.719 looking to say what can I do with the
00:08:34.880 money I've saved to put it away so I
00:08:38.039 feel good about getting it back later
00:08:40.240 under any circumstances but not
00:08:42.360 necessarily on a given moment people
00:08:45.120 would be so much better if they if they
00:08:47.399 actually didn't have a stock market in
00:08:49.640 terms of buying businesses and when
00:08:51.240 you're buying businesses don't don't
00:08:53.000 call them stocks there are times when
00:08:55.240 you get a chance to act and do something
00:08:57.320 really intelligent may may happen once
00:08:59.000 every 10 years for once every 20 years
00:09:01.279 depends on what field you're in where
00:09:02.720 you live what you know all of that the
00:09:05.040 first role in investment is don't lose
00:09:07.200 and the second rule of investment is
00:09:08.399 don't forget the first rule and that's
00:09:09.640 all the rules there are I mean that uh
00:09:11.399 if you buy things for Far Below what
00:09:13.160 they're worth and you buy a group of
00:09:14.760 them you basically don't lose money it's
00:09:16.399 a temperamental quality not an
00:09:17.640 intellectual quality you don't need tons
00:09:19.320 of IQ in this business I mean you have
00:09:20.839 to have enough IQ to get from here to
00:09:22.240 Downtown Omaha but uh but uh you do not
00:09:25.440 have to be able to play
00:09:26.200 three-dimensional chess or be in the top
00:09:28.640 leagues in terms of Bridge playing or
00:09:30.040 something of the sort you need a stable
00:09:32.880 personality you need a temperament that
00:09:35.000 neither derives great pleasure from
00:09:37.040 being with the crowd or against the
00:09:38.440 crowd you're not right or wrong because
00:09:40.800 a thousand people agree with you and
00:09:42.920 you're not right or wrong because a
00:09:44.079 thousand people disagree with you you're
00:09:45.519 right because your facts and your
00:09:46.640 reasoning are right
