# https://www.youtube.com/watch/LOpKTJXr658

00:00:00.000 i'd like to
00:00:01.439 talk to you about your financial future
00:00:02.879 and i hope those figures become
00:00:04.160 applicable to all of you as we go along
00:00:08.080 and i'd like to start
00:00:09.760 uh by posing a problem for you
00:00:12.160 and instead i'm just going to talk for a
00:00:13.679 couple minutes and we'll do q a because
00:00:15.759 what we want to do is talk about what's
00:00:16.960 on your mind but i'd like you to think
00:00:18.160 about this for just a second
00:00:20.720 if as we walked out of here today
00:00:24.160 i said i would like to buy
00:00:27.279 10 of your financial future
00:00:30.480 i was going to write you a check today
00:00:33.440 and
00:00:34.800 from this day forth
00:00:36.800 you were going to give me 10 of
00:00:38.480 everything you earned
00:00:40.960 how much would you want to charge me for
00:00:42.559 that
00:00:43.600 i'm gonna buy one tenth of you
00:00:46.480 and uh i may take the low bid
00:00:48.239 incidentally so be careful what you uh
00:00:50.719 right now well i think if you thought
00:00:52.399 about that a little while as you
00:00:54.559 you can contemplate that for a few
00:00:56.000 minutes you know you're gonna get a
00:00:56.960 check for me today
00:00:59.120 and you can do anything you want with
00:01:00.800 the money but
00:01:02.000 from this day forth you have to give me
00:01:04.479 10 of what you earn
00:01:06.799 i think it would be very foolish
00:01:08.960 of you
00:01:09.920 any of
00:01:10.840 you if you asked for less than say fifty
00:01:13.920 thousand dollars now it's gonna be a few
00:01:15.280 years before you're out earning money
00:01:17.119 and so i've got a few years of dead
00:01:18.560 money there but then i would start
00:01:19.680 getting this royalty on you as you went
00:01:21.280 along so
00:01:22.240 i really think that if you thought about
00:01:24.479 it
00:01:26.159 most of you would want a fair amount
00:01:27.920 more than that i think you'd be right
00:01:30.400 fortunately i didn't make this deal with
00:01:31.920 anybody when i started out so nobody's
00:01:34.079 got a 10 royalty on me but uh i think
00:01:37.040 that
00:01:38.079 50 000 would sort of be the absolute
00:01:40.079 minimum
00:01:41.520 and if you think about that
00:01:43.759 that means that right today
00:01:46.640 you are worth five hundred thousand
00:01:48.799 because of ten percent of you is worth
00:01:50.079 fifty thousand in cash today
00:01:53.200 your potential
00:01:55.119 is worth a minimum on 100 basis
00:01:58.159 of 500 000 that is the big financial
00:02:01.119 asset you've got it's way more important
00:02:04.719 what you do with that 500 000 asset that
00:02:07.520 you own today
00:02:09.679 then
00:02:11.360 whether you decide to buy stocks or
00:02:13.520 bonds or whether you put your money in a
00:02:15.520 mutual fund or pick your own stocks or
00:02:17.599 anything of that sort the biggest
00:02:19.360 financial asset
00:02:21.120 that you have going for you by miles
00:02:24.319 is the value of your own earning power
00:02:26.400 over the years so that's really what you
00:02:28.720 should focus on if you're focusing on
00:02:30.160 your financial future
00:02:32.400 that means you should finance focus on
00:02:34.480 you
00:02:35.519 because whether you're ten percent is
00:02:37.280 worth fifty thousand or a hundred
00:02:38.640 thousand or three hundred thousand
00:02:40.720 which would be five hundred thousand or
00:02:42.560 a million or three million for all of
00:02:44.160 you
00:02:46.000 whether it turns out to be one or the
00:02:47.920 other is really dependent
00:02:50.400 uh in a very large part on what you do
00:02:52.319 in the next few years
00:02:54.400 all of you in this room
00:02:56.560 have the brains to do extremely well in
00:02:58.720 life
00:02:59.760 you've all got the energy to do
00:03:01.040 extremely well in life and then the
00:03:02.800 question is how do you apply it
00:03:04.560 if you've got a 200 horsepower motor
00:03:06.959 you get 200 horsepower out of it you get
00:03:09.360 your full
00:03:10.480 potential or do you get 100 horsepower
00:03:12.319 or 50 horsepower
00:03:14.000 now there's two things that can
00:03:16.319 hold you back in getting the full
00:03:19.360 horsepower out of your your engine
00:03:21.360 whatever it may be all of you have big
00:03:22.640 enough engines
00:03:24.319 and one of those is a lack of education
00:03:26.640 but that probably isn't going to happen
00:03:27.840 to very many people in this room if you
00:03:29.680 did have a lack of education if you
00:03:31.599 didn't have a chance to get a decent
00:03:32.799 education in life it wouldn't make any
00:03:34.720 difference what that potential was
00:03:36.000 because
00:03:36.879 you'd never unlock it
00:03:38.480 but the second most important thing
00:03:40.959 and equally as important
00:03:43.040 is in terms of the habits that you
00:03:44.720 develop in terms of what you do with
00:03:46.000 yourself
00:03:47.519 when we
00:03:48.959 hire people we look for three qualities
00:03:52.239 we look for integrity we look for
00:03:54.319 intelligence and we look for energy
00:03:57.200 but if they don't have the first one
00:03:58.480 integrity the other two will kill you
00:04:01.120 because if you're hiring somebody
00:04:02.239 without integrity you really want to be
00:04:03.680 dumb and lazy don't you i mean you're
00:04:05.040 the last thing in the world you want
00:04:06.480 forms to be smart energetic so
00:04:08.560 smart and energetic only goes with
00:04:10.720 integrity
00:04:11.920 you know you make your own decision on
00:04:13.360 that you can't change
00:04:15.120 your iq or how far you control football
00:04:17.358 or how high you can jump or the color of
00:04:19.519 your hair very easily but you can
00:04:22.639 elect
00:04:24.080 to have integrity that matches anybody
00:04:25.840 else's and if you match that with
00:04:28.080 intelligence which you have and energy
00:04:30.080 which you have
00:04:31.440 uh you will get an extraordinary result
00:04:33.360 and you'd be very foolish to sell me 10
00:04:35.199 of yourself for 50 000. on the other
00:04:36.800 hand
00:04:37.759 if you don't match it with that your
00:04:39.120 potential will in a significant part go
00:04:41.600 unused
00:04:42.639 and i'll give you a little
00:04:45.280 simple test to apply in terms of
00:04:47.040 thinking about the kind of habits you
00:04:48.400 want to develop because you can have any
00:04:49.680 habits you want to be you can be you can
00:04:51.680 be lazy you can be prompt you can be you
00:04:54.000 can be
00:04:54.880 late you can be honest you can cut
00:04:56.560 corners i mean you have all these
00:04:57.919 choices
00:04:59.520 and those are choices for you to make
00:05:01.039 nobody else is going to make them for
00:05:02.320 you
00:05:03.199 and i would suggest that you play this
00:05:04.720 little game with me too
00:05:06.880 uh think about the person you would most
00:05:09.360 like to be in life
00:05:11.840 so maybe it's one of your contemporaries
00:05:13.360 maybe somebody a little older but pick
00:05:14.880 out the person you admire the most the
00:05:16.320 person you'd change places with if you
00:05:18.400 could
00:05:19.759 and then write down why you admire them
00:05:21.440 just put it on a piece of paper
00:05:23.759 and then figure out the person that you
00:05:25.440 would
00:05:26.320 least like to change places with who
00:05:28.400 really turns you off who do you find
00:05:30.400 repulsive
00:05:31.919 and list the reasons why
00:05:34.160 that person turns you off so much
00:05:36.800 and put those down on the other side of
00:05:38.080 the paper
00:05:39.360 and then look at that list
00:05:41.199 and you'll find that everything on the
00:05:42.479 left-hand side what you admire in other
00:05:44.400 people
00:05:45.600 the qualities they bring to life
00:05:47.759 um cheerfulness you know generosity all
00:05:50.960 kinds of things you'll find those are
00:05:52.560 things you can do yourself it's very
00:05:53.919 simple
00:05:54.960 you gotta apply yourself but the habits
00:05:56.800 you form and doing that early on will
00:05:59.280 carry you through life and on the other
00:06:01.199 hand you'll find that the things that
00:06:02.960 make people repulsive
00:06:04.720 selfishness obnoxiousness all these
00:06:06.560 things egotism
00:06:08.400 are things
00:06:09.759 that no one has to have if you find
00:06:11.520 those in yourself you can get rid of
00:06:12.880 them as long as you get rid of them
00:06:14.080 early so
00:06:15.360 all i suggest is that you write you
00:06:17.199 write down a list of what what you
00:06:18.840 admire what you find uh
00:06:21.280 contemptible
00:06:22.800 and decide that you know the ones on the
00:06:25.199 on the
00:06:26.319 at admired side are ones you're going to
00:06:28.800 acquire for yourself and if you do that
00:06:30.080 when you're young it'll carry you
00:06:31.280 through the rest of your life this
00:06:32.319 doesn't work if you do it when you're 50
00:06:35.039 or 60. by then the habits are too well
00:06:37.600 formed
00:06:39.039 uh but if you do it early
00:06:41.120 behavior becomes becomes a habit so
00:06:44.080 if you do that
00:06:46.080 two or three years from now if you go
00:06:47.280 through the same exercise
00:06:49.199 you'll find out the person you admire
00:06:50.639 the most is yourself
00:06:52.080 that can be a little dangerous under
00:06:53.280 some circumstances but it uh
00:06:55.680 but it's not it's not a bad thing i mean
00:06:57.280 you want to be somebody you like
00:06:59.440 and you don't want to be somebody that
00:07:00.800 you're that you dislike and and
00:07:03.840 form those habits early
00:07:06.400 you basically can't miss now i'll give
00:07:08.319 you one other small piece of advice
00:07:10.000 that's just a corollary on this
00:07:12.160 and then we'll get to your questions and
00:07:14.319 and that is as a general matters of one
00:07:17.440 piece of specific finance
00:07:19.840 financial advice
00:07:21.759 i would say you know avoid credit cards
00:07:24.160 just forget about them
00:07:25.840 uh we're in various businesses that
00:07:27.599 issue credit cards the american public
00:07:29.039 loves credit cards but if you start
00:07:30.479 revolving debt on credit cards you're
00:07:32.080 going to be paying
00:07:33.840 18 or 20 percent and
00:07:36.319 you can't make
00:07:38.240 progress in your financial life going
00:07:40.560 around borrowing money at 18 or 20
00:07:42.240 percent
00:07:43.440 you can make a lot of money by lending
00:07:44.800 it out at 18 or 20 over time you know if
00:07:48.080 you can find anybody that's good that
00:07:49.919 will borrow from you but you don't want
00:07:51.840 to be on the side of the equation
00:07:53.919 that's always behind in life
00:07:56.319 uh you know i was lucky i'd saved about
00:07:58.639 ten thousand dollars by the time i got
00:08:00.240 out of school that ten thousand dollars
00:08:01.919 was
00:08:03.440 really worth millions i might have
00:08:04.800 earned later on because after you get a
00:08:06.560 family and everything the expenses roll
00:08:08.400 in but but those were my tools to work
00:08:10.720 with but it was only because i was ahead
00:08:12.240 of the game if you're behind the game by
00:08:14.560 ten thousand dollars at some point and
00:08:16.160 paying eighteen or twenty percent
00:08:17.520 interest on it you will never you know
00:08:19.759 you'll never get out of it so the trick
00:08:22.639 i've got a partner that says
00:08:24.400 all i wanna know is where i'm going to
00:08:25.840 die so i'll never go there you know and
00:08:28.639 uh
00:08:29.520 and that's true in financial matters as
00:08:31.120 well you want to figure out where you
00:08:32.479 don't want to be
00:08:34.080 uh ahead of time and avoid that and i
00:08:35.839 get about a dozen letters a day
00:08:38.159 from people who are having terrible
00:08:39.599 problems
00:08:40.799 and there are two reasons why they have
00:08:42.399 terrible problems one is
00:08:45.040 a number of them have had health
00:08:46.320 problems of some sort i mean they have
00:08:47.839 really been hit by some or somebody in
00:08:49.440 their family has been hit by some kind
00:08:50.800 of catastrophic
00:08:52.399 illness and that is a you know it's a
00:08:54.320 terrible thing to happen to any family
00:08:56.480 and they get in
00:08:58.080 they run up bills they can't pay and and
00:09:00.000 really only society can solve that one
00:09:02.640 uh uh in terms of protecting people
00:09:05.120 against that that's just plain bad luck
00:09:07.920 but
00:09:08.720 the other one is from people who run up
00:09:10.399 credit card debt and
00:09:12.160 they're facing bankruptcy here they've
00:09:13.440 been through bankruptcy once before and
00:09:15.680 they owe a whole bunch of money and they
00:09:17.040 can't they can't pay the interest let
00:09:18.399 alone pay any principal
00:09:20.560 and half of my letters come from people
00:09:22.160 like that and that that that problem is
00:09:24.160 avoidable catastrophic illness is not
00:09:26.480 but but uh
00:09:27.920 credit card debt is something you bring
00:09:29.279 on yourself and
00:09:30.720 it's way better
00:09:32.480 it's way easier to stay out of trouble
00:09:35.040 than to get out of trouble financially
00:09:36.720 and and uh i will guarantee you if you
00:09:39.040 run a big credit card that you will be
00:09:40.560 in trouble
00:09:41.920 uh probably the rest of your life in
00:09:44.080 terms of uh your financial situation on
00:09:46.640 the other hand if you get ahead of the
00:09:47.839 game
00:09:48.959 uh even it's on a very modest scale
00:09:52.399 so that money is coming in from
00:09:54.320 investing
00:09:55.440 and you're you're
00:09:57.440 people owe you money or equities owe you
00:09:59.440 ownership
00:10:00.399 uh you'll be way ahead of the game
00:10:02.079 compared to paying it uh being always
00:10:04.560 being paying
00:10:05.600 your creditors every month so my advice
00:10:08.399 to you is uh
00:10:10.000 if you can't pay for it don't buy it and
00:10:12.320 uh get yourself in a position where you
00:10:14.000 can pay for anything and
00:10:15.680 then we'll be glad to see it borsheims
00:10:17.200 or nebraska furniture market
00:10:19.600 now let's uh
00:10:21.040 let's have some questions
00:10:22.720 do we have a mic out there that
00:10:24.959 people can either go to or that travels
00:10:26.560 around or
00:10:27.839 anything that's on your mind ask about
00:10:29.440 don't don't don't be bashful
00:10:32.320 yeah how would you advise people who
00:10:34.000 aren't necessarily going into a career
00:10:36.079 field in which you would make a
00:10:38.160 large base salary such as like medicine
00:10:40.640 or
00:10:41.519 something like that maybe
00:10:43.680 performing arts or
00:10:45.519 music
00:10:46.480 how would you advise us to
00:10:48.640 keep up financially with the rest of the
00:10:50.640 world
00:10:51.760 well
00:10:52.640 it is true
00:10:54.560 that a market system
00:10:56.640 does not pay as well in some in some
00:10:59.040 activities as
00:11:00.720 as might seem appropriate
00:11:03.279 for the importance of those activities
00:11:05.360 the society just take teaching for
00:11:07.120 example i mean teaching does not pay
00:11:08.720 well
00:11:09.600 and what could be more important i mean
00:11:11.920 you know you've got to be as
00:11:13.519 as interested in who you're
00:11:15.440 the teachers of your children are as who
00:11:17.200 your accountant is or you know whatever
00:11:19.920 or who's winning the heavyweight title
00:11:21.279 of the world or that sort of thing but
00:11:23.120 it doesn't pay well and and
00:11:25.839 it's a fundamental choice uh whether
00:11:28.640 you're going to go into something for
00:11:30.640 many people it'd be a fundamental choice
00:11:33.120 whether you're going to go into
00:11:33.920 something you love or something to to
00:11:35.760 try and make a lot of money i think that
00:11:38.000 generally it pays to go with what you
00:11:39.440 love
00:11:41.519 i think that
00:11:43.279 it's very hard to find people
00:11:45.440 when they get to be my age
00:11:47.760 who say they're on that they've loved
00:11:50.160 what they've done all their life and
00:11:51.360 feel was very worthwhile
00:11:53.200 but they're terribly sad they made that
00:11:54.720 choice because they didn't make a lot of
00:11:56.000 money i i don't think anybody's ever
00:11:58.320 ever said that to me that they wish
00:11:59.680 they'd gone into something else where
00:12:01.040 they were uncomfortable doing it or
00:12:03.040 didn't enjoy it didn't feel very
00:12:04.560 productive but made a lot of money so i
00:12:06.639 don't i don't think you'll find
00:12:08.480 that so i would i would i would go to
00:12:10.320 work
00:12:11.200 in whatever turns you on it may turn out
00:12:13.519 that it'll it'll be more profitable than
00:12:15.519 you can think but
00:12:17.120 almost everybody here will make
00:12:18.959 enough money unless they get some
00:12:20.880 terrible habits along the way
00:12:22.639 to do reasonably well and doing
00:12:24.720 reasonably well in this country
00:12:26.959 really is
00:12:28.480 is uh is pretty darn good i mean
00:12:31.279 it is
00:12:32.160 it's not necessary to have
00:12:34.320 uh huge amounts of money in order enjoy
00:12:36.560 yourself i enjoyed myself when i was at
00:12:38.560 my ten thousand dollars and i live in
00:12:40.560 the same house that i lived in when i
00:12:42.240 was making when i had about that i
00:12:43.839 bought it 41 years ago i like the house
00:12:46.079 then i like the house now i mean
00:12:48.880 if you think about it
00:12:50.639 if you have a reasonable job
00:12:52.959 you'll be eating at mcdonald's and i'll
00:12:54.399 be eating mcdonald's so we're we're to
00:12:56.079 push on on on food i mean you know in
00:12:59.200 fact i hope it's dairy queen actually
00:13:00.720 and
00:13:02.480 uh and if you come to dairy queen you'll
00:13:03.839 see me and you can order anything on the
00:13:05.279 menu i can order we both can afford it
00:13:07.760 uh
00:13:08.880 you know you'll you'll wear the same
00:13:10.639 clothes i wear i'll pay more for my
00:13:12.320 suits but as soon as i put them on they
00:13:13.600 look cheap on me so we'll look about the
00:13:15.360 same and
00:13:17.760 we'll both live in the same kind of
00:13:18.959 houses i live in that house from 41
00:13:20.639 years ago and it's it's it's warm in
00:13:22.480 winter and it's cool in summer and it's
00:13:24.000 comfortable
00:13:25.120 and you'll live in a house that's that's
00:13:26.880 similar and then and what difference
00:13:28.720 does it make if you have 50 more rooms
00:13:30.880 or you know guest houses or all that
00:13:32.959 you know it'll probably just bring you
00:13:34.160 problems i mean you have to worry about
00:13:35.519 the about the greenskeeper or something
00:13:37.760 when you get through so i i i have been
00:13:40.240 in the houses of people
00:13:42.079 uh where the houses are worth um
00:13:45.040 oh probably 200 times
00:13:47.440 uh what my house is worth and i would
00:13:49.680 not be any happier in those houses at
00:13:51.199 all in fact i'd be less happy i just
00:13:52.720 have one more thing to
00:13:54.320 to worry about and you know the
00:13:56.560 dozens of people around the place and
00:13:58.800 people quitting and people stealing from
00:14:00.399 you and all kinds of things to hell with
00:14:02.000 it now uh
00:14:04.560 we drive we'll drive the same kind of
00:14:06.160 car in fact you'll probably drive a
00:14:07.360 better car i drive our cars about eight
00:14:08.880 years old i don't know what it's worth
00:14:10.000 now but it gets me around fine i mean
00:14:12.240 i'm perfectly happy we'll watch
00:14:14.560 we'll watch the same television you know
00:14:16.800 we'll we'll work on the same computer
00:14:18.480 pretty much the only difference will be
00:14:21.360 how we travel long distances you know
00:14:24.079 i will
00:14:25.279 fly in a plane that's
00:14:26.800 more comfortable than
00:14:28.240 than flying southwest airlines or
00:14:29.680 something and which uh i've got nothing
00:14:31.519 against but that's the one real big
00:14:33.279 difference and other than that i do what
00:14:35.440 i like every day i hope you you'll do
00:14:37.040 what you like every day to do and i work
00:14:39.279 with nice people i hope you work with
00:14:40.560 nice people uh
00:14:42.399 and there's 24 hours in the day and
00:14:44.320 those are where the hours go so
00:14:46.880 great wealth
00:14:48.480 is the tiniest bit different
00:14:51.519 uh in a real sense than having just a
00:14:53.760 decent
00:14:54.880 a decent income and
00:14:57.040 and to trade
00:14:59.360 a decent income
00:15:01.440 and something you love doing and
00:15:02.800 something where you feel worthwhile
00:15:04.160 doing it
00:15:05.519 for
00:15:07.440 huge wealth where you trade off a lot of
00:15:09.600 your principles
00:15:10.959 uh would be a terrible mistake
00:15:13.839 would you not acknowledge your success
00:15:16.000 more on yourself or from the help and
00:15:17.920 teachings of others
00:15:19.680 well i had i had
00:15:21.680 i was very lucky in life
00:15:23.839 uh if you tell me who your heroes are i
00:15:26.480 i will
00:15:27.600 make a pretty good prediction about how
00:15:29.839 what you're going to do and i i i had
00:15:31.920 the right heroes i was very lucky in
00:15:33.600 life and uh my heroes never let me down
00:15:36.079 and started with my dad
00:15:37.839 and then i had others in business and
00:15:40.399 so i have had
00:15:42.320 great teachers some formal teachers some
00:15:44.959 that were just
00:15:46.959 informal teachers teachers by instinct
00:15:48.800 or example
00:15:50.079 and
00:15:51.440 if i hadn't had those
00:15:53.600 uh
00:15:54.399 you know my life i'm sure would have
00:15:55.839 been very different if i'd been born
00:15:57.199 anyplace else when i was i was born in
00:15:58.800 1930
00:16:00.079 uh and
00:16:02.079 at the time
00:16:04.399 one out of 50 births in the world were
00:16:06.800 in the united states so i came in
00:16:08.399 against 50 to 1 odds against being born
00:16:10.480 in the united states
00:16:11.759 i would have i would have been a
00:16:13.120 disaster you know if i'd been born in
00:16:14.720 afghanistan or
00:16:16.240 or peru or some place i mean i was
00:16:18.839 extraordinary today i was born you know
00:16:20.880 by being born in this country so have
00:16:22.320 you
00:16:23.279 uh i mean you you
00:16:26.240 the odds were probably 40 to 1 against
00:16:28.480 you being born in this country and that
00:16:30.639 were
00:16:31.519 five times more likely to have been born
00:16:33.040 in in china six times four or five times
00:16:35.759 more likely you've been born in
00:16:38.079 in india or some other place where it
00:16:39.839 would not have been as easy
00:16:41.519 to exploit the full potential of your
00:16:43.759 talent so we've all won the lottery in
00:16:45.839 that respect and and that's just plain
00:16:48.079 luck i mean it and i was lucky to be
00:16:50.959 born at this time i mean capital
00:16:52.399 allocation
00:16:53.759 is something
00:16:54.880 that pays off extremely well in the
00:16:56.720 society now but it doesn't pay off in
00:16:59.040 other societies and it didn't pay off
00:17:00.959 you know many years ago my my friend
00:17:02.560 bill gates says that if i was been born
00:17:04.640 a few thousand years ago i'd have been
00:17:06.079 some animals lunch you know
00:17:08.160 i i can't run very fast and i can't
00:17:10.400 climb trees and you know i just happen
00:17:12.720 those are talents
00:17:14.000 nobody asked me to climb trees now but
00:17:16.400 uh there was a time when it might have
00:17:18.079 been important and incidentally bill
00:17:19.919 would have been some animals breakfast i
00:17:21.439 mean he can't run so fast either but uh
00:17:24.240 in any event uh
00:17:26.240 you know
00:17:27.919 we are lucky i mean just imagine being
00:17:29.760 born a couple hundred years ago with
00:17:30.960 exactly the same talents and how far
00:17:32.480 they would have taken you then you know
00:17:34.000 the average person today lives so much
00:17:36.240 better than the richest person lived
00:17:38.799 100 or 150 years ago so
00:17:41.600 uh
00:17:42.640 i'm lucky in that respect lucky to be
00:17:45.280 born of terrific parents i was lucky to
00:17:47.760 be raised in omaha in a in a great
00:17:50.480 public school system i got a start here
00:17:52.960 in the first eight grades
00:17:54.960 that gave me a foundation that later
00:17:57.120 when i went off the track a few times uh
00:17:59.760 carried me through because i had a
00:18:01.360 terrific grade school education
00:18:03.440 in right here in omaha and rose hill and
00:18:05.679 one of the reasons
00:18:07.039 i had it incidentally is kind of
00:18:08.559 unfortunate but i had that great
00:18:10.000 education
00:18:11.200 uh in part
00:18:12.840 because women were being
00:18:15.520 enormously discriminated against and so
00:18:17.600 a woman at that time
00:18:19.360 could be a teacher she could be a
00:18:20.640 secretary she could be a nurse
00:18:22.799 you know and that was about it so he had
00:18:24.480 a half the talent pool in the united
00:18:26.320 states
00:18:27.520 limited to just a few jobs so you had an
00:18:30.080 abundance of talent
00:18:32.000 uh in those activities like nursing or
00:18:34.960 teaching because
00:18:36.240 uh that talent with males was spread
00:18:38.640 across every act every form of work
00:18:40.880 activity there was but with women it was
00:18:42.559 concentrated in a few areas and that
00:18:44.640 that benefited me it's kind of sad
00:18:46.000 because it didn't benefit those teachers
00:18:47.440 but but i was very lucky and
00:18:50.400 i've really been that way
00:18:52.320 uh all my life and what i do
00:18:55.440 is what i do is important as you know
00:18:57.280 what a good teacher does or a good nurse
00:18:59.039 does or something of the sort you know i
00:19:00.880 think that's quite questionable it pays
00:19:03.120 off enormously well in a market economy
00:19:05.280 like the united states and but that's an
00:19:07.600 accident didn't have any do any innate
00:19:09.760 ability of mine
00:19:12.400 mr buffett technology has been a great
00:19:15.039 factor in um stimulating the world
00:19:17.200 economy what are your predictions for
00:19:19.440 the future of the technology industry
00:19:22.400 and what what is its future role in
00:19:24.880 world economy and the united states
00:19:26.640 economy yeah well it's there's no
00:19:28.400 question it's turning the world upside
00:19:29.840 down it's it's done done it somewhat
00:19:32.320 already but
00:19:33.760 it will you know it's just beginning but
00:19:35.919 it's moving very fast i met gates on
00:19:39.280 july 15 1991 i was out there for a
00:19:42.080 fourth of july
00:19:43.679 uh
00:19:44.880 celebration with a friend and uh
00:19:47.840 who subsequently died in greenfield of
00:19:49.679 the washington post and she took us down
00:19:51.120 to visit the gates family
00:19:53.039 and
00:19:54.160 he tried to educate me about high tech
00:19:57.039 and he'd had better luck with
00:19:58.240 chimpanzees i mean i i was i was really
00:20:00.320 a disaster but but he's a good teacher
00:20:02.880 but one thing he told me was that
00:20:05.600 at the time he said you know you've got
00:20:07.600 this model in your head of the world
00:20:10.320 and your model
00:20:12.480 has
00:20:13.520 time and distance
00:20:15.360 as very limiting factors and he said
00:20:17.360 they aren't limiting factors anymore he
00:20:18.880 said you know the cost
00:20:21.120 of talking to somebody around the world
00:20:23.360 or getting your message in front of
00:20:24.880 somebody or publishing is it's going to
00:20:26.960 be zero and they're so close to zero it
00:20:29.039 doesn't make any difference you know
00:20:30.559 that was revolutionary
00:20:32.559 but it's happening already in a in a
00:20:34.720 very very big way and
00:20:36.799 it's just uh what eight years later
00:20:39.120 and and it's it's exploding so
00:20:43.679 high-tech
00:20:45.039 information technology whatever you want
00:20:46.480 to call it
00:20:48.000 is changing the world
00:20:49.679 and it's going to change it in a very
00:20:51.760 very big way it'll change i mean that's
00:20:53.520 one of the things i think about in
00:20:54.559 businesses we buy uh we announced the
00:20:57.120 purchase uh yesterday
00:20:59.200 of a uh furniture retailer in in in
00:21:01.760 boston in the boston area
00:21:03.760 and you know i think to myself what
00:21:05.760 effect does this new world have in terms
00:21:07.520 of the internet on furniture retail i
00:21:08.960 mean you have to think about questions
00:21:10.159 like that
00:21:11.280 the changes will be huge i will i played
00:21:13.600 bridge yesterday
00:21:15.360 uh with people
00:21:17.280 uh all over the country but i played it
00:21:18.960 with people all over the world i just
00:21:20.240 sit down on my computer and i've got
00:21:21.679 some popcorn there and i'm in khakis and
00:21:23.360 a sweater and i i can have a bridge game
00:21:25.440 in 30 seconds with people all over the
00:21:26.960 world and
00:21:28.240 no cost to it basically you know that's
00:21:30.720 a lot different than trying to arrange a
00:21:32.080 game with four people in omaha you know
00:21:33.760 on a day when one guy wants to play golf
00:21:35.840 another wants to watch baseball and i
00:21:37.600 mean it's it it just it changes things
00:21:40.240 in huge way
00:21:41.679 uh
00:21:42.640 we are very fortunate i mean it's
00:21:45.440 in the degree to which the united states
00:21:47.760 leads the world in this area i mean we
00:21:50.159 have a lead
00:21:51.520 it's hard to think of who's in second
00:21:53.039 place
00:21:53.919 and 15 or so years ago
00:21:56.080 this country had an inferiority complex
00:21:57.840 it'd be hard for you to remember because
00:21:59.039 you weren't old enough to be around them
00:22:00.640 but in the in the early 80s
00:22:02.880 we were wondering whether the germans
00:22:04.480 and the japanese were going to own
00:22:05.760 everything and that they were going to
00:22:07.200 make all the steel and they were going
00:22:08.320 to make all the cars
00:22:09.840 and everything else and the television
00:22:11.600 sets and we were going to flip
00:22:13.039 hamburgers that was the standard line
00:22:15.440 and just imagine in a short period like
00:22:17.840 15 years how that's changed around
00:22:20.400 in an important way that's changed
00:22:22.080 because of this
00:22:23.919 information uh a revolution uh where we
00:22:28.559 like i said i don't know who i don't
00:22:30.000 know who you would name as being in
00:22:31.280 second place in the world but here's the
00:22:32.720 most important industry in the world
00:22:34.720 and the united states has this
00:22:36.080 incredible position and we're moving all
00:22:38.400 the time with that position so
00:22:40.400 i think that
00:22:42.000 argues for a very
00:22:44.480 i think it argues for a terrific future
00:22:46.080 for the world over time and i think it
00:22:47.840 argues even more for a terrific future
00:22:50.159 for this company a country
00:22:54.240 what are the best ways for youth to get
00:22:56.000 started now in securing their financial
00:22:57.840 future
00:22:59.280 for
00:23:00.159 for what to secure their financial
00:23:01.360 future
00:23:03.120 for you youth oh well it's not it's not
00:23:06.000 very complicated
00:23:07.600 it goes back to
00:23:10.240 getting full use out of your own talents
00:23:12.159 first
00:23:13.280 i mean the difference between whether
00:23:14.480 you're going to be earning x or 2x or 3x
00:23:17.120 a year
00:23:19.039 20 years from now
00:23:21.600 is going to be a function
00:23:23.360 of how well not how much talent you have
00:23:25.760 but how how well you use the talents you
00:23:27.760 already have
00:23:29.120 and uh so that is
00:23:31.200 the your best financial future
00:23:33.760 is your own ability and and
00:23:36.720 and your
00:23:39.039 uh a capacity to
00:23:41.760 to use those abilities to their
00:23:43.520 potential
00:23:44.799 and
00:23:45.679 they can't take that can't be taken away
00:23:47.279 from you they can't even tax it
00:23:49.440 i mean uh you know most things if if you
00:23:52.400 wanna you know a piece of real estate if
00:23:54.240 they double the taxes they double the
00:23:55.520 taxes and that changes your ownership in
00:23:57.919 the property because now in effect the
00:23:59.520 taxing authorities own more of it
00:24:01.039 because they've got a greater command on
00:24:02.720 the revenue stream uh the same thing
00:24:04.640 about
00:24:05.520 uh almost any asset you have uh
00:24:08.320 but
00:24:09.440 they they don't tax what's in your head
00:24:12.000 and they don't tax
00:24:13.440 your ability to
00:24:14.960 start performing when you when you get
00:24:16.799 to work in the morning and finish in the
00:24:18.720 evening
00:24:19.840 to to your potential one of the things
00:24:21.760 that amazes me
00:24:23.440 is how people who really do perform well
00:24:25.919 just sort of jump out at you once you're
00:24:27.600 running a business when i got out of
00:24:28.799 school i thought you know everybody
00:24:31.200 would behave that way but they don't
00:24:32.720 most people sort of go
00:24:35.120 go through life in a sleepwalk and
00:24:37.600 and it if you don't
00:24:39.919 you will stand out so
00:24:41.840 the big the biggest thing for your
00:24:43.279 financial future is yourself now
00:24:45.440 beyond that it is always being ahead of
00:24:47.600 the game rather than getting behind the
00:24:49.039 game it's saving a little no matter how
00:24:50.640 you do it i mean i delivered papers i
00:24:52.480 worked at pennies i sold golf balls i
00:24:54.320 had a pinball machine round i did a lot
00:24:55.679 of things
00:24:56.799 that enabled me to accumulate about ten
00:24:58.960 thousand dollars by the time i got out
00:25:00.400 of school
00:25:01.440 uh
00:25:02.799 10 000 doesn't go as far now as it did
00:25:04.559 then but it
00:25:05.679 having anything so that you're ahead of
00:25:07.760 the game and not getting behind the game
00:25:10.240 is enormously important i mean just
00:25:12.400 you know if you're gonna run 100
00:25:14.559 yard dash against a bunch of people in
00:25:16.559 life
00:25:17.760 if you can figure it out so that when
00:25:19.360 the gun goes off you're 10 or 15 yards
00:25:21.200 ahead
00:25:22.159 instead of 10 or 15 yards behind it's
00:25:23.760 going to make an enormous difference in
00:25:25.120 how that race comes out so
00:25:27.039 uh
00:25:28.559 having having some net
00:25:30.799 resources
00:25:32.159 doesn't make much difference whether
00:25:33.120 they're in stocks or bonds in my view
00:25:34.720 but uh
00:25:35.919 and not having debt
00:25:37.679 when that gun goes off when you get out
00:25:39.200 of school
00:25:40.880 is a huge plus over being behind the
00:25:42.880 game and uh
00:25:44.320 uh
00:25:45.200 you know
00:25:46.240 it may come from delivering a paper out
00:25:47.919 in the morning it may come from
00:25:48.960 part-time work someplace but
00:25:50.960 but put aside a few dollars for yourself
00:25:53.200 but
00:25:54.320 uh so that when the time comes and you
00:25:57.039 enter
00:25:57.840 you enter the workforce uh you're ahead
00:26:00.159 of the game and not behind and then once
00:26:01.760 you get there don't get behind by buying
00:26:03.520 a whole lot of things that you figure
00:26:05.200 you're going to pay for some day while
00:26:06.480 you're paying 20 interest in between
00:26:09.279 i was wondering with the increasing
00:26:11.120 costs of education today what can
00:26:13.840 students do to deal with their debts
00:26:15.360 once they're out of college
00:26:18.159 well that's a tough one i mean i guess
00:26:20.320 i'd pay it off as fast as i could and i
00:26:22.000 would incur as little debt as as
00:26:23.840 possible in before that time came and i
00:26:26.400 would say this
00:26:27.679 in my experience
00:26:29.919 in business
00:26:31.120 there is very little difference
00:26:34.000 if any
00:26:35.039 between a very high priced business
00:26:36.720 education and what's available a lot for
00:26:39.840 a lot less money so i i
00:26:42.320 i went to the university of nebraska at
00:26:44.320 lincoln
00:26:45.279 my last year in college i went to
00:26:46.960 wharton for a couple years before that
00:26:50.000 i learned just as much at the university
00:26:51.360 of nebraska as i did at wharton uh
00:26:54.480 and there's nothing against wharton i
00:26:56.240 mean it's just me we had a very good
00:26:57.520 school here i had some terrific
00:26:58.640 professors at lincoln
00:27:00.480 and so i i would not assume
00:27:03.440 that if i was paying a few thousand
00:27:04.880 dollars for an education
00:27:06.799 uh here in the state for example versus
00:27:09.520 paying huge amounts elsewhere
00:27:12.159 that it was going to make a lot of
00:27:13.520 difference uh
00:27:15.360 most of a lot of the education
00:27:18.399 uh and you need to be prodded in the
00:27:20.240 right direction but an awful lot of it
00:27:21.520 is is itself
00:27:23.200 is self-taught done
00:27:25.279 uh
00:27:26.240 i mean andrew carnegie did a wonderful
00:27:27.760 thing in this country in terms of
00:27:28.960 libraries and i used to spend a lot of
00:27:30.720 time at libraries i can get locked in at
00:27:32.799 the university of omaha one what was
00:27:34.159 then the university of omaha and they
00:27:35.440 had
00:27:36.159 i couldn't get out for hours and one
00:27:38.240 night i got so entranced with what i was
00:27:39.840 reading but it
00:27:41.600 there's there's all kinds of information
00:27:43.760 available now with the internet it's so
00:27:45.200 much you know easier than it was then so
00:27:47.760 uh it's out there to be taken
00:27:50.480 and
00:27:51.360 it isn't necessary to pay
00:27:53.440 30 or 35 000 a year to go to some
00:27:57.200 big name school
00:27:58.640 to get the education at all i mean if
00:28:01.120 you're going to learn accounting if
00:28:02.240 you're going which is probably the most
00:28:03.760 important course you'd take in business
00:28:05.520 if you're going to learn account you can
00:28:06.480 learn accounting absolutely as well
00:28:08.799 in my view going to you and always going
00:28:10.480 to
00:28:11.200 harvard i mean i see
00:28:13.440 i bet on that and
00:28:15.200 i wouldn't run up
00:28:17.520 huge bills
00:28:19.360 in terms of getting a business education
00:28:20.799 now you know if you're going to get a
00:28:21.840 medical education
00:28:23.279 i mean there's certain professions where
00:28:25.279 there may not be any way around
00:28:27.600 spending a fair amount of money and
00:28:28.880 getting in debt to some degree you've
00:28:30.880 got to make that decision yourself but
00:28:32.320 i'd certainly try to minimize it
00:28:34.480 and uh
00:28:36.159 and i would sort of i would have it
00:28:37.520 figured out
00:28:38.640 how i would handle that debt in say a
00:28:41.360 five-year period after i got out of
00:28:42.880 school or i would think twice about
00:28:44.159 incurring it
00:28:45.840 what advice would you have for a forming
00:28:47.679 non-profit organization
00:28:49.679 for forming a non-profit organization
00:28:52.080 well i've always tried to avoid forming
00:28:53.520 non-profit organizations
00:28:57.039 uh well that would that would depend
00:28:59.360 entirely on what i wanted to accomplish
00:29:01.120 i mean it you know it'd be one thing it
00:29:03.039 was a hospital it could be another thing
00:29:04.960 uh you know
00:29:06.559 there's a there's so many types of it so
00:29:08.799 i you know you've got to get people that
00:29:10.720 are
00:29:11.520 that are experienced and involved
00:29:14.159 uh
00:29:15.440 in an entity like that and uh
00:29:18.080 but it depends so much on the on the
00:29:20.480 objective uh
00:29:22.080 you're working at uh
00:29:24.640 i understand that you're very civically
00:29:26.159 involved and i was wondering how
00:29:27.520 important of a quality you think that is
00:29:29.200 for an individual in life and why
00:29:31.679 yeah well i wouldn't say that i am that
00:29:33.440 i mean i i do certain civic things i
00:29:35.120 think i think
00:29:36.320 your model as a citizen for example in
00:29:38.320 online would be walter scott i mean he
00:29:39.919 is far more civically involved than i am
00:29:42.960 and uh incidentally his predecessor
00:29:45.039 peter kiewit was too but walters carried
00:29:46.960 it to new heights so i uh i don't want
00:29:49.360 to
00:29:50.320 take
00:29:51.279 uh on any mantle for that myself i do
00:29:53.440 some things uh
00:29:55.039 one of the problems i have is i love
00:29:56.320 what i do so much that
00:29:58.320 that it sort of takes over i mean i'm
00:30:00.080 like a guy that likes to play a lot of
00:30:02.240 golf or something except i like i like
00:30:03.840 the business i'm in but
00:30:06.159 uh i've got a family that participates
00:30:08.640 very actively uh uh some of my children
00:30:12.240 work on almost anything that comes along
00:30:14.399 in the civic area and
00:30:16.240 you know it's
00:30:17.520 you do
00:30:19.039 in the end people do what they want to
00:30:20.480 do to quite a degree and and uh
00:30:24.159 i think
00:30:25.279 i've never talked to anybody that
00:30:27.360 that enjoyed working in civic activities
00:30:29.840 that didn't feel was very worthwhile
00:30:32.240 after they've done i mean they've built
00:30:33.360 something and participating in building
00:30:35.200 something is always
00:30:36.720 a lot of fun and actually you have a
00:30:38.480 good time we have this golf tournament
00:30:39.760 for example in
00:30:41.039 september and we raise some money for
00:30:43.279 something but everybody has a good time
00:30:44.559 so nobody's paying any price by doing it
00:30:46.799 i'm having a good time the people who
00:30:48.080 come are having a good time
00:30:49.600 and uh we get to show all more off to
00:30:51.600 people
00:30:52.559 but
00:30:53.440 you should be enjoying things that go
00:30:54.880 along and you will if you work in civic
00:30:57.039 activities that that
00:30:59.200 that interest you and you can do the
00:31:00.640 same thing in politics i mean
00:31:02.799 if you find political ideas or
00:31:06.480 or politicians who particularly
00:31:08.799 uh
00:31:09.760 you identify with turning on you can get
00:31:11.440 a lot of self satisfaction out of out of
00:31:13.840 working and you're doing something
00:31:15.039 worthwhile so i
00:31:16.720 just just follow your instincts on that
00:31:18.399 that'd be my recommendation
00:31:21.120 i have question what do you see as the
00:31:23.279 problem the biggest economic problem
00:31:25.519 facing
00:31:27.039 the youth of today going into the future
00:31:30.320 yeah i don't think you that
00:31:34.159 you're going to have enormous economic
00:31:35.760 problems i think you will live in a
00:31:37.360 society
00:31:39.120 where the average person
00:31:41.279 uh lives better
00:31:43.200 by a significant margin
00:31:45.200 than the average one of a generation
00:31:47.200 earlier or two generations earlier
00:31:48.720 that's been the history of this country
00:31:49.919 it's a marvelous country that way i mean
00:31:52.399 it when you think of it we have four and
00:31:53.840 a half percent of the world's population
00:31:56.240 you know and and what's been
00:31:58.080 accomplished here is incredible 53
00:32:00.000 percent of the
00:32:01.360 of the value of corporations that are
00:32:04.320 publicly traded in the world exist in
00:32:06.159 the united states with four and a half
00:32:07.440 percent of the population this country
00:32:09.519 always
00:32:10.640 has done well uh
00:32:12.799 they say in stocks
00:32:14.399 that you should buy stock in a business
00:32:16.080 that's so good that even an idiot can
00:32:17.919 run it because sooner or later one will
00:32:20.000 and and
00:32:21.279 that's not terrible advice well that
00:32:22.640 seems to have been sort of the history
00:32:24.159 of this country from time to time i mean
00:32:25.600 we've
00:32:26.799 we've had all these problems that have
00:32:28.640 come along if you look back in the last
00:32:30.080 hundred years and list all the problems
00:32:31.600 those countries run into you know you
00:32:33.200 make a very long list and a lot of
00:32:34.559 people who focused on those problems at
00:32:36.399 the time have missed the bigger picture
00:32:38.720 and the bigger picture
00:32:40.240 is that every generation was better than
00:32:41.840 the one before
00:32:43.279 and that's because of uh
00:32:45.200 that's because of
00:32:46.720 savings because savings enable people
00:32:49.440 to create new tools to do better things
00:32:51.519 as they go along and it's also
00:32:53.279 due to an environment
00:32:55.120 that lets people realize their potential
00:32:58.000 to a greater degree than most other
00:32:59.760 environments in the world it's far from
00:33:01.519 perfect i mean it's it's sad how far it
00:33:03.840 is from perfect but it is better than
00:33:05.919 anything else
00:33:07.279 around i mean in this country uh you've
00:33:10.240 got
00:33:11.120 you don't have some commissar or
00:33:12.799 something running a
00:33:14.559 you know a big business in this country
00:33:16.399 you've got a guy like jack welch and a
00:33:18.320 fellow like jack welch makes
00:33:20.240 a difference of night and day
00:33:22.720 in terms of the productivity of that
00:33:24.320 business over a period of decades and
00:33:26.480 productivity is what a
00:33:28.159 is what causes the standard of living to
00:33:29.840 rise so anything that a system that
00:33:32.080 throws up the jack welch's of the world
00:33:33.840 to run businesses
00:33:35.279 is going to have an enormous advantage
00:33:37.200 over a society that does it by heredity
00:33:39.760 or that does it by government edict
00:33:42.159 and we've got
00:33:43.440 we're closer to that society
00:33:45.519 that i've described than than anything
00:33:47.760 than any other country and it's
00:33:50.000 it's led to great things and it will
00:33:52.000 continue to lead to great things so i
00:33:53.519 think i think you've got the best future
00:33:56.399 uh you know you don't face you don't
00:33:58.000 face a war
00:33:59.519 and you've got a you you've got a a
00:34:01.679 great
00:34:02.880 uh you've got a better future in terms
00:34:05.360 of achieving material rewards than any
00:34:08.879 generation in history so
00:34:10.879 i wish i could trade you places
00:34:13.440 i was wondering if you or if you could
00:34:15.839 speak for mr gates were afraid of
00:34:18.399 the impact on y2k on the economy or
00:34:20.960 specifically the stock market yeah well
00:34:22.719 i'm i'm i'm glad you gave me a chance to
00:34:24.960 bring in other people because i i'm the
00:34:26.480 last guy in the world understanding
00:34:28.079 about y2ki you know i don't know why
00:34:29.839 this microphone's working i don't know
00:34:31.280 you know why lights go on
00:34:32.800 i i flip on the switch of my television
00:34:34.879 set and pray i mean it's all
00:34:37.040 it's all beyond me but
00:34:38.960 i would say this the smartest people i
00:34:40.719 know in that area
00:34:42.719 uh in large part think it's going to be
00:34:44.960 a non-event it
00:34:46.839 uh in this country i don't i can't speak
00:34:49.918 for the rest of the world but uh uh so i
00:34:52.560 think uh
00:34:54.000 i think you'll wake up on
00:34:56.239 january
00:34:57.520 first and find the world hasn't changed
00:34:59.520 from december 31st now i would say this
00:35:01.920 you might you might get a whole bunch of
00:35:03.280 friends to write your checks for a
00:35:04.400 billion dollars on december 31st and
00:35:06.240 deposit them and you know who knows
00:35:07.920 what'll happen can't lose anything i
00:35:09.280 mean i'm not going to do his bounce and
00:35:10.880 if the system gets followed up you know
00:35:13.040 you might find a lot of money in your
00:35:14.240 account but i wouldn't count on it then
00:35:16.800 wait we have a
00:35:18.079 we own a company called executive jet
00:35:20.160 we have about 14 or 1500
00:35:22.640 uh customers who own pieces of airplanes
00:35:24.720 with us and we so we've got a hundred
00:35:26.079 and
00:35:27.119 well we got 160 of their planes and some
00:35:29.119 of our own flying around it'll be very
00:35:30.720 interesting to me to see
00:35:32.560 what the
00:35:33.760 advance people let us know ahead of time
00:35:35.760 when they want to use it it'll be very
00:35:37.200 interesting to see how many
00:35:38.560 sign up for
00:35:39.760 january 1st at
00:35:41.359 1201 but
00:35:43.359 it wouldn't bother me to fly him in the
00:35:44.880 least on january 1st or do anything else
00:35:47.440 on january 1st
00:35:49.440 ideally i hope the getting prepared to
00:35:51.200 watch the huskers play in
00:35:53.280 the big game
00:35:55.599 and i was wondering how do you decide
00:35:57.200 what you invest your time and money in
00:36:00.079 yeah well i i i like to find
00:36:04.480 businesses that have good economics now
00:36:06.240 what what are good economics well good
00:36:07.760 economics are a business that has
00:36:10.000 some kind of a moat around it
00:36:12.640 that makes its product or its service or
00:36:15.280 its location or something
00:36:17.119 a little more
00:36:18.480 desirable than to the customer than any
00:36:20.640 other sort of comparable product you
00:36:22.560 know the number one candy bar in the
00:36:24.160 last 30 or 40 years has been snickers
00:36:26.720 people don't fool around with different
00:36:28.400 candy bars they fool around with
00:36:30.480 different
00:36:31.440 length dresses they flew around you know
00:36:33.200 with all kinds of things but they don't
00:36:34.480 fool around with candy bars because they
00:36:36.480 figure you know they're going to go in
00:36:37.359 and lay out 50 cents or whatever it is
00:36:38.800 and put it in their mouth and
00:36:40.480 they're not going to for 50 cents and
00:36:42.079 putting in your mouth i mean you're not
00:36:43.200 going to say i'll i'll put in lay out 45
00:36:45.920 cents and put something else in my mouth
00:36:47.440 so you find that very stable
00:36:50.160 and we like businesses that we think we
00:36:52.720 can figure out where they're going to be
00:36:54.079 in 10 or 15 years i don't know where the
00:36:56.240 information technology businesses are
00:36:57.760 going to be in 10 or 15 years i know
00:36:59.280 where snickers bars are going to be in
00:37:00.560 10 or 15 years they're going to be
00:37:01.680 selling just about you know the way they
00:37:03.119 do now i know where wrigley's gum is
00:37:04.960 going to be in 10 or 15 years there's
00:37:06.720 not going to be a lot of innovation
00:37:08.640 in in chewing them and people the
00:37:10.800 internet's not going to cause people to
00:37:12.000 quit chewing gum either i mean at least
00:37:13.760 i mean gates may think so but i don't
00:37:15.280 think so
00:37:16.240 but
00:37:17.200 it's predictability
00:37:19.680 regarding the sustainability of a
00:37:21.440 competitive advantage some something
00:37:23.280 special about a product so we look for
00:37:25.119 those kind of products and then we look
00:37:26.960 for people that are running the business
00:37:28.960 that are honest
00:37:30.160 and able
00:37:31.520 it's easier to find people that are
00:37:32.880 honest and able than it is to find
00:37:34.640 businesses that are going to stay
00:37:36.880 wonderful for a long period of time
00:37:39.119 there are a lot of business that looked
00:37:40.400 like they were going to stay wonderful
00:37:41.599 but really evaporated over time but
00:37:43.839 that's what we're looking for and the
00:37:45.599 nice thing about is we don't have to
00:37:46.560 find very many if we find one a year
00:37:49.280 that's terrific
00:37:50.880 because you don't you don't need a
00:37:52.720 hundred or a thousand great investment
00:37:54.560 ideas to do well
00:37:56.480 you need a couple
00:37:57.760 and
00:37:59.520 if we the discipline
00:38:01.680 is the most important thing we don't
00:38:03.280 need brain power
00:38:04.720 we need discipline
00:38:06.640 you don't need 150 iq to do what i do
00:38:09.200 thank god you know you don't need 140
00:38:12.079 you know 135 you may need 115 or
00:38:14.560 something like that and
00:38:16.160 and but you do need discipline you have
00:38:18.720 to wait until you see the fat pitch to
00:38:21.280 swing at
00:38:22.480 because investing is a no-call strike
00:38:25.119 game you know if i were a baseball
00:38:26.640 player and i only like pitches
00:38:29.280 two inches above my navel
00:38:31.200 you know some guy could learn that and
00:38:32.720 he could pitch me you know three or four
00:38:34.400 inches below that and i get called out
00:38:35.760 on strikes because i never find a pitch
00:38:37.280 i like you can get call out on strikes
00:38:39.440 in baseball you have to swing at pitches
00:38:41.760 that you you don't even necessarily like
00:38:44.160 particularly after the count gets to two
00:38:45.680 strikes
00:38:47.200 in business
00:38:48.320 you don't have to swing on anything you
00:38:49.680 can sit there and
00:38:50.960 the paper says general motors at 68 or
00:38:53.040 it says general electric at 115 or so
00:38:55.200 general dynamics at 63.
00:38:57.839 and if you don't like those prices you
00:38:59.040 don't have to swing you can wait there
00:39:00.560 day after day after day after day and
00:39:02.560 there are no called strikes
00:39:04.720 now when you swing when you decide to
00:39:06.720 buy something
00:39:08.000 then you know if you swing and miss it's
00:39:09.359 a strike but
00:39:10.480 it's a marvelous game to be in because
00:39:12.160 there are no called strikes and you can
00:39:14.240 simply wait for that one time
00:39:17.280 in a month or six months or a year or
00:39:19.680 two or three years when you really know
00:39:21.680 what you're doing where you like the
00:39:22.880 price or you like the people running the
00:39:24.320 business
00:39:25.359 and then you swing and you only need a
00:39:26.720 few swings in your lifetime
00:39:28.880 so that's the way we try to pick
00:39:30.079 businesses we try to stay with things we
00:39:32.160 understand
00:39:33.359 i mean there can be all kinds of
00:39:35.119 wonderful investment opportunities out
00:39:37.040 there that i don't understand i don't
00:39:38.800 know what cocoa beans are going to do
00:39:40.079 next year you know maybe you know but i
00:39:41.680 don't know i i don't know what i don't
00:39:43.599 know what uh crude oil is going to sell
00:39:45.280 for
00:39:46.160 but
00:39:47.200 i don't have to know
00:39:48.720 i just have to know the things i have to
00:39:50.720 know what i know
00:39:52.000 i have to know where the limits of my
00:39:54.480 understanding are what i call
00:39:57.119 what my circle of competence is
00:39:59.280 and if i'm only able to evaluate five
00:40:01.119 percent of the businesses in the world
00:40:03.599 no problem i just stay within that five
00:40:05.200 percent and try and find something
00:40:07.119 uh and that's most people get in trouble
00:40:09.359 because
00:40:10.560 in investments because they
00:40:13.040 well they get itchy you know they can't
00:40:14.400 discipline themselves and they hear
00:40:15.920 about other people making money nothing
00:40:17.599 upsets people so much as to hear about
00:40:18.960 their friends making money i mean it's
00:40:20.800 that that's very destructive to
00:40:22.400 discipline because they think i'm smart
00:40:24.000 on that guy next door and he just just
00:40:25.599 bought that new car with the money made
00:40:27.040 trading stocks on the internet so why
00:40:28.720 can't i well the answer is you can't
00:40:30.800 overcome time you will lose money to
00:40:32.400 trade stocks actively
00:40:34.079 and uh
00:40:36.000 it's it's hard to exercise the
00:40:37.359 discipline
00:40:38.800 but anytime you buy something
00:40:40.800 you should be able to take out a
00:40:42.800 one-page sheet of paper
00:40:44.960 and say i'm buying general motors it's
00:40:47.040 65. i'm buying general electric 150
00:40:50.000 because
00:40:51.440 and you should write down the reasons if
00:40:53.440 you can't you can't fill out the sheet
00:40:55.440 if it's because somebody told me about
00:40:56.640 it at a cocktail party last night that's
00:40:58.160 not good enough
00:40:59.280 if it's because my broker told me about
00:41:00.640 it that's not good enough
00:41:02.480 yeah it's uh you've got to have a reason
00:41:05.839 for thinking that it makes an
00:41:06.960 intelligent investment you do the same
00:41:08.400 thing if you're buying a farm or an
00:41:09.839 apartment house if you're buying a farm
00:41:11.359 you'd say i'm buying this farm with a
00:41:13.200 thousand dollars an acre because i think
00:41:14.640 i can earn 60 an acre on it if corn
00:41:17.359 cells and such and such and soybean
00:41:18.880 cells and such and such and yield as
00:41:20.480 such and such and you'd figure it out
00:41:22.960 that's the same reason you buy
00:41:24.960 businesses and when you buy stocks
00:41:26.480 you're buying a little piece of a
00:41:27.760 business
00:41:28.800 and that's probably the most important
00:41:30.000 thing to remember in investing is that
00:41:32.480 when you're buying a stock you're buying
00:41:34.000 a little piece of the business and
00:41:35.680 if you are buying it at an attractive
00:41:37.599 price for the business for the whole
00:41:38.880 business you're going to make money and
00:41:40.960 if you aren't
00:41:42.160 you know over time you won't make money
00:41:45.680 um reverend jackson jesse jackson talked
00:41:47.680 to us earlier he seemed to believe that
00:41:49.440 the moral standards of today's society
00:41:51.839 will eventually affect us in business
00:41:53.920 how do you feel this will affect us as
00:41:55.760 youth growing up in the united states
00:41:57.280 well i think
00:41:58.960 very difficult to
00:42:00.960 quantify
00:42:02.800 moral standards over time i mean that
00:42:05.520 you know you could you could pick out
00:42:07.280 huge weaknesses at any given time in
00:42:09.520 terms of how
00:42:10.960 people or the country is behaving and
00:42:12.800 and and huge strengths so i think it's
00:42:15.520 enormously difficult to quantify
00:42:17.920 uh i think
00:42:19.440 by and large we have made
00:42:21.839 progress in what i would call
00:42:23.240 institutionalized moral standards
00:42:25.839 in this country
00:42:27.119 i mean the the the
00:42:29.280 uh you know in terms of slavery in terms
00:42:31.599 of the uh in terms of i mean the women
00:42:33.839 women couldn't vote you know a century
00:42:35.359 ago
00:42:36.480 half the country were second-class
00:42:37.839 citizens in that respect in a very and
00:42:39.920 they had much lesser rights in terms of
00:42:41.839 inheritance and all kinds of things the
00:42:43.839 income tax
00:42:45.440 didn't exist
00:42:46.960 a hundred years ago so the idea of
00:42:48.640 taxing people according to
00:42:50.720 to how much that they benefited from
00:42:53.280 society and their income
00:42:55.280 uh didn't exist so i think in terms of
00:42:58.079 institutionalized moral standards
00:43:00.720 the country has made
00:43:02.560 really quite significant progress uh
00:43:05.280 in the in the last hundred years i think
00:43:07.040 you know there's an enormous distance to
00:43:09.440 go i think we're going in the right
00:43:10.800 direction maybe by fits and starts but i
00:43:13.440 think we're going in the right direction
00:43:15.040 and i think that
00:43:16.640 it will be a significant plus to
00:43:18.319 everybody in this room if they live in a
00:43:19.839 more moral society 40 years from now
00:43:21.839 than a less moral but i think the odds
00:43:23.440 are that they will
00:43:24.640 i think the country moves in that
00:43:25.920 direction very difficult to do it all
00:43:28.079 kinds of interests that
00:43:29.599 work against it but
00:43:31.440 uh in the end i think the american
00:43:33.200 people want it
00:43:34.880 and you saw it in civil rights i mean it
00:43:37.119 took television to dramatize what was
00:43:39.440 going on and
00:43:40.880 people that weren't near it preferred
00:43:42.480 not to think about it
00:43:44.000 but it got through to the conscience of
00:43:46.720 the american people
00:43:48.240 and
00:43:49.599 a lot of progress has been made there
00:43:51.280 and there's a lot left to be made but
00:43:52.800 there it's better than it was
00:43:54.960 and the pace may seem very slow to those
00:43:56.880 people involved and i can understand
00:43:58.400 that
00:43:59.119 uh
00:44:00.160 the pace you know for women's suffrage i
00:44:02.640 mean that went
00:44:03.760 for decades and decades and decades a
00:44:05.839 woman could be on a jury
00:44:07.760 i was reading the trial of clarence
00:44:09.440 darrow
00:44:10.560 which took place in california about 19
00:44:12.800 i don't know 10 or 11
00:44:14.480 you know there were no women on the jury
00:44:16.079 the woman wasn't allowed to be on a jury
00:44:18.800 they weren't citizens in that sense so
00:44:21.040 it's the moral
00:44:23.359 behavior of the country has in my view
00:44:26.640 improved but it uh and it'll continue to
00:44:29.280 improve and i hope you all in this room
00:44:30.640 do your part to help it improve
00:44:33.280 i was
00:44:34.480 wondering how uh since the stock
00:44:36.400 market's so high right now if it'd be
00:44:38.560 smart for us to get
00:44:40.079 to get involved now or to wait until
00:44:42.240 until it goes down a little or what
00:44:45.599 yeah i can't tell you whether or not to
00:44:46.960 buy stocks now generally i think it's
00:44:49.359 important that you save money you know
00:44:51.119 and whether whether you put in the stock
00:44:52.560 market
00:44:54.160 i don't think is terribly important i
00:44:56.079 think if you're interested in stocks you
00:44:58.240 should you should buy it you know and
00:44:59.920 you've got a little capital you should
00:45:00.960 buy a few i mean i don't think there's
00:45:02.160 any way of learning about them better
00:45:04.079 than experiencing doing it on paper
00:45:05.839 isn't the same
00:45:07.119 i can guarantee you if you lose money on
00:45:08.800 paper or lose real money it's a
00:45:10.640 different experience and
00:45:13.599 i think you'll learn more about yourself
00:45:15.920 if you do it that way i bought my first
00:45:17.520 stock
00:45:18.400 when i was 11. i was actually i was at
00:45:19.920 rose hill at the time and i bought three
00:45:21.839 shares of city service preferred
00:45:24.240 at
00:45:25.200 38 and it went down to 27 which is
00:45:28.240 something i still remember even though i
00:45:29.520 was 11 at the time
00:45:31.040 uh and then it went up to 40 and i sold
00:45:33.119 it i made five bucks on my three shares
00:45:35.359 after commissions and then it went to
00:45:36.640 200 and something so
00:45:38.480 uh you know i i probably remember that a
00:45:40.800 little better than if i'd been doing it
00:45:42.079 on paper you know
00:45:43.680 and
00:45:44.640 i fooled around doing a lot of things
00:45:46.319 between about age 11 and 19 in the stock
00:45:49.040 market i did charts i did all kinds of
00:45:51.440 technical analysis i read every book i
00:45:53.280 could get on the subject
00:45:55.119 and
00:45:56.079 i didn't do that well i didn't do
00:45:57.520 terrible but i did i was really just
00:45:59.520 floundering around
00:46:01.280 but by
00:46:02.480 that meant by the age of 19 when i read
00:46:04.480 ben graham's book i was at the
00:46:05.760 university of nebraska in lincoln i went
00:46:07.680 and bought this book called the
00:46:08.800 intelligent investor just come out and
00:46:10.880 it had an enormous impact on me
00:46:13.040 now if i hadn't done
00:46:14.880 in the previous eight years if i hadn't
00:46:16.480 been all over the lot i'm not so sure
00:46:18.400 that that book would have had the same
00:46:19.520 impact on me i mean i was by that time i
00:46:21.520 was prepared
00:46:23.119 to read ben graham's book which changed
00:46:24.880 my life financially in an
00:46:26.960 incredible way i mean i wouldn't be up
00:46:29.040 here today if i had read that book but
00:46:31.599 yeah part of life is getting prepared
00:46:34.800 so that
00:46:36.000 when something does happen that's
00:46:37.520 significant you can grasp the
00:46:40.160 significance of it and know what to do
00:46:42.079 with it and
00:46:43.280 i would say that first eight years of
00:46:44.720 fooling around
00:46:46.079 even though it produced nothing
00:46:47.119 financially to speak of
00:46:48.800 uh produced a lot in terms of getting my
00:46:51.359 mind prepared for when i really did read
00:46:53.839 something that made sense so i was ready
00:46:55.680 to accept it and i actually went back
00:46:57.920 and
00:46:58.880 went to columbia to study under the
00:47:00.560 under graham and because of
00:47:03.200 reading that book and all kinds of
00:47:04.480 things flowed out of it so
00:47:06.160 i would encourage you if you're
00:47:07.520 interested in the field to do a few
00:47:09.680 things i'm still trying to make them as
00:47:11.040 intelligent as possible i would try to
00:47:12.800 stick with things businesses i thought i
00:47:14.720 understood i'd still get out that sheet
00:47:16.480 of paper and i'd write i'm doing this
00:47:18.640 because
00:47:19.760 and just test my reasoning then i go
00:47:21.760 back and read it a year later and and
00:47:23.680 see whether what you thought would be
00:47:25.119 true turned out to be true so i would
00:47:27.280 always check myself i believe in grading
00:47:29.760 myself on everything you know doctors
00:47:31.280 have post-mortems and they they do it
00:47:33.680 because they learn from post-mortems uh
00:47:36.160 and business people don't like to do
00:47:37.440 postmortems building plants or buying
00:47:39.119 companies and they never wanted two
00:47:40.880 years later to run a check on how that
00:47:42.880 decision turned out because it it can be
00:47:44.880 unpleasant
00:47:46.079 uh but you learn from postmortems
00:47:49.040 and uh you don't wanna learn it's way
00:47:51.040 better learn from other people's
00:47:52.079 mistakes than your own but you got to
00:47:53.280 learn from a few of your own too and
00:47:55.440 the time to do it is when you're young
00:47:57.920 my question is
00:47:59.200 to what extent do you feel that the
00:48:00.960 government
00:48:02.559 with the the current policies of welfare
00:48:04.880 and social security is it financially
00:48:07.119 competent and fiscally prepared for the
00:48:09.680 future
00:48:11.920 well i
00:48:13.280 i think that
00:48:15.599 the country as a whole is quite
00:48:17.839 quite well prepared for the future that
00:48:19.520 doesn't mean i'd adopt would adopt every
00:48:21.839 policy they have but
00:48:23.440 i think a we have an enormously rich
00:48:26.000 society enormously rich society and
00:48:28.160 it'll get richer
00:48:29.920 uh everyone isn't going to participate
00:48:31.839 in that some will won't participate
00:48:33.599 because of physical disabilities others
00:48:35.920 because of mental disabilities other
00:48:37.359 because of shortcomings in the education
00:48:38.960 they receive when they were growing up
00:48:40.160 all kinds of reasons
00:48:42.079 we have a prosperous enough society
00:48:45.040 to be able to take care of
00:48:46.880 of those people and we should take care
00:48:48.880 of them and how we do it so that they
00:48:51.040 feel most useful in life and how we do
00:48:52.960 it so that we continue to encourage
00:48:54.960 people to be more productive themselves
00:48:56.480 and all that i mean those are not easy
00:48:58.480 questions but
00:48:59.760 but that shouldn't take our eye off the
00:49:01.599 ball of feeling we should do something
00:49:03.280 about it that
00:49:04.800 um i often i i pose this problem
00:49:07.359 sometimes to people i say let's assume
00:49:09.040 that it's 24 hours before you're born
00:49:12.160 and all of you can take this test 24
00:49:13.920 hours before you're born
00:49:15.680 and a genie comes to you
00:49:18.319 and the genie says
00:49:20.720 what was your name again out there
00:49:22.960 uh whatever
00:49:24.319 we'll call you joe uh
00:49:26.480 and the genie says joe
00:49:28.319 says you look pretty promising to me
00:49:30.559 i think you've got kind of a sense of
00:49:32.160 fair play and
00:49:33.760 and a good mind and so i'm going to let
00:49:36.079 you have an extraordinary opportunity
00:49:39.359 i'm going to let you design the world
00:49:41.920 into which you're going to be born in 24
00:49:43.680 hours
00:49:44.880 it's yours
00:49:46.240 you pick out the political rules you
00:49:48.400 pick out the economic rules you pick out
00:49:50.800 the social rules you design the world
00:49:54.079 and when you're born in 24 hours you're
00:49:55.760 going to be born into that world
00:49:58.720 and that's the world that's going to
00:49:59.760 exist for your lifetime
00:50:01.760 for your children's lifetime for your
00:50:03.280 grandchildren's lifetime
00:50:05.599 and you having heard of some of these
00:50:06.800 genie jokes in the past would say
00:50:09.119 what's the catch
00:50:10.960 genie says well it's a very slight catch
00:50:14.319 i said when when you're born in 24 hours
00:50:16.960 you're going to emerge in this world you
00:50:18.559 designed
00:50:19.680 but what you don't know
00:50:21.760 is whether you're going to be born
00:50:24.000 black or white male or female
00:50:27.680 rich or poor
00:50:29.359 brighter
00:50:31.359 able-bodied or infirm
00:50:33.359 in the united states or afghanistan
00:50:36.160 all you know
00:50:38.079 is that you're going to reach into this
00:50:40.240 barrel which now has six billion balls
00:50:42.079 as we know representing one person
00:50:44.319 every person in the world and you're
00:50:46.000 going to participate in what i call the
00:50:47.520 ovarian lottery
00:50:49.200 you're going to take one ball out of
00:50:50.640 that barrel and you're never going to
00:50:51.520 get another ball that's you
00:50:53.520 you're one ball and now you're going to
00:50:54.800 emerge
00:50:55.839 now what kind of rules
00:50:57.760 do you want to have for that society
00:51:00.319 not knowing which ball you're going to
00:51:01.920 get
00:51:03.200 now that i put to you is the way
00:51:05.839 i think people should think about social
00:51:07.920 policy and if you're born if you're
00:51:09.680 lucky enough to be born in this country
00:51:10.960 you've won the lottery already
00:51:13.040 but we should have a system in my view
00:51:16.240 that encourages the jack welch's and the
00:51:18.240 bill gates's and all of that to work
00:51:20.319 far beyond the time when it has any
00:51:22.079 economic significance to them we want
00:51:24.160 people commanding those resources who
00:51:26.480 are extremely able to commanding them
00:51:28.319 that's how that's how the standard of
00:51:30.319 living moves forward so we should want
00:51:32.880 you know we should want tom osborne
00:51:34.960 coaching in nebraska we should want we
00:51:37.040 should want bill gates designing
00:51:38.400 software and we don't want to mix up
00:51:39.839 those two we don't want to we don't we
00:51:41.839 don't want to get bill coaching in
00:51:42.880 nebraska uh so
00:51:45.040 you want you want people who want a
00:51:46.720 system that directs gets people to their
00:51:49.280 potential and and puts them
00:51:51.680 in the position where they can do the
00:51:53.119 most good for society but you also want
00:51:55.520 a system for the people get the wrong
00:51:56.800 ball i mean somebody's going to get the
00:51:58.559 ball
00:51:59.599 you know that says 80 iq somebody's
00:52:01.359 going to get the ball
00:52:02.720 that says this disease or that disease
00:52:04.800 early in life that cripples them and
00:52:06.880 we've got a rich enough society
00:52:09.440 that we can we can take care of those
00:52:11.280 people and i think that to get back to
00:52:14.079 your question i think that this society
00:52:15.920 will move more and more in that
00:52:17.359 direction it has the capability of
00:52:19.040 moving more and more in that direction
00:52:20.559 as our resources
00:52:22.319 and our output increases and i think
00:52:24.480 that
00:52:25.520 it has the will to do that in a general
00:52:27.440 way although like i say there have
00:52:28.640 always been lots of fits and starts so
00:52:30.480 there is no shortage
00:52:32.720 in the united states of resources
00:52:35.280 there's no shortage of output
00:52:38.000 you have to have a system that
00:52:39.920 encourages people
00:52:41.680 to behave to the limit of their
00:52:43.760 abilities and puts them in the right
00:52:45.280 place but then you have to make sure
00:52:47.119 that everybody gets taken care of too
00:52:49.359 and i wanted to know how you think the
00:52:50.720 media affects the world economically
00:52:52.960 today well it's a small question
00:52:56.000 uh
00:52:58.160 well what it obviously does simply
00:53:00.559 because it's it's moved so far
00:53:02.400 technologically
00:53:03.920 is it's brought it together in a big way
00:53:05.680 i mean i was over in china a few years
00:53:07.200 ago and i was right after the time of
00:53:08.720 the women's conference in
00:53:10.480 in uh in beijing
00:53:12.559 and i was reading
00:53:14.559 the chinese
00:53:15.920 coverage
00:53:17.200 uh
00:53:18.160 of that conference and and of course it
00:53:20.400 it had nothing to do with what was
00:53:21.680 taking place but the internet was coming
00:53:23.440 in and and
00:53:24.880 you know you can
00:53:26.559 you can access the washington post or
00:53:29.119 the new york times or i get the
00:53:30.640 washington post at 9 30 here at night in
00:53:33.200 effect i never could get it the next day
00:53:35.839 on on through through uh physical
00:53:38.000 delivery but i buy electronic delivery i
00:53:39.920 can read it
00:53:41.040 uh you know
00:53:42.400 probably earlier than most the people in
00:53:43.680 washington are reading it so
00:53:45.520 the
00:53:46.400 ability to communicate
00:53:48.559 and the degree to which the world can
00:53:50.160 have awareness of what's going on every
00:53:51.760 place in the world it's just
00:53:53.760 you know it's been a quantum leap and
00:53:57.520 you know that will have there are a lot
00:53:59.440 of things that come out of that and uh
00:54:01.680 uh
00:54:02.559 net they're a plus over time but the
00:54:04.720 they i mean they the
00:54:06.240 the ability of information to be
00:54:08.240 available to everyone worldwide almost
00:54:11.200 instant instantaneously it's it's it's a
00:54:14.079 can be huge advances in things like
00:54:15.920 medicine for example just to pick one uh
00:54:19.359 so
00:54:20.800 it's a net plus it has a
00:54:23.520 it has a big effect and
00:54:26.400 the definition of media has now been
00:54:28.319 expanded
00:54:29.760 enormously i mean there were three
00:54:31.280 television networks in
00:54:33.040 in the 19 and you know in the early
00:54:35.040 1960s and that was it there were three
00:54:36.960 highways information traveled
00:54:38.559 electronically
00:54:40.079 and
00:54:40.880 if the three pieces of information where
00:54:42.559 i love lucy you know something else and
00:54:44.319 something else those were the three
00:54:45.839 choices of information or entertainment
00:54:47.520 that you had
00:54:48.799 for tens and tens of millions of people
00:54:50.720 sitting there looking at a tube
00:54:52.640 now it's unlimited and that's only what
00:54:54.400 three or so decades so it's just
00:54:56.480 exploded and it'll continue to explode
00:54:58.400 and net i think it's a plus
00:55:00.880 and i think it's one o'clock i want to
00:55:02.960 thank you all i i wish you well you're
00:55:05.119 going to do terrific thanks
