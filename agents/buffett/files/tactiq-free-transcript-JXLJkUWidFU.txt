00:00:00.160 you would be better off if when you got
00:00:01.800 out of school here you got a punch card
00:00:05.040 with 20 punches on it and every big
00:00:07.720 Financial every financial decision you
00:00:09.440 made you used up a punch you'd get very
00:00:11.960 rich because you'd think through very
00:00:13.920 hard each one if you went to a cocktail
00:00:16.039 party and somebody talked about a
00:00:17.199 company he didn't even understand what
00:00:18.439 they did or couldn't pronounce the name
00:00:20.439 but they made some money last week and
00:00:22.199 another one like it you wouldn't buy it
00:00:24.080 if you only had 20 punches on that card
00:00:25.880 there's a temptation to dabble if uh
00:00:29.119 particularly during B markets uh uh in
00:00:31.840 stocks it's so easy you know it's easier
00:00:33.920 now than ever because you can do it
00:00:35.079 online you know just you click it in and
00:00:37.239 maybe it goes up the point and get
00:00:38.760 excited about that and you buy another
00:00:39.960 one the next day and so on you can't
00:00:41.719 make any money over time doing that but
00:00:43.960 if you had a punch card with only 20
00:00:45.520 punches you weren't going to get another
00:00:47.320 one in the rest of your life you would
00:00:48.719 think a long time before every
00:00:50.520 investment decision and you would make
00:00:53.120 good ones and you'd make big ones and
00:00:55.559 you probably wouldn't even use all 20
00:00:56.879 punches at the in your lifetime but you
00:00:59.199 wouldn't need to
00:01:01.239 testing 1 million 2 million
00:01:03.810 [Music]
00:01:06.640 Okay I uh I came in from Nebraska today
00:01:10.880 and uh you're probably all familiar with
00:01:12.759 us mainly by our football team we had
00:01:15.560 those fellas with the uh
00:01:18.320 the big white helmets with those red
00:01:21.600 ends on them I asked one of our starters
00:01:24.799 the other day what's the nend stand for
00:01:26.320 and he said knowledge
00:01:30.280 we we uh we make it tough on them though
00:01:32.720 I mean they you don't coaster Nebraska
00:01:34.880 just because you're a football player
00:01:36.479 they they major an agricultural
00:01:37.920 economics and there's a two question
00:01:40.759 final uh for all of the players and
00:01:44.439 first question is uh what did Old
00:01:46.840 McDonald have and uh they were giving
00:01:50.399 that to one of our potential
00:01:52.079 Heisman uh Trophy winners the other day
00:01:55.040 and he started to
00:01:57.600 sweat finally he brightened up he said
00:02:00.280 Farm Professor delighted of course you
00:02:03.240 don't want to flun a Heisman candidate
00:02:05.360 uh so he said now he said you're halfway
00:02:06.799 home he said just one more question how
00:02:09.038 do you spell
00:02:10.318 Farm now the guy really starts to
00:02:13.120 sweat he looks at the ceiling and he
00:02:15.280 looks
00:02:16.200 around find his face bright he says e e
00:02:21.160 IO so watch for that guy this year he'll
00:02:23.640 be Dynamite uh I really want to talk
00:02:25.280 about what's on your mind so we're going
00:02:26.560 to do a qaa in a minute I uh there are a
00:02:29.360 couple questions I always get asked you
00:02:31.440 know I always uh people always say well
00:02:33.519 who should I go to work for when I get
00:02:34.800 out and I've got a very simple answer we
00:02:37.720 we may elaborate more on this as we go
00:02:39.280 along but uh you know the the real thing
00:02:41.920 to do is to get going and for some
00:02:45.239 institution or individual that you
00:02:47.959 admire I mean it's crazy to take in
00:02:50.720 between jobs just because they look good
00:02:53.200 on your resume or because you get a
00:02:54.640 little higher starting pay I I was up at
00:02:56.800 Harvard while back and very nice young
00:02:59.360 guy picked me up at the airport uh
00:03:01.280 Harbor business school attendee and he
00:03:03.120 said look he said I went to undergrad
00:03:05.519 here and then I worked for X and Y and Z
00:03:08.799 and now I've come here and he said I I
00:03:12.239 thought it would really round up my
00:03:14.159 resume perfectly if I went to work now
00:03:16.760 for a big management consulting firm and
00:03:19.040 I said well is that what you want to do
00:03:21.239 and he said no but he said that's the
00:03:23.239 perfect resume and I said well when are
00:03:25.599 you going to start doing what you like
00:03:26.959 and he said well I'll get to that
00:03:28.080 someday and I I said well you I said
00:03:30.120 your plan sounds to me a lot like saving
00:03:31.959 up sex for your old age you
00:03:34.480 know it just doesn't make a lot of
00:03:37.280 sense and I told that same group I said
00:03:40.120 you know go to work for whomever you
00:03:41.319 admire the most and I said you can't get
00:03:43.080 a bad result you'll jump out of bed in
00:03:44.439 the morning and you'll be having fun and
00:03:45.920 Dean called me up a couple weeks later
00:03:48.560 said what' you tell those kids he said
00:03:50.640 they're all becoming
00:03:52.799 self-employed so you've got to you've
00:03:54.599 got to temper that advice a little bit
00:03:56.480 uh uh Play One game a little bit with me
00:03:59.360 for just a minute and then we'll uh then
00:04:01.079 we'll get to your questions um uh I'd
00:04:03.920 like for the
00:04:05.760 moment to have
00:04:08.159 you uh well have you pretend I've made
00:04:11.280 you a great offer and I've told you that
00:04:15.319 you could pick any one of your
00:04:16.798 classmates and you now know each other
00:04:18.798 probably pretty well after being here
00:04:20.000 for a while you can pick you'd have 24
00:04:22.320 hours to think it over and you can pick
00:04:23.639 any one of your
00:04:24.800 classmates and you get 10% of their
00:04:28.000 earnings for the rest of their life
00:04:30.320 Liv and I ask you what goes through your
00:04:34.639 mind in
00:04:36.199 determining which one of those you would
00:04:39.199 pick you can't pick the one with the
00:04:40.720 richest father that doesn't count I mean
00:04:42.360 you got to got to do this on Merit but
00:04:45.000 you probably wouldn't pick the person
00:04:47.560 that gets the highest grades in the
00:04:49.120 class I mean that nothing wrong with
00:04:50.840 getting the highest grades in the class
00:04:52.240 but that that's not that isn't going to
00:04:55.120 be the quality that that that sets
00:04:58.360 apart uh a big winner uh from the rest
00:05:01.880 of the pack think about who you would
00:05:04.199 pick and why and I think you'll find
00:05:06.919 when you get
00:05:07.880 through you'll pick some individual
00:05:10.759 you've all got the ability you wouldn't
00:05:12.120 be here otherwise and you've all got the
00:05:13.600 energy I mean you've got you know the
00:05:16.759 initiative is here the intelligence is
00:05:19.520 here uh throughout the class but some of
00:05:22.639 you are going to be bigger winners than
00:05:23.720 others and uh it gets down to a bunch of
00:05:27.800 qualities that
00:05:30.280 uh interestingly enough are are are
00:05:32.840 self-made I mean it's not how tall you
00:05:34.960 are it's not whether you can kick a
00:05:35.880 football 60 yards it's not whether you
00:05:37.400 can run the 100 yard dash in 10 seconds
00:05:39.440 it's not whether you're the best looking
00:05:41.160 person in the room it's a whole bunch of
00:05:44.000 qualities that really come out of Ben
00:05:46.319 Franklin or the Boy Scout Cod or or
00:05:48.319 whatever it may be I mean it's it's it's
00:05:50.680 Integrity it's honesty it's it's
00:05:53.000 generosity it's it's being willing to do
00:05:55.600 more than your share it's it's uh just
00:05:58.160 all those qualities that are self-
00:06:00.880 selected and then if you look on the
00:06:02.759 other side of the Ledger because there's
00:06:03.919 always a catch to these you know free
00:06:06.199 gifts and Genie jokes so you also have
00:06:09.240 to and this is the fun part you also
00:06:11.599 have to sell short one of the your
00:06:13.280 classmates and pay 10% of what they do
00:06:16.160 so who do you think is going to do the
00:06:17.720 worst in the class this is way more fun
00:06:19.759 and and think about it again and again
00:06:21.880 it isn't the it isn't the person with
00:06:23.360 the lowest grades or anything anything
00:06:25.199 of the sort it's the person who just
00:06:27.479 doesn't shape up in the Department I
00:06:30.560 mean we look for three things when we
00:06:32.599 hire people we look for intelligence we
00:06:34.599 look for for initiative or energy and we
00:06:38.120 look for integrity and if they don't
00:06:40.319 have the ladder the first two will kill
00:06:42.039 you because if you're going to get
00:06:43.039 somebody without Integrity you want them
00:06:44.919 lazy and dumb I mean you don't want to
00:06:48.280 you don't want to smart and energetic so
00:06:50.639 uh it's that third quality but
00:06:52.720 everything about that quality is your
00:06:54.199 choice you know you you can't change the
00:06:56.160 way you were wired much but you can
00:06:58.080 change a lot of what you do with that
00:07:00.280 wiring and it's the habits that you
00:07:02.879 generate now on those qualities or those
00:07:05.400 negative qualities I mean the person the
00:07:07.759 person who always you know claims credit
00:07:10.800 for things they didn't do that always
00:07:12.319 cuts Corners that you can't count on I
00:07:15.240 mean in the end those those are habit
00:07:17.319 patterns and the time to form the right
00:07:19.360 habits is when you're when you're your
00:07:21.360 age I mean it uh uh it doesn't do me
00:07:24.720 much good to get golf lessons now if I'd
00:07:26.520 gotten golf lessons when I was your age
00:07:28.039 I might be a decent golfer but but it
00:07:31.599 someone once said the chains of habit
00:07:33.560 are too are too light to be felt until
00:07:36.080 they're too heavy to be broken and I see
00:07:37.759 that all the time I see people with
00:07:39.520 habit patterns that are
00:07:41.280 self-destructive uh when they're 50 or
00:07:43.160 60 and they they really can't change
00:07:44.800 them they're imprisoned by that but
00:07:46.680 you're not imprisoned by anything so
00:07:49.240 when you write down the qualities of
00:07:50.800 that person that you'd like to buy 10%
00:07:53.599 of look at that list and ask yourself is
00:07:57.280 there anything on that list I couldn't
00:07:58.479 do the
00:08:00.319 there aren't there won't be and when you
00:08:02.280 look at the person you sell short and
00:08:04.319 you look at those qualities that you
00:08:05.639 don't like if you see any of those in
00:08:08.280 yourself egotism whatever it may be
00:08:11.520 selfishness you can get rid of that I
00:08:13.599 mean that is not ordained and uh if you
00:08:17.800 follow that and and Ben Franklin did
00:08:19.879 this and my old boss Ben Graham did this
00:08:21.479 at early ages in their young teens they
00:08:23.280 just Ben Graham looked around and he
00:08:25.039 said who do I admire you know and he
00:08:28.120 wanted to be admired himself and he said
00:08:29.759 you know why do I admire these other
00:08:31.159 people and he said if I admire them for
00:08:33.399 these reasons maybe other people will
00:08:34.599 admire me if I behave in a similar
00:08:36.240 Manner and he and he decided what kind
00:08:37.919 of a person he wanted to be and if you
00:08:40.880 follow that at the end you'll be the
00:08:43.279 person you want to buy 10% of I mean
00:08:44.959 that's the goal in the end and it's it's
00:08:47.560 something that's achievable by by
00:08:49.240 everybody in this room so that's the end
00:08:51.080 of the sermon now let's let's talk about
00:08:52.680 what's on your mind and hey guys if
00:08:55.760 you're enjoying this warm Buffett video

00:09:31.920 supporting the channel it means the
00:09:33.760 world to me and this is my small way of
00:09:35.880 repaying you now let's get back to the
00:09:38.360 video you can ask anything the only
00:09:40.959 thing I won't tell you is what we're
00:09:43.040 buying or selling or about you know I I
00:09:46.120 don't even tell myself that I mean I I
00:09:47.720 write it down and then it's like the
00:09:49.200 Coca-Cola formula you know there's only
00:09:51.120 two people can get into the trust
00:09:53.079 department and find out what they are
00:09:54.320 and I don't know who the two are so it's
00:09:57.120 uh we don't talk about what we're buying
00:09:59.399 you're selling but anything else is fair
00:10:00.880 game personal business anything i''d
00:10:03.160 like to talk about and actually the
00:10:05.079 tougher the questions are the more
00:10:06.959 interesting it is for me so don't don't
00:10:09.000 spare my feelings I mean just throw at
00:10:10.959 my head and uh and with that let's uh I
00:10:14.200 guess we've got a microphone is this the
00:10:15.560 only microphone or is there one on this
00:10:17.600 the only microphone right here ask a
00:10:19.279 question you'll need to come down to
00:10:20.279 this microphone just stand in line and
00:10:23.440 and I'll be read just fil and then you
00:10:26.240 can yes I have an oldfashioned belief
00:10:29.079 that I
00:10:30.560 can only should expect to make money in
00:10:33.720 things that I understand and when I say
00:10:35.639 understand I don't mean understand you
00:10:38.440 know what the product does or anything
00:10:40.279 like that I mean understand what the
00:10:42.680 economics of the business are likely to
00:10:44.880 look at look like 10 years from now or
00:10:47.000 20 years from now I know in general what
00:10:51.160 the economics will say wrigly chewing
00:10:52.839 gum will look like 10 years from now the
00:10:55.560 Internet isn't going to change the way
00:10:57.120 people chew gum it isn't going to change
00:10:59.639 which gum they chew you know if you own
00:11:02.680 the chewing gum Market in a big way and
00:11:05.760 you've got double Min and spearmint and
00:11:07.519 Juicy Fruit those Brands will be there
00:11:10.639 10 years from now so I can't pinpoint
00:11:13.200 exactly what the numbers are going to
00:11:14.920 look like on regly but I'm not going to
00:11:16.160 be way off if I try to look forward on
00:11:18.160 something like that that evaluating that
00:11:20.800 company is within what I call my circle
00:11:22.639 of competence I understand what they do
00:11:25.560 I understand the economics of it I
00:11:27.360 understand the competitive aspects of
00:11:29.320 the
00:11:29.980 [Music]
00:11:31.120 business there can be all kinds of
00:11:33.360 companies that have wonderful Futures
00:11:35.880 but I don't know which ones they are uh
00:11:38.920 I given talks in the past where I carry
00:11:41.519 with me a a 70 page tightly printed list
00:11:46.839 and it shows 2,000 auto companies now if
00:11:50.120 at the start of the 20th century you had
00:11:53.720 seen what the auto was going to do to
00:11:55.480 this country the impact it would have on
00:11:57.399 the lives of you then you're children
00:11:59.639 and grandchildren and so on that what it
00:12:02.000 just it transformed the American
00:12:04.600 landscape but of those 2,000 companies
00:12:08.160 you know three basically survive and
00:12:10.880 they haven't done that well uh at many
00:12:13.360 times so how do you pick three winners
00:12:16.639 out of 2000 I mean it's not so easy to
00:12:19.079 do it's easy when you look back but it's
00:12:21.079 not so easy looking forward so you could
00:12:22.399 have been dead right on on the fact that
00:12:25.959 the Auto industry in fact you probably
00:12:28.320 couldn't have predicted how big impact
00:12:29.920 it would have but you wouldn't have if
00:12:32.519 if You' bought companies across the
00:12:33.959 board you wouldn't have made any money
00:12:35.279 because the economic characteristics of
00:12:37.639 that business were not easy to I said I
00:12:39.800 I've always said the easier thing to do
00:12:41.120 is figure out who
00:12:42.320 loses and what you really should have
00:12:44.320 done in 19 05 or so when you saw what
00:12:47.279 was going to happen with the auto is you
00:12:49.519 should have gone short horses there were
00:12:51.680 20 million horses in 1900 and there's
00:12:53.480 about 4 million horses now so it's easy
00:12:55.440 to figure out the losers you know the
00:12:56.959 loser is the horse but the winner
00:12:59.920 was the auto overall but 2,000 companies
00:13:03.720 just about failed a few merged out and
00:13:05.600 so on uh there were three companies auto
00:13:08.839 companies in the dowo Industrials in the
00:13:13.000 1920s and 30s stud Baker Nash Kelvinator
00:13:17.399 and Hudson Motor now those names are all
00:13:19.680 familiar to me and maybe some of them
00:13:21.399 are familiar to you but they're not
00:13:23.160 making any cars you know they didn't
00:13:25.279 make money and yet at one time they were
00:13:27.560 in the Dow 30 they were were the
00:13:29.959 aristocrats of American Business and
00:13:32.800 they got creamed so figuring out the
00:13:35.680 economic characteristics of a the
00:13:38.240 winners in a wonderful business is not
00:13:40.480 easy in North Carolina you know Orville
00:13:43.120 and Wilbur took off or I guess Orville
00:13:44.920 took off and Wilbur watched I'd have
00:13:46.440 been Wilbur uh
00:13:49.320 but if you could have seen the future of
00:13:52.040 the airline business from that point
00:13:53.920 forward and how that would transform
00:13:55.560 things you know it would it would have
00:13:57.519 blown you away and it's excited people
00:13:59.079 Co incidentally ever since but if there
00:14:01.199 had been a capitalist at Kitty Hawk he
00:14:03.519 should have shot Orval down I mean it
00:14:06.160 because it's done nothing but cost
00:14:07.959 investors money there were over
00:14:09.800 400 airplane companies in the 1920s and
00:14:12.959 30s alone there was an Omaha there was
00:14:14.759 in Nebraska we were the Silicon Valley
00:14:16.720 of apparently of aircraft and they all
00:14:19.880 disappeared been a terrible business at
00:14:23.199 the end of 1991 if You' added up the
00:14:25.360 aggregate earnings from all airline
00:14:27.480 companies with billion poured in since
00:14:30.360 Wilbur and oral were down there they
00:14:32.680 came to less than
00:14:34.120 zero the number of passengers went up
00:14:36.639 every year the importance of the
00:14:39.079 industry was dramatically increased
00:14:41.680 decade by decade and nobody made any
00:14:44.560 money it uh so figuring out the economic
00:14:48.720 consequences TV I think there's I don't
00:14:51.320 know 20 25 million sets a year sold in
00:14:53.320 the United States I don't think there's
00:14:54.920 one of them made in the United States
00:14:56.199 anymore I mean you'd say TV set
00:14:58.199 manufacturer what a wonderful business I
00:14:59.839 mean everybody now nobody had a TV in
00:15:02.880 1950 there abouts 45 to 50 everybody has
00:15:07.160 multiple sets now but nobody is in the
00:15:09.839 United States has made any real money
00:15:11.759 making the sets they're all out of
00:15:13.040 business you know the Magna boxes the
00:15:15.000 rcas all of those companies radio was
00:15:17.639 the equivalent of the 20 over 500
00:15:19.360 companies making radios in the 1920s
00:15:21.639 again I don't think there's a a US radio
00:15:23.839 manufacturer at the present time but
00:15:26.279 Coca-Cola you know what was it 188 for
00:15:29.560 Jacob's Pharmacy or whatever fellow
00:15:31.639 comes up with something a lot of Co
00:15:33.240 copers over the years but now you've got
00:15:36.120 a company that is selling roughly 1.1
00:15:40.560 billion 8 ounce servings of its product
00:15:42.920 not all C bright and some others daily
00:15:46.040 throughout the world
00:15:47.600 117 years later so understanding the
00:15:51.279 economic characteristics of a business
00:15:53.680 is different than predicting the fact
00:15:55.600 that an industry is going to do
00:15:56.959 wonderfully so when I look at the
00:16:00.480 internet businesses or I look at Tech
00:16:02.639 businesses I say this is a marvelous
00:16:04.680 thing and I love to play around on the
00:16:06.000 computer and it now I order my books
00:16:08.079 from Amazon and all kinds of things but
00:16:10.199 I don't know who's going to win and
00:16:12.000 unless I know who's going to win I'm not
00:16:14.160 interested in investing I'll just play
00:16:15.480 around on the computer and uh uh
00:16:18.800 defining your circle of competence is
00:16:21.440 the most important aspect of investing
00:16:24.319 it's not how important how how large
00:16:26.720 your circle is you don't have to be an
00:16:28.959 expert on everything but knowing where
00:16:31.440 the perimeter of that Circle of what you
00:16:33.240 know and what you don't know is and
00:16:34.959 staying inside of it is all important
00:16:38.440 Tom Watson senior who started IBM said
00:16:41.839 in his book he said I'm no genius said
00:16:45.319 but I'm smart in spots and I stay around
00:16:47.399 those spots and you know that is the key
00:16:50.319 uh so if I understand a few things and I
00:16:53.240 stick in that Arena I'll do okay and if
00:16:57.000 I don't understand something but I get
00:16:58.199 all excited about because my neighbors
00:16:59.560 are talking about the stocks are going
00:17:00.759 up and everything they start fooling
00:17:02.800 around someplace else eventually I'll
00:17:04.280 get creamed and I
00:17:05.640 should so now let's go over here hello
00:17:08.799 Mr Buffett I got two short questions one
00:17:11.839 is how do you find intrinsic value in a
00:17:14.760 company well intrinsic
00:17:17.039 value is what is the number that if you
00:17:20.720 were all knowing about the future and
00:17:23.520 could predict all the cash that a b a
00:17:25.720 business would give you between now and
00:17:27.160 Judgment Day
00:17:29.200 discounted at the proper discount rate
00:17:32.720 that number is what the intrinsic value
00:17:34.520 of a business is in other
00:17:36.200 words the only reason for making
00:17:38.240 investment and laying out money now is
00:17:39.600 to get more money later on right that's
00:17:41.520 that's what investing is all about now
00:17:43.799 when you look at a stock when you look
00:17:45.000 at a bond so means United States
00:17:46.880 Government Bond it's very easy to tell
00:17:47.840 them what you're going to get back it
00:17:49.240 says it right on the bond it says when
00:17:50.919 you get the interest payments it says
00:17:52.480 when you get the principle so it's very
00:17:55.200 easy to figure out the value of a bond
00:17:56.720 it can change tomorrow if interest rates
00:17:58.200 change but you are the cash flows are
00:18:01.080 printed on the bond the cash flows
00:18:04.080 aren't printed on a stock certificate
00:18:06.120 that's the job of the analyst is to
00:18:08.679 print out change that stock certificate
00:18:11.520 which represents an interest in the
00:18:12.760 business and change that into a bond and
00:18:15.280 say this is what I think it's going to
00:18:17.120 pay out in the future when we buy you
00:18:20.440 know some new machine for Shaw to make
00:18:23.400 carpet that's what we're thinking about
00:18:25.000 obviously and you you all learn that in
00:18:26.600 business school but it's the same thing
00:18:28.320 for a big business it it if you buy
00:18:30.640 Coca-Cola today the company is selling
00:18:33.159 for about10 to 15 billion do in the
00:18:36.240 market the question is if you had 110 or
00:18:38.919 15 billion you wouldn't be listening to
00:18:41.080 me but uh I'd be listening to you
00:18:43.120 incidentally uh but the question is
00:18:45.600 would you lay it out today to get what
00:18:49.159 the Coca-Cola company is going to
00:18:50.640 deliver to you over the next two or 3
00:18:53.280 hundred years discount rate doesn't make
00:18:54.760 much difference after as you get further
00:18:56.760 out but and that is a question how much
00:18:58.919 cash they're going to give you it isn't
00:19:00.440 a question of you know isn't a question
00:19:02.760 of how many analysts are going to
00:19:04.000 recommend it or what the volume in the
00:19:05.640 stock is or what the chart looks like or
00:19:07.640 anything it's a question of how much
00:19:08.960 cash it's going to give you that's the
00:19:10.039 only reason the true if you're buying a
00:19:11.919 farm it's true if you're buying an
00:19:13.320 apartment house any financial asset oil
00:19:16.919 in the ground you're laying out cash now
00:19:18.960 to get more cash back later on and the
00:19:21.120 question is is how much you going to get
00:19:23.720 when are you going to get it and how
00:19:25.200 sure are you and when I calcul calculate
00:19:29.080 intrinsic value of a business when we
00:19:31.440 buy businesses and whether we're buying
00:19:33.520 all of a business or a little piece of a
00:19:35.240 business I always think we're buying the
00:19:36.559 whole business because that's my
00:19:38.080 approach to it I look at it and say what
00:19:41.000 what will come out of this business and
00:19:42.600 when and what you really like of course
00:19:45.720 is them to be able to use the money they
00:19:47.480 earn and earn higher Returns on it as
00:19:49.840 you go along I mean Berkshire has never
00:19:51.880 distributed anything to its shareholders
00:19:53.919 but its ability to distribute goes up as
00:19:56.320 the value of the businesses we own
00:19:57.960 increases we can compound it internally
00:20:01.080 but the real question is Berkshire
00:20:03.840 selling for we'll say 105 or so billion
00:20:06.760 now
00:20:08.320 uh what can we distribute from that 100
00:20:12.120 if you're going to buy the whole company
00:20:13.440 for 105 billion now can we distribute
00:20:16.240 enough cash to you soon enough to make
00:20:20.159 it sensible at present interest rates to
00:20:22.880 lay out that cash now and that's that's
00:20:24.679 what it gets down to and if the if you
00:20:26.080 can't answer that question you can't buy
00:20:27.960 the stock
00:20:29.240 you know you can you can gamble in the
00:20:30.760 stock if you want to or your neighbors
00:20:32.559 can buy it but if you don't answer that
00:20:34.120 question and I I can't answer that for
00:20:36.720 for internet companies for example there
00:20:38.480 a lot of companies that all kinds of
00:20:39.600 companies I can't answer it for but I
00:20:40.799 just stay away from those number two so
00:20:43.760 you got formulas involved in finding
00:20:45.520 intrinsic values on certain companies I
00:20:47.640 you've got a mathematical system set up
00:20:49.559 just kind of present value of future
00:20:50.880 cash yeah second short question is why
00:20:53.679 haven't you um written down your set of
00:20:57.679 formulas or your strategies in written
00:21:00.960 form so you can share with everyone else
00:21:02.840 well I think I actually have written
00:21:04.039 about that if you read the annual
00:21:05.840 reports over the recent years in fact
00:21:07.559 the most recent annual report I I I use
00:21:10.760 what I've just been talking about I use
00:21:11.960 the illustration of ESOP because here
00:21:13.559 ESOP was in 600 BC smart man wasn't
00:21:17.480 smart enough to know was 600 BC though I
00:21:19.600 mean would take a little foresight uh
00:21:23.200 but ESOP you know in between tortoises
00:21:26.400 and hairs and all these other things he
00:21:27.880 found time to about you know birds and
00:21:30.520 he said a bird in the hand is worth to
00:21:32.360 in the bush now that isn't quite
00:21:35.400 Complete because the question is how
00:21:38.120 sure are you that there are two in the
00:21:39.480 bush and how long do you have to wait to
00:21:41.600 get them out now he probably knew that
00:21:45.200 but he just didn't have time because he
00:21:46.640 had all these other Proverbs to write uh
00:21:49.039 and had to get on with it so but he was
00:21:51.559 halfway there in 600 BC that's all there
00:21:54.600 is to investing is how many birds are in
00:21:57.279 the bush when are you going to get them
00:21:59.360 out and how sure are you now if interest
00:22:02.120 rates are
00:22:04.960 15% roughly you've got to get two birds
00:22:07.799 out of the bush in five years to equal
00:22:09.640 the bird in the hand but if interest
00:22:11.760 rates are 3% and you can get two birds
00:22:14.400 out in 20 years it still makes sense to
00:22:17.360 give up the bird in the hand because
00:22:19.159 it's all gets back to discounting
00:22:20.919 against an interest an interest rate
00:22:23.960 problem is often you don't know you know
00:22:26.360 not only how many birds are in the bush
00:22:28.279 but in the case of the internet
00:22:29.240 companies there weren't any birds in the
00:22:30.440 bush
00:22:31.760 but but they still take the bird that
00:22:33.840 you give them in the hand but it's but I
00:22:36.799 I I actually have written about this
00:22:38.240 sort of thing and uh stealing heavily
00:22:40.559 from ESOP who wrote it some 2600 years
00:22:43.760 ago but I've been behind on my reading
00:22:46.520 yeah good morning um I know you're famed
00:22:49.159 for your success but I was curious if
00:22:51.320 there were any particular moments in
00:22:52.760 your life that or mistakes or failures
00:22:55.360 that you've made that were particularly
00:22:56.720 memorable what you may have learned from
00:22:58.640 them and if you had any particular
00:22:59.960 advice for the students here and dealing
00:23:02.240 with uh with uh discouraging
00:23:05.440 circumstances I well I made I've made a
00:23:07.200 lot of mistakes biggest mistake well not
00:23:09.520 the biggest necessarily the biggest but
00:23:11.360 but buying Burkshire haway itself was a
00:23:13.120 mistake because Berkshire was a lousy
00:23:15.320 textile business and I bought it very
00:23:17.640 cheap I'd been taught by Ben Graham to
00:23:21.720 buy things on a quantitative basis look
00:23:23.720 around for things that are cheap and
00:23:26.760 that I was taught that we'll say in 194
00:23:28.480 9 or 50 made a big impression on me so I
00:23:30.360 went around looking for what I call you
00:23:34.159 cigar butts of stocks and the cigar butt
00:23:37.360 approach to buying stocks is that you
00:23:38.919 walk down the street and you're looking
00:23:40.840 around for cigar butts and you find this
00:23:42.840 on thisly this terrible looking soggy
00:23:44.919 ugly looking cigar one puff left in it
00:23:49.279 but you pick it up and you get your one
00:23:50.640 puff disgusting you throw it away but
00:23:52.840 it's free I mean it's cheap and then you
00:23:55.360 look around for another soggy you know
00:23:57.200 one puff cigarette well well that's what
00:23:58.760 I did for years it's a mistake uh
00:24:02.000 although you can make money doing it but
00:24:03.960 you can't make it with big money it's so
00:24:05.279 much easier just to to buy wonderful
00:24:07.200 businesses so now I rather buy a
00:24:08.919 wonderful business at a fair price than
00:24:11.120 a fair business at a wonderful price but
00:24:12.679 in those days I was buying cheap stocks
00:24:14.760 and birkshire was selling below its
00:24:16.840 working capital per share you got the
00:24:18.200 plants for nothing you got the machinery
00:24:19.640 for nothing you got the inventory and
00:24:21.400 receivables at a discount it was cheap
00:24:23.640 so I bought it and 20 years later I was
00:24:27.039 still running a lousy business and that
00:24:29.640 money did not compound you really want
00:24:31.960 to be in a wonderful business cuz the
00:24:33.720 time is the friend of the wonderful
00:24:35.279 business you keep compounding it keeps
00:24:36.840 doing more business and you keep making
00:24:38.600 more money time is the enemy of the
00:24:41.799 lousy business I could have sold
00:24:43.240 Berkshire perhaps liquidated it and made
00:24:45.440 a quick little profit you know one puff
00:24:48.760 but staying with those kind of
00:24:50.039 businesses is is is a big mistake so you
00:24:52.679 might say I learned something out of
00:24:55.640 that mistake and I would have been way
00:24:57.240 better off taking
00:24:59.360 what I did with Burkshire is I kept
00:25:00.559 buying better businesses I started
00:25:02.559 Insurance business Seas candy the
00:25:04.159 Buffalo all all kinds of things I would
00:25:05.919 have been way better doing that with a
00:25:08.600 with a brand new little entity that I'd
00:25:10.840 set up rather than using Burkshire as
00:25:13.120 the platform now I've had a lot of fun
00:25:14.440 out of it I mean everything in life
00:25:16.000 seems to turn out for the better so I I
00:25:17.720 I don't have any complaints about that
00:25:19.360 but it was a dumb thing to do I went
00:25:21.720 into US Air I bought a preferred stock
00:25:24.399 in
00:25:25.960 1989 uh as soon as my check cleared the
00:25:29.840 company went into the red and never got
00:25:31.159 out I mean it was a really dumb I mean
00:25:34.080 it uh I've got an 800 number I call now
00:25:37.240 whenever I think about buying an air
00:25:38.679 airline stock I call them up any hour
00:25:40.799 that fortunately I can call them at 3:
00:25:42.080 in the morning and I just dial and I say
00:25:43.559 my name's Warren I'm an AOH holic you
00:25:45.640 know and I'm thinking about buying this
00:25:47.039 thing and then they talk me down I mean
00:25:49.279 takes takes takes hours sometimes but
00:25:52.080 it's worth it believe me uh if you ever
00:25:54.399 think about that air buying an airline
00:25:55.880 stock call me and I'll give you the 800
00:25:57.279 number cuz you you don't want to do it
00:25:59.799 uh
00:26:01.360 but we got lucky in terms of how we
00:26:04.080 eventually came out on it but it was a
00:26:06.320 dumb dumb decision all mine uh and I've
00:26:11.480 done biggest biggest uh in terms of EV
00:26:16.360 in terms of opportunity cost eventual
00:26:17.919 costs I bought half interest in a
00:26:20.840 Sinclair Filling Station when I was
00:26:22.799 about 20 with a guy I was in the
00:26:23.880 National Guard with and I had about
00:26:25.520 $10,000 then and I put $2,000 in and I
00:26:28.640 lost it all so that was 20% and that
00:26:32.559 means that the opportunity cost is now
00:26:34.200 $6 billion dollar of that of that uh
00:26:36.840 filling station which is big price to
00:26:39.000 pay for you know getting to wipe a few
00:26:41.440 windows and a few windshields and things
00:26:43.960 like that so actually I like it when
00:26:45.520 Berkshire goes down because it reduced
00:26:46.919 the cost of that mistake on an
00:26:49.159 opportunity uh but the biggest mistakes
00:26:52.520 we've made by far I've made not we've
00:26:55.480 made biggest mistakes I've made by far
00:26:58.600 are
00:26:59.840 mistakes of omission and not commission
00:27:03.480 I mean it's the things I knew enough to
00:27:05.440 do they were within my circle of
00:27:07.559 competence and I was sucking my thumb
00:27:10.440 and that is really those are the ones
00:27:12.159 that hurt they don't show up any place I
00:27:14.760 probably cost Burkshire at least $5
00:27:17.840 billion for example by sucking my thumb
00:27:20.760 20 years ago or close to it when Fanny
00:27:22.559 May was was having some troubles and we
00:27:25.159 could have bought the whole company for
00:27:26.320 practically nothing and
00:27:29.120 I don't worry about that if it's
00:27:30.520 Microsoft because I don't know it
00:27:32.120 Microsoft isn't in my circle of
00:27:33.399 competence and so I I I I I don't have
00:27:35.760 any reason to think I'm entitled to make
00:27:37.480 money out of Microsoft or out of cocoa
00:27:39.159 beans or whatever but I did know enough
00:27:42.360 to understand Fanny May and I blew it
00:27:45.000 and that never shows up under
00:27:46.320 conventional accounting but the co I
00:27:48.840 know the cost of it I know I know you
00:27:50.600 know I I passed it up and those are the
00:27:53.960 big big mistakes and uh I've had plenty
00:27:57.320 of them at
00:27:58.919 and you unless I tell you about them in
00:28:01.320 the annual report and I resist the
00:28:03.760 temptation sometimes unless I tell you
00:28:06.039 about them in the annual report you're
00:28:07.519 not going to know it because it doesn't
00:28:08.519 show up under conventional accounting
00:28:10.320 but om mission is way bigger than Co
00:28:12.200 Mission there's big opportunities in
00:28:15.159 life have to be seized uh we don't do
00:28:18.240 very many things but when we get the
00:28:19.679 chance to do something that's right and
00:28:21.120 big we've got to do it and even to do it
00:28:23.919 in a small scale is just as big a
00:28:25.799 mistake almost is not doing it at all I
00:28:27.399 mean if really got to you got to grab
00:28:29.159 them when they come because they you're
00:28:31.399 not going to get 500 great opportunities
00:28:33.919 you would be better off if when you got
00:28:35.519 out of school here you got a punch card
00:28:38.760 with 20 punches on it and every big
00:28:41.559 Financial every financial decision you
00:28:43.200 made you used up a punch you'd get very
00:28:45.679 rich because you'd think through very
00:28:47.640 hard each one of them you went to a
00:28:49.440 cocktail party and somebody talked about
00:28:50.799 a company you didn't even understand
00:28:52.080 what they did or couldn't pronounce the
00:28:53.320 name but they made some money last week
00:28:55.679 and another one like it you wouldn't buy
00:28:57.640 it if you only had 20 punches on that
00:28:59.200 card there's a temptation to dabble if
00:29:02.760 uh particularly during bull markets uh
00:29:05.360 uh in stocks is so easy you know it's
00:29:07.320 easier now than ever because you can do
00:29:08.760 it online you know just you click it in
00:29:10.880 and maybe it goes up a point and get
00:29:12.559 excited about that and you buy another
00:29:13.720 one the next day and so on you can't
00:29:15.519 make any money over time doing that but
00:29:17.760 if you had a punch card with only 20
00:29:19.320 punches you weren't going to get another
00:29:21.080 one in the rest of your life you would
00:29:22.519 think a long time before every
00:29:24.320 investment decision and you would make
00:29:26.919 good ones and you'd make big ones and
00:29:29.360 you probably wouldn't even use all 20
00:29:30.679 punches at the in your lifetime but you
00:29:33.000 wouldn't need to yep Mr Buffett good
00:29:35.919 morning um in your comments about making
00:29:38.120 mistakes and errors like that you talk a
00:29:39.919 little bit about your sell discipline
00:29:41.320 when you're in a position and you you
00:29:42.799 feel like it's no longer good you know
00:29:44.640 what criteria to you use to when you
00:29:46.360 just finally abandon it yeah when I
00:29:48.200 started out the self situation has
00:29:50.159 changed over the years cuz when I
00:29:51.320 started out I had way more ideas than
00:29:53.240 money I mean I would go through Moody's
00:29:55.200 manual I went through it Page by Page
00:29:57.320 and then I went through it again again
00:29:58.360 Page by page and I found stocks in there
00:30:01.000 that I could understand that we selling
00:30:02.320 at like two times earnings even one
00:30:04.039 times earnings well when you only have
00:30:05.559 10,000 bucks that can get a little
00:30:07.120 frustrating and and if you don't like to
00:30:08.600 borrow money which I never like to
00:30:09.960 borrow money so I was always coming up
00:30:12.159 with more ideas than I had money so I
00:30:13.799 had to sell whatever I liked least to
00:30:16.120 buy something new that just was
00:30:17.440 compelling to me and for a long time I
00:30:19.440 was in that mode and now our problem is
00:30:22.279 we have more money than ideas uh so
00:30:25.440 we're if you look at our annual report
00:30:27.679 which is on the uh internet under at our
00:30:30.360 homepage Berkshire out.com you'll see
00:30:32.120 something in the back called the
00:30:33.320 economic principles of birkshire and you
00:30:35.440 will see which I believe in setting out
00:30:37.360 for my my partners they are my partners
00:30:39.559 I don't look at them as shareholders I
00:30:40.679 look at them as partners they're going
00:30:41.679 to be my partners for life so I want to
00:30:43.679 tell them how I think and if they don't
00:30:45.960 agree with the way I think that's fine
00:30:47.720 but I don't want them to I don't want to
00:30:49.080 be disappointed in me you know so I lay
00:30:51.360 out there and I say in terms of our
00:30:52.840 wholly owned businesses we're not going
00:30:54.480 to sell no matter how much anybody
00:30:55.720 offers this form I mean if somebody
00:30:57.480 offers us three times what something is
00:30:59.399 worth se's candy the Buffalo News Bor
00:31:01.720 shimes whatever it may be we're not
00:31:02.880 going to sell it I may be wrong in
00:31:04.600 having that approach I know I'm not
00:31:06.320 wrong if I owned 100% a birer because
00:31:08.600 that's the way I want to live my life
00:31:10.000 I've got all the money I could possibly
00:31:11.440 need you know it just amounts to a a
00:31:13.720 change in the newspaper story on my
00:31:15.559 obituary and the amount of money that
00:31:17.320 the foundation has and to break off
00:31:19.240 relationships with people I like and
00:31:21.200 people that have join me because they
00:31:23.080 think it's a permanent home to do that
00:31:24.880 simply because somebody waves a big
00:31:26.000 check at me would be like selling one of
00:31:27.639 my children because somebody weighed a
00:31:29.000 big check so I won't do that and I want
00:31:31.000 to tell my partners I won't do it so
00:31:32.559 that they're not disappointed me more
00:31:34.960 and more with certain stocks we've got
00:31:37.399 that approach now if we were chronically
00:31:39.880 short of funds and had all kinds of
00:31:41.320 opportunities coming we might have a
00:31:42.720 somewhat different approach but our
00:31:44.120 inclination is not to sell things unless
00:31:46.720 we get really discouraged perhaps with
00:31:49.120 the management or we think the economic
00:31:51.240 characteristics of the business change
00:31:52.799 in a big way I mean and that happens so
00:31:55.519 but we're not going to sell simply
00:31:56.519 because it looks too high in in all
00:31:58.840 likelihood I mean that you can't make
00:32:00.919 that 100% but it's it's uh that's that's
00:32:04.639 that's the principle under which we're
00:32:07.000 operating we're generating right now
00:32:08.799 five billion of cash a year at least so
00:32:11.159 it's 100 million bucks every week and
00:32:13.360 you know just that we've been talking
00:32:14.919 here half an hour and I haven't done a
00:32:16.360 damn thing uh so
00:32:18.880 uh it's you know the real question is
00:32:22.200 how do you put it out intelligently and
00:32:24.760 and if we were selling things it'd be
00:32:26.279 just that much more so there may there
00:32:28.000 there may come a time when that would
00:32:29.240 change but but we want to and I have
00:32:33.000 Partners shareholders Partners who would
00:32:35.880 say if you can get three times what se's
00:32:38.000 candy is worth why don't you sell it and
00:32:40.200 that's why I want to be sure before they
00:32:41.760 come in they know how I think on that I
00:32:44.080 mean they're they're entitled to know
00:32:45.639 that uh you really want think for a
00:32:48.799 minute you know if you're going to get
00:32:49.960 married and you want a marriage that's
00:32:51.720 going to last not necessarily the
00:32:53.480 happiest marriage you know or one that
00:32:55.480 that uh Martha Stewart will talk about
00:32:57.840 or anything but you want a marriage
00:32:59.080 that's going to last what quality do you
00:33:01.080 look for on a spouse one quality do you
00:33:03.840 look for brains do you look for humor do
00:33:07.320 you look for character do you look for
00:33:09.760 beauty
00:33:11.279 no you look for low
00:33:15.039 expectations that is that is the
00:33:17.279 marriage that's going to last both have
00:33:19.799 low expectations I mean it uh uh and I
00:33:23.200 want my partners to be on the low side
00:33:26.000 on expectations coming in because want
00:33:27.960 the marriage to last it's a financial
00:33:29.240 marriage when they join me at Berkshire
00:33:31.399 and I I don't want them to think I'm
00:33:33.200 going to do things that I'm I'm not
00:33:35.159 going to do so that's uh that's our
00:33:37.559 guiding principle theice is all free and
00:33:40.880 your marital advice everything
00:33:42.880 else
00:33:44.480 next good morning Mr Buffett I have a
00:33:47.240 question regarding evaluation of the
00:33:48.960 sness of investment in recent years it
00:33:51.360 appears that the use of uh tax
00:33:54.159 Sheltering incorporation is increasing
00:33:56.360 and such you know companies like ups and
00:33:59.919 others are involved in cold battles over
00:34:03.279 uh shelters with IRS uh and as we know
00:34:07.360 most of these transactions are fairly
00:34:09.440 artificial but yet there is a profit
00:34:12.599 there from the investor perspective do
00:34:14.918 you think it's beneficial for investor
00:34:17.760 that the company that they invest uh are
00:34:20.918 involved in those uh shorters and if so
00:34:24.520 do you think it' be helpful is if those
00:34:27.399 transac
00:34:28.280 disclosed in uh statements meaning the
00:34:31.399 uh notes to statements I'm not sure I
00:34:33.480 got that 100% George could
00:34:37.119 you I I will repeat if you think that uh
00:34:41.839 involvement of corporations that you
00:34:44.239 invest or anybody for that matter invest
00:34:46.560 in tax shelter which is by some
00:34:49.560 definition tax shelters right I've never
00:34:52.359 used one you no no I'm not I'm not
00:34:55.480 saying so I'm asking if you know that
00:34:57.760 that Corporation is involved in uh such
00:35:00.960 activity that is beneficial in short
00:35:03.560 term would you think that that helpful
00:35:06.960 for investors well there's I mean there
00:35:09.240 there's there perfectly legal ways to
00:35:12.640 shelter taxes I mean we we did and still
00:35:16.480 do but we were one of the earliest ones
00:35:18.800 to go in for low-income tax housing
00:35:20.960 credits in fact I met with president
00:35:23.440 first President Bush about about that
00:35:25.400 one and that benefits us to mild degree
00:35:28.760 it it's not a big element uh of birsh I
00:35:31.920 mean it's a penis in terms of
00:35:33.160 berkshire's overall value but it it is a
00:35:36.560 congressionally
00:35:38.200 ordained uh tax benefit I wouldn't call
00:35:41.599 it exactly a shelter it's a tax benefit
00:35:43.599 that Congress has decided they're
00:35:45.079 willing to offer businesses and and
00:35:47.880 because they think it's the best way to
00:35:49.960 to uh generate uh low-income housing so
00:35:53.400 we participate in something but that
00:35:55.240 it's not a it's not a big factor in in
00:35:57.880 in what we do and uh but I don't there's
00:36:01.560 there's nothing wrong with that then if
00:36:02.560 you get into tax evasion I mean that's a
00:36:04.200 whole different game at that point they
00:36:05.480 ought go to jail you know uh but certain
00:36:08.599 businesses some insurance companies
00:36:10.920 reincorporated in
00:36:13.040 Bermuda and you can save a lot of taxes
00:36:15.920 you have to meet certain other tests
00:36:17.400 which we wouldn't want to meet but if we
00:36:19.920 were willing to meet those other tests
00:36:21.880 there's nothing illegal or immoral about
00:36:24.079 us moving to Bermuda we're not going to
00:36:25.720 do it and uh
00:36:28.079 but if if the restrictions weren't there
00:36:30.119 I mean the tax code is the rule book and
00:36:32.800 you follow the rule book I think some of
00:36:34.319 the things people do in terms of bending
00:36:37.119 that rule book get very close to fraud
00:36:40.760 and sometimes cross the line in Def
00:36:42.119 fraud and when they do I think they
00:36:43.160 ought to be be prosecuted uh uh but
00:36:46.960 that's that's another game and inent
00:36:49.319 there has been more pushing on that I
00:36:50.920 would say in the last five years and
00:36:53.000 certainly was my experience earlier and
00:36:55.520 there are more there I think now it's
00:36:58.200 diminishing the last year or twoo but a
00:36:59.680 couple years ago there was some very
00:37:00.880 aggressive marketing by some of the
00:37:03.040 auditing firms and of of these even with
00:37:06.280 share percentage shares of the gain to
00:37:10.240 be paid to the a I think that those
00:37:12.440 things got fairly dubious and
00:37:13.960 particularly when they shopped for legal
00:37:15.480 opinions you know so that if you got
00:37:18.000 caught doing these things you can say
00:37:19.319 well I was relying on this legal opinion
00:37:21.359 and therefore I shouldn't go to jail but
00:37:22.839 just pay the back taxes so I I don't
00:37:25.880 know of any anything worse associated
00:37:27.960 with that has done that but I obviously
00:37:29.760 if they push too far we don't want to be
00:37:31.359 there y I was curious with the uh large
00:37:34.640 number of people you now have with h
00:37:36.720 tremendous amounts of wealth what do you
00:37:38.359 think of the current state of
00:37:39.960 philanthropy well I'll be out this week
00:37:43.400 uh actually I'm going to Coca-Cola
00:37:44.920 meting and I'm flying out to Seattle and
00:37:46.599 and and talking to the United Way group
00:37:48.680 out there they Seattle United Way raises
00:37:50.720 more per capita I believe in the United
00:37:52.440 Way in the country and and Bill Gates
00:37:55.319 will be there we're talking jointly his
00:37:57.760 mother was very active in United Way but
00:38:00.640 Bill uh was going to give away over a
00:38:03.359 billion dollars a year a lot more later
00:38:05.839 on but right now a billion and it's very
00:38:08.040 interesting I mean he is very rational
00:38:09.880 about it and he's very informed in fact
00:38:12.480 he got somebody I think his primary
00:38:14.280 adviser in the medical field is a fellow
00:38:15.760 who was with the CDC in in Atlanta and
00:38:18.880 Bill reads 15 books a a month on this I
00:38:21.480 mean he he he can just absorb it I I
00:38:24.079 wouldn't be able to get it that fast but
00:38:26.200 he just says with a billion he wants to
00:38:28.079 save as many lives per year as he can so
00:38:30.200 how do he that's his objective's it's
00:38:32.400 just as much a metric of his of his
00:38:35.160 foundation as some other metric return
00:38:37.359 on Capital might be for a business and
00:38:39.400 he says I'm going to spend a billion
00:38:40.720 dollars a year how many how many lives
00:38:42.359 can be saved for that so he's gotten
00:38:43.680 very heavily into vaccines and and uh
00:38:46.920 AIDS in Africa a number of things uh
00:38:48.800 it's very rational uh I personally
00:38:52.599 think all of my 99 point something per
00:38:56.480 of my netw worth will go to a foundation
00:39:00.200 after the latter of my wife and I die I
00:39:03.720 mean it's all going to go to a
00:39:04.640 foundation as far as I'm concerned I got
00:39:05.960 it from society it's going to go to
00:39:07.079 society I've written a letter to my
00:39:09.160 trustees and I've got very few trustees
00:39:11.359 if you got a whole bunch of Trustees in
00:39:12.680 my view it they just homogenize
00:39:15.240 themselves down to sort of the lowest
00:39:16.560 common denominator because you get 30
00:39:18.640 people in a room and uh prestigious
00:39:21.400 people but they'll they'll all have
00:39:22.680 their particular alom Moder and they'll
00:39:24.240 all have their particular hospital and
00:39:25.920 it'll become a big trade golf game you
00:39:27.880 know it'll be a little like Congress so
00:39:30.839 uh I have very few people and I don't
00:39:33.440 give them anything specific because I
00:39:35.040 tell them their judgment above ground
00:39:37.160 will be better than my instructions from
00:39:38.680 six feet underground so I don't like to
00:39:41.119 think that but it's true so I tell them
00:39:46.520 look Society are the ones that don't
00:39:50.240 have an actual funding constituency you
00:39:53.000 or are just damned intractable and very
00:39:55.680 difficult to solve so I tell I am not
00:39:57.880 going to haunt them at all if they spend
00:40:01.640 big money on some terribly important
00:40:03.880 problem and they fail because they're
00:40:05.960 taking on tough problems when I buy
00:40:07.760 businesses I'm buying easy businesses
00:40:10.040 but the reason the big problems of
00:40:11.640 society are big problems is that they're
00:40:13.599 damn tough to solve so they are they're
00:40:15.760 swinging at bad pitches I'm swinging at
00:40:17.960 easy pitches in business but they're
00:40:19.200 swinging at they have to swing at bad
00:40:20.760 pitches but I tell them I want them to
00:40:22.640 try and do it and if they fail it
00:40:24.040 doesn't bother me at all I tell them if
00:40:25.720 they give a million bucks a here and a
00:40:27.079 million ion bucks there and a million
00:40:28.240 bucks there they're not going to sleep
00:40:30.280 because I'm going to be haunting them
00:40:31.319 I'm going to come back every night you
00:40:32.760 know I do not want the ey dropper
00:40:34.720 approach used to philanthropy uh but I
00:40:37.680 want them to use their judgment to look
00:40:40.480 at important problems that do not have a
00:40:42.800 natural funding constituency you know if
00:40:45.160 the government's going to fund it fine
00:40:46.480 you know I mean there should be funding
00:40:47.920 important problems but we won't need to
00:40:49.640 do it the role of priv philanthropy in
00:40:52.079 my my opinion is to fund things that
00:40:54.000 don't have the natural constituency and
00:40:56.359 that's what Bill's doing there isn't a
00:40:58.280 there aren't a bunch of people around
00:41:00.599 that you can make an emotional appeal to
00:41:03.720 to make vaccines available to millions
00:41:06.599 and millions of kids around the world it
00:41:08.240 just it doesn't tug at anybody's
00:41:09.800 heartstrings you can't name buildings
00:41:11.400 after them I mean it just isn't the sort
00:41:13.319 of thing that you can raise money for on
00:41:16.160 an emotional basis and there's nothing
00:41:18.240 wrong with raising money on an emotional
00:41:19.720 basis but that is a problem that won't
00:41:22.319 get solved by a funding constituent
00:41:24.160 that's responding to that but Bill is
00:41:26.560 responding to what in his mind is is the
00:41:29.200 important thing which is saving lives
00:41:31.040 and he doesn't care whether he gets his
00:41:32.760 name out a building or whether anything
00:41:34.440 happens or whether anybody knows about
00:41:35.720 it I mean he gets publicity just because
00:41:37.560 of the scale he's on but it he doesn't
00:41:39.560 care about that I can promise you that
00:41:41.160 so that's my philosophy is that I got
00:41:44.520 this money not because I'm a superior
00:41:46.720 human being not because I've done more
00:41:49.560 for society than other people I was
00:41:51.760 wired the right way to be dropped into
00:41:54.800 the United States at this particular
00:41:57.200 particular time I mean it's a huge
00:41:59.359 capitalistic society and I'm wired no
00:42:02.319 credit to me but I just born that way so
00:42:04.880 that I'm better at asset allocation than
00:42:06.720 other people to some degree just like
00:42:08.920 other people are better at all kinds of
00:42:10.280 other things and I was with two teachers
00:42:12.440 out at Sun Valley that are doing more
00:42:14.319 for society than I am and they don't
00:42:16.760 this market system does nothing for them
00:42:19.160 market system does all kinds of things
00:42:20.680 for me gate says if I'd been born 5,000
00:42:23.440 years ago you know I'd have been some
00:42:25.280 animals lunch you know cuz I can't run
00:42:27.200 very fast and can't climb trees I mean
00:42:29.640 you know what those and I could I could
00:42:31.520 tell that animal was chasing me in a
00:42:33.319 wait till see how I can allocate assets
00:42:34.920 you
00:42:36.000 know it wouldn't have made any
00:42:37.760 difference so here I am you know I'm
00:42:40.480 born now you know I just very very lucky
00:42:43.319 and the odds when I was born in 1930 the
00:42:45.440 odds were 50 to1 against me being born
00:42:47.240 in the United States that's a terrible
00:42:48.920 set of odds to face and yet I was
00:42:50.400 dropped down here you know and if I'd
00:42:52.319 been dropped down in Peru or someplace
00:42:54.040 or or China I mean I wouldn't have had a
00:42:56.760 chance so Society is what does it for
00:42:59.480 you and and uh it should go back in my
00:43:01.960 view it should go back to society if
00:43:03.640 you've been lucky enough to be dropped
00:43:06.200 into a society where your particular
00:43:08.480 wiring pays off big you know it that uh
00:43:12.040 that's just luck and and uh you know
00:43:14.480 there's nothing wrong with being lucky I
00:43:15.800 don't feel guilty about or anything else
00:43:17.559 but I also don't feel that I feel I have
00:43:19.480 a lot of fun doing what I do but I feel
00:43:21.800 the money should go back into society
00:43:23.359 and it should go back as intelligently
00:43:24.960 as it can and best way to do do it
00:43:27.359 intelligently is to have highgrade and
00:43:30.359 intelligent people administering it uh
00:43:33.800 at the time and you don't know the
00:43:35.800 problems that are going to be out there
00:43:37.000 10 years from now or 20 years from now
00:43:38.640 or 30 years from now but I do know if
00:43:40.839 I've got a small number of high-grade
00:43:43.240 smart people and high grade is more
00:43:45.880 important I'll I'll if you gave me 20
00:43:48.559 extra points of IQ but but cheated a
00:43:50.559 little on the high grade I wouldn't take
00:43:51.839 it because they got to be they got to be
00:43:54.480 there's so many chances to to do things
00:43:57.200 in a petty way or you know to try to I
00:44:00.920 mean people get subverted in their own
00:44:02.520 minds to their own interest rather than
00:44:04.200 the interests of the institution so I
00:44:05.960 really want super high-grade people
00:44:07.359 doing it and I've got them and I think
00:44:10.559 the money might do a lot of good it may
00:44:12.280 do no good but it'll be operating in
00:44:15.160 fields where if it does some good that
00:44:17.359 good probably wouldn't have been done
00:44:18.640 otherwise
00:44:20.559 yep I was just wondering um there's a
00:44:23.680 lot of differences between the recent
00:44:25.640 boom and bust and stock market and one
00:44:27.839 in the 1920s uh but there's also a lot
00:44:30.160 of similarities and those similarities
00:44:32.440 are are allowing people to draw the
00:44:34.040 conclusion that uh stock prices will be
00:44:36.680 depressed for uh some time to come what
00:44:40.319 where do you disagree and agree with
00:44:41.599 that conclusion well the the whole
00:44:43.880 century is quite interesting if you take
00:44:46.240 the 20th
00:44:47.400 century it was an unbelievable Century
00:44:50.160 for the United States the GDP per capita
00:44:53.640 and that's the way to think of it as per
00:44:54.800 capita sometimes they talk about our GDP
00:44:56.280 versus Europe's but if their
00:44:57.920 population's the same every year and
00:44:59.520 ours goes up 1% you've got to you know
00:45:01.880 in the end you got to you got to have a
00:45:03.720 divisor as well as a numerator and so
00:45:06.920 GDP per capita in the 20th century in
00:45:09.119 the United States went up 610 per.
00:45:12.280 actually qualitatively it went up far
00:45:14.079 more than that because you can't really
00:45:15.559 measure you know certain things uh in
00:45:17.760 medicine or whatever it may be and
00:45:19.559 improvements but just on a quantitative
00:45:21.559 basis it went up every single decade
00:45:23.760 including the decade of the 30s so here
00:45:26.760 you had a 100 years when basically the
00:45:30.839 US citizenry was getting was improving
00:45:33.480 their lot decade by decade by decade the
00:45:35.880 30s it was up
00:45:37.599 13% uh best decade was World War II the
00:45:41.319 40s was up 36% the worst decade was the
00:45:44.200 first world war so you get sometimes the
00:45:46.480 anal you know you can get in trouble on
00:45:47.920 analogies but in any event it was it was
00:45:49.640 a huge period interestingly enough there
00:45:52.720 were six big periods in there for the
00:45:55.760 stock market in both directions there
00:45:58.440 were three big bull market from 1900 to
00:46:01.800 1921 the Dow went from 66 to 71 less
00:46:06.359 than a 10% move in 20 years less than
00:46:10.359 half a percent a year you got dividends
00:46:11.839 too but a half a so it didn't move from
00:46:14.520 21 to 29 as you point out it went it
00:46:17.319 went from 71 to a high of 381 in
00:46:20.000 September of 1929 went up 500% well
00:46:24.240 obviously the the wellbeing of the
00:46:26.160 country didn't go up 5 00% during that
00:46:27.839 period and the well-being of the company
00:46:29.720 country went up a whole lot more than
00:46:31.680 10% during that first 21 years so he got
00:46:34.240 this very uneven development then from
00:46:35.680 19 from September
00:46:37.599 1929 until the end of
00:46:39.920 1948 the Dow went from 381 to about 180
00:46:44.440 was cut in half and that was 18 long
00:46:48.040 years and yet the per capita GDP was
00:46:50.960 moving right up during this whole period
00:46:52.559 so the economy was doing fine from 48 to
00:46:55.200 65 the Dow went again from about 180 up
00:46:58.839 to close to 1,000 again 5 for one which
00:47:01.400 was far out stripping it from 65 to 81
00:47:05.559 the Dow went down literally well again
00:47:09.960 per capita GP and then we've had this
00:47:11.640 last period where it's gone up
00:47:12.839 terrifically if you take the whole
00:47:14.240 hundred years it went up10 for one every
00:47:17.359 ,000 became 180,000 but 43 and a quarter
00:47:21.520 year 43 and 3/4 years were those three
00:47:24.440 big huge bull markets and 56 and a
00:47:27.800 quarter years were periods of
00:47:30.160 stagnation all in an economy that was
00:47:32.559 doing fine you know year after year
00:47:34.599 after year 56 and a quarter years net
00:47:37.559 the Dow was down a couple hundred points
00:47:39.240 during that period and the other 43 and
00:47:41.319 3/4 years made up the rest of this move
00:47:43.760 from 66 to 11,000 somewh on the Dallas
00:47:47.640 so you say to yourself how could it be
00:47:50.640 that you could have a country that was
00:47:52.200 doing better and better and better and
00:47:53.720 better citizens were living every every
00:47:56.280 generation was was living better than
00:47:57.800 the one that preceded it but you had
00:47:59.920 these huge changes big gains a few times
00:48:03.880 long periods of stagnation 20 years I
00:48:06.800 mean that's a long time to do nothing
00:48:08.480 the answer is that investors behave in
00:48:11.760 very human ways which is they get very
00:48:13.720 excited during bull markets and they
00:48:16.200 look in the rearview mirror and they say
00:48:17.800 I made money last year I'm going to make
00:48:19.760 more money this year so this time I'll
00:48:21.079 borrow you know or or the neighbor says
00:48:23.880 you know I wasn't in last year when that
00:48:26.079 neighbor was Dumber than I have made a
00:48:27.359 lot of money so I'm going to go in this
00:48:28.800 year so they're always looking in the
00:48:29.760 rearview mirror and when they look in
00:48:31.920 the rearview mirror and they see a lot
00:48:33.160 of money having been made in the last
00:48:34.680 few years they plow in and they just
00:48:36.599 push and push and push on prices and
00:48:39.079 when they look in the rview mirror and
00:48:40.400 they see no money having been made they
00:48:42.599 just say this is a lousy place to be so
00:48:44.480 they don't care what's going on in the
00:48:46.480 underlying business and it's it's
00:48:48.040 astounding but that's that makes for
00:48:50.079 huge opportunity just huge opportunity I
00:48:53.359 mean I lived through roughly half in an
00:48:55.319 investing sense about half that period
00:48:57.520 and I've had that long period of
00:49:00.440 stagnation from
00:49:02.319 48 uh I mean from 65 uh to 82 17 years I
00:49:07.720 wrote an article for Forbes in 1979 I
00:49:10.480 just said how can this be Pension funds
00:49:13.200 in the in 1970 put 10 and some per of
00:49:15.760 their new money in stock because they
00:49:17.200 were wild about stocks then they got a
00:49:19.319 lot cheaper and they put a record low in
00:49:21.760 9% of their net new money in in 1978
00:49:23.880 when stocks were way cheaper people
00:49:25.359 behave very peculiarly
00:49:27.680 in in in terms of the reactions because
00:49:29.640 they they're human beings and they they
00:49:31.680 get excited when others get excited they
00:49:33.319 get greedy when others get greedy they
00:49:34.760 get fearful when others get fearful and
00:49:36.760 they'll continue to do so and you will
00:49:39.760 you know you will see things you won't
00:49:41.280 believe in your lifetime and securities
00:49:44.160 markets and the country will do very
00:49:46.079 well over time but you will see these
00:49:47.960 huge waves and and uh if you can stay
00:49:52.680 objective throughout that if you can
00:49:55.200 detach yourself tempor mentally from the
00:49:57.920 crowd you get very rich and you won't
00:50:00.799 have to be be very bright I mean it I'm
00:50:02.960 sure you are but but you want you know
00:50:05.920 it just it doesn't take brains it takes
00:50:07.799 temperament it takes the ability to sit
00:50:10.880 there and look at something when I
00:50:12.680 started out in 1950 I would go through
00:50:14.960 and find things at two times earnings
00:50:16.400 and they were perfectly decent
00:50:17.480 businesses and people wanted jobs at
00:50:19.079 those companies and everybody knew they
00:50:20.599 were going to be around and they
00:50:22.119 wouldn't buy them at two times earnings
00:50:23.359 and that's when interest rates were 2
00:50:24.559 and a half% you know I went to the I
00:50:27.520 started selling securities when I was 21
00:50:30.119 and a Kansas City Life Insurance Company
00:50:32.559 happened to be fairly prominent company
00:50:34.240 in Omaha and the policies they sold you
00:50:38.880 if you were buying life insurance from
00:50:40.240 them had a buildin Assumption of 2%
00:50:43.160 interest the stock of Kansas City life
00:50:46.520 was selling at less than three times
00:50:48.599 earnings you were getting 35% if you
00:50:50.760 bought the stock no question about the
00:50:52.799 soundness of the company I went to the
00:50:54.599 local agent I I fig ought be able to
00:50:57.200 sell him a few shares of stock I mean
00:50:58.599 the guy understand I he's got his whole
00:51:00.319 life invested in this company I went to
00:51:01.760 local agent who' been with him for 20
00:51:04.079 years as his name was moose I said Mr
00:51:06.680 moose I said you know you're selling
00:51:08.880 these policies with 2% you may even have
00:51:10.520 a few on members of your own family and
00:51:12.000 you can buy into this company whose
00:51:14.240 paycheck you depend on every month and
00:51:15.920 you and whose future you your your
00:51:17.920 beneficiaries of these Life policies
00:51:19.520 depend on and who you're selling them
00:51:21.640 you know a 2% investment on and you can
00:51:23.599 get 35% on your money and you know
00:51:27.119 stocks aren't any good and and I
00:51:29.359 couldn't I couldn't sell the you know I
00:51:30.720 was a lousy salesman I mean well you
00:51:32.319 have to start with that but but uh it it
00:51:34.839 just blew me away it blew me away I
00:51:36.920 thought sometimes I used to wonder if I
00:51:38.440 was nuts you know but those things the
00:51:41.319 same thing happened I mean in
00:51:43.760 1964 the dowal closed at 8
00:51:46.920 864 at the end of 1981 17 years later
00:51:50.720 later it closed at 865 it moved one
00:51:52.799 point in 17 years now that's not a big
00:51:54.720 move and that you you can't believe the
00:51:59.720 how how discouraged people were by that
00:52:02.440 by during that period but you know
00:52:05.119 people were living better uh so things
00:52:08.359 can go on a long time that don't make
00:52:11.799 sense and but they do come to an end I
00:52:14.920 mean the internet thing I mean you had
00:52:16.319 these companies selling for many
00:52:17.599 billions of dollars that had no really
00:52:20.200 practically no prospects of making any
00:52:21.680 money that that's a that's a bubble but
00:52:23.720 herbstein one time said anything that
00:52:25.680 can't go on for forever will end now
00:52:28.480 that seems pretty but think about that
00:52:31.119 and uh particularly think about it next
00:52:33.040 time you're inclined to do something
00:52:34.319 just cuz the Stock's gone up a whole lot
00:52:36.480 you know and your neighbors made money
00:52:38.079 or something it uh you've got to be you
00:52:41.359 just have to sit and think objectively
00:52:42.960 and think about would I buy this whole
00:52:45.520 business it's an internet company's got
00:52:48.280 100 million shares out and selling 100
00:52:49.960 that's 10 billion do is it worth1
00:52:52.160 billion if it's worth 1010 billion it's
00:52:54.599 got to be able to give you you know 7 or
00:52:57.400 800 million next year and if it doesn't
00:53:00.200 give you 7 or 800 million next year it
00:53:02.119 has to give you maybe 10% more than that
00:53:04.160 the year after and continue to be there
00:53:06.280 aren't a lot of businesses that can do
00:53:07.599 that and people just go crazy and of
00:53:11.319 course it's fun I mean it's you know
00:53:13.960 it's like that sign they they put in
00:53:16.520 brokerage offices it says avoid
00:53:18.400 hangovers stay drunk you know I mean
00:53:21.359 it's it's just so much fun to keep
00:53:22.680 playing but uh you got to you got to do
00:53:25.200 sensible things to get to get good
00:53:26.880 results yeah yeah next well we got three
00:53:30.480 people standing there so let's let's do
00:53:31.839 the three that are standing there okay
00:53:33.200 good morning sir hi hi I was wondering
00:53:35.960 um what your opinion is of the Federal
00:53:37.559 Reserve and their actions taken recently
00:53:39.640 do you feel they've done enough to boost
00:53:41.119 the economy yeah well I'm a I'm a fan of
00:53:43.359 Allen greenspans over time I've known
00:53:44.880 him for a long long time we were on a
00:53:46.200 board together at cap cities and Allen
00:53:48.400 is a very very smart guy he is motivated
00:53:51.880 in my opinion entirely by what is good
00:53:54.240 for the United States people of the
00:53:55.839 United States and so you've got a you've
00:53:57.720 got you couldn't have a better person in
00:53:59.400 there and the
00:54:02.400 problem he may have is that that because
00:54:06.880 his tenure in office has been associated
00:54:09.160 with this incredible bull market that
00:54:12.280 that even though he wouldn't have
00:54:13.640 claimed credit for it that people might
00:54:15.839 associate it because of the importance
00:54:17.280 of the FED generally they might
00:54:18.720 associate with him so they may if things
00:54:20.680 don't work out so well they may blame
00:54:22.000 him as well but I think his policy has
00:54:23.599 generally been very good you have to
00:54:25.520 understand one thing
00:54:27.240 about the FED is
00:54:29.640 that it's not as powerful as the
00:54:31.960 Mystique would make it it's brake is
00:54:35.000 better than its gas pedal when the FED
00:54:38.280 wants to put on the brakes we go through
00:54:40.960 the windshield I mean you know the
00:54:42.880 economy just yeah H they can put on the
00:54:45.880 brakes Paul vuler did it he broke
00:54:48.640 inflation by doing it but I mean when he
00:54:50.359 put on the brakes in that period around
00:54:53.680 1980 I mean people hated he's crucified
00:54:56.160 for but it was the right thing to do and
00:54:58.119 he could do it he did it all by himself
00:55:00.680 and he's he and and it was the only way
00:55:03.119 because of the momentum that inflation
00:55:04.640 was generating it was the only thing
00:55:06.160 that it was what was needed then
00:55:08.440 enormously unpopular it's much harder
00:55:11.720 for a green span to put on the brakes
00:55:14.079 because nobody wants him to put on the
00:55:15.720 brakes plus he's so visible but he's put
00:55:19.920 him on sort of
00:55:21.319 gradually uh but stepping on the gas
00:55:24.200 pedal he does not necessarily get the
00:55:25.960 same result it may
00:55:28.760 help but there are thousand other
00:55:31.280 variables operating and as you see in
00:55:33.720 Japan you know you can get down to zero
00:55:35.880 interest rates and you can't stimulate
00:55:37.880 anything so it isn't like the Japanese
00:55:40.640 haven't read the same books we've read
00:55:42.000 about economics I mean they've read
00:55:43.920 canes and they've read the whole thing
00:55:45.480 so we're not smarter than they are we
00:55:47.880 don't have any secrets they don't have
00:55:49.839 but they don't know how to get their
00:55:51.319 economy going and uh you know there J
00:55:55.400 GDP there has been gone no place you
00:55:57.680 know in The Last 5 Years and there's
00:55:59.680 still problems around so easy money
00:56:02.000 doesn't solve everything but green span
00:56:04.640 could very well get blamed for the fact
00:56:07.400 that that he hasn't solved everything
00:56:09.640 and it's just not in his power to solve
00:56:11.640 it uh he can help in various ways and I
00:56:14.319 but I I don't think you could have
00:56:15.599 anybody bu better and I think he's done
00:56:17.760 the right thing to this point but the
00:56:20.039 right thing may not be quite as as
00:56:22.200 effective as as people may hope that it
00:56:24.039 would
00:56:25.000 be and economics is always you always
00:56:28.000 want to ask and then what you'll read in
00:56:30.720 the paper well what happens if the
00:56:32.039 Japanese start selling government our
00:56:34.359 government bonds or what happened if
00:56:35.680 they dump the dollar they can't dump the
00:56:37.839 dollar there's no way to dump dollars
00:56:39.559 you can you can at least dollar assets
00:56:42.000 because if the Japanese want to sell
00:56:43.680 government our government bonds they
00:56:46.160 sell them to us you know they get a time
00:56:48.039 deposit or a demand deposited City or
00:56:50.359 they still own a dollar asset if they
00:56:52.400 sell them to the French they get they
00:56:54.079 may get some assets from the French but
00:56:55.520 now the French have it but I mean the
00:56:57.039 only way you can reduce foreign
00:57:01.079 investment in the United States is to
00:57:03.039 change it around so they're consuming
00:57:05.480 more than from us more than we're
00:57:07.000 consuming from them I mean when when
00:57:09.079 when we buy a television set from Japan
00:57:12.200 if we buy more television sets from them
00:57:14.280 than they buy equivalent consumables
00:57:16.240 from us the exchange what balances
00:57:18.960 things is we give them some investment
00:57:21.920 type asset whether it's cash or US
00:57:23.960 Government Bond or our stocks or our Mo
00:57:25.799 Movies Studios or our real estate or
00:57:27.960 different things and the only way that
00:57:30.240 reverses is when we start running a
00:57:33.280 trade surplus which we're miles away
00:57:35.039 from so
00:57:36.559 logically you know if you read classic
00:57:38.880 economics that uh you would believe that
00:57:41.559 our currency would have been weak along
00:57:44.319 or
00:57:45.680 weaker uh over the recent years and that
00:57:48.880 it would be weak now but there are other
00:57:51.760 things operating and that's one of the
00:57:53.200 problems about economics is there's
00:57:54.599 never just one variable there's usually
00:57:56.960 hundreds of variables and they operate
00:58:00.319 with different
00:58:01.559 impact at different times I mean it's a
00:58:04.680 it's it's not like a physics formula I
00:58:06.240 mean well I guess it would be if you got
00:58:07.640 in the Heisenberg Principle or something
00:58:09.079 like that but but the the
00:58:13.000 formula has a lot of the same variables
00:58:15.440 year after year but the relative
00:58:17.960 importance of those variables and how
00:58:19.359 they interact with each other is is
00:58:21.599 never exactly the same and that's what
00:58:23.119 we find out the Japanese find out
00:58:24.720 everybody finds out and and foreign
00:58:26.920 currency or the Curren the value of our
00:58:29.200 dollar and currency rates are defying
00:58:32.119 what you would expect based on history
00:58:35.480 but as somebody said if history were a
00:58:36.920 perfect guide you know the fors 400
00:58:39.240 would all be Librarians you know they
00:58:41.079 just go look it up in the books and
00:58:42.319 they'd always know all the answers but
00:58:44.440 uh it history doesn't repeat itself as
00:58:47.559 Mark Twain said history doesn't repeat
00:58:49.039 itself but it Rhymes I mean things come
00:58:51.359 back but they don't quite come back in
00:58:52.799 the same form and we'll understand all
00:58:54.400 this perfectly in a few more years why
00:58:56.200 the dollars behave the way it has but I
00:58:58.440 I think it would be useful net for the
00:59:01.400 us if the dollar were less
00:59:04.920 strong yes Mr Buffett thanks for taking
00:59:07.280 my question um my question pertains to
00:59:09.960 small business and my family's been in
00:59:12.599 uh the truckload sector of
00:59:14.039 transportation for about 50 years and as
00:59:16.559 you talked about the airline industry
00:59:18.200 and all the mergers and Acquisitions and
00:59:20.680 things going on and a lot of the smaller
00:59:22.920 players being uh tossed out of the
00:59:25.440 market uh what do you see for people
00:59:27.760 that um like in this room for students
00:59:29.599 that want to start a small business and
00:59:32.319 maybe they want to start in a business
00:59:34.079 that is a somewhat of a commodity type
00:59:36.119 business but as businesses the large
00:59:38.799 corporations get larger and their
00:59:40.839 efficiencies increas how can a small
00:59:43.440 business
00:59:45.160 compete these people yeah the the in
00:59:49.359 many areas small businesses have an
00:59:51.359 advantage you know and other businesses
00:59:53.280 scale has a huge advantage and I mean
00:59:56.240 you don't want to be a a tiny carbon
00:59:58.599 steel producer on the other hand when
01:00:00.079 mini Mills came along and learned how to
01:00:01.839 use scrap more effectively than than the
01:00:04.640 the older methods of making steel they
01:00:06.760 actually had an advantage so scale is a
01:00:08.920 huge advantage in some businesses it's
01:00:12.559 you know the largest Airlines haven't
01:00:13.920 won Southwest Airlines has won starting
01:00:15.960 with you know just a few planes flying
01:00:17.440 down there between Houston and Dallas
01:00:19.000 and and they have become bigger but
01:00:22.559 their ambition hasn't been to be the
01:00:24.200 biggest and you know they they probably
01:00:26.520 buy their fuel just as cheap as United
01:00:28.280 and they probably bought it you know
01:00:29.160 when they're a lot smaller Walmart is a
01:00:30.720 classic example I mean who would have
01:00:32.880 thought 25 years ago 30 years ago I mean
01:00:36.720 here was Sears with a 100 story plus
01:00:38.839 building in Chicago had access to money
01:00:41.960 far cheaper than Sam Walton I mean Sam
01:00:43.640 Walton's credit was not as good as Sears
01:00:45.640 every supplier wanted to do business
01:00:47.160 with Sears nobody had ever heard of Sam
01:00:49.240 every real estate developer who was
01:00:50.599 developing a new shopping center went
01:00:51.960 first to Sears you know and Sam got a
01:00:55.160 short end so here's the guy starting in
01:00:57.520 Bentonville Arkansas and he kills them
01:01:00.400 over time just playing kills them and
01:01:02.599 disadvantage in buying disadvantage in
01:01:04.680 borrowing disadvantage in real estate
01:01:07.280 Advantage Sam Walton and his ability to
01:01:10.559 inspire in the end hundreds of thousands
01:01:13.000 of people to be enthusiastic about going
01:01:15.319 to work and doing all the doing the
01:01:16.680 right things over time so I would be
01:01:18.839 just as optimistic about small business
01:01:22.079 generally now there's certain areas uh
01:01:24.880 where scale just as is just plain
01:01:26.920 important but but I see no disadvantage
01:01:29.440 we intentionally at birkshire we have
01:01:32.640 112,000 employes more in Georgia than in
01:01:35.599 any other state of the union
01:01:36.559 incidentally uh uh we employ a lot up
01:01:40.520 near Dalton and we employ a lot of
01:01:42.079 people in making it Geico and we
01:01:45.079 intentionally with our
01:01:46.880 112,000 we probably have I don't know
01:01:49.079 how many business units but lots and we
01:01:51.680 only have 13.8 people at headquarters
01:01:54.559 I'm not the point8 in said that I resent
01:01:56.720 it when people think that I'm a full but
01:01:58.599 we have one woman that works four days a
01:01:59.880 week and that's all we have at
01:02:01.160 headquarters 112,000 people 105 billion
01:02:04.520 of market cap but we intentionally keep
01:02:07.400 our units small we think we we want them
01:02:11.559 to have the nimbleness the
01:02:13.760 responsiveness to the customer
01:02:15.440 particularly that will turn them you
01:02:18.400 know that essentially will more than
01:02:21.279 offset anything that the scale of having
01:02:24.440 maybe a little more purchasing power or
01:02:26.000 something will develop we own a home
01:02:28.319 furnishing we have Furniture Home
01:02:29.839 Furnishing business in Utah run by a
01:02:32.039 fellow named Bill child he was featured
01:02:33.680 in Fortune about one issue ago that the
01:02:37.359 the cover story was God and business it
01:02:39.079 was and it was Bill was the number one
01:02:41.559 illustration Bill took that business
01:02:44.039 from his father-in-law when it was doing
01:02:46.000 $250,000 a year and then now was over
01:02:48.760 half the business in Utah in his field
01:02:50.359 about close to 400 million he built it
01:02:52.880 by thinking about the customer and the
01:02:54.520 truth he was competing with Sears he was
01:02:57.039 competing uh with Levitz was a huge
01:02:59.640 Furniture retailer in the past he was
01:03:01.720 competing with everybody but all he
01:03:04.440 thought about from the moment he got up
01:03:05.599 in the morning was how do I take care of
01:03:07.640 my customer and that wins we have a
01:03:10.359 business in Omaha some of you may have
01:03:12.720 heard
01:03:13.440 of it's the largest home furnishing
01:03:15.680 store in the world in alaha which only
01:03:19.079 has a smsa of 650,000 people it's on 72
01:03:24.200 Acres it's the $325 million in one
01:03:29.160 location which happens to be $500 for
01:03:31.839 every man woman and child in the smsa
01:03:33.799 but it draws from Beyond that that
01:03:35.440 business comes about or has resulted
01:03:40.240 from an investment of $500 in
01:03:43.760 1937 by a woman who walked out of Russia
01:03:47.880 in
01:03:48.760 1921 she land she walked out got on a
01:03:51.559 peanut boat landed in Seattle with a tag
01:03:55.160 around her neck she couldn't speak one
01:03:56.520 word of English the American Red Cross
01:03:58.720 looked at the tag it said Fort Dodge
01:04:00.240 Iowa they got her at Fort Dodge Iowa she
01:04:03.000 couldn't pick up the language she was
01:04:04.720 there two years she said she felt like a
01:04:06.680 dummy so she came to Alo because there
01:04:08.760 were other Russian Jews there and she'd
01:04:10.160 at least have somebody to talk to her
01:04:11.599 little girl started school Francis
01:04:14.039 Francis would come home at night and
01:04:16.000 teach her mother the words she learned
01:04:17.480 in school that day that's how this woman
01:04:19.240 Rose blump can learn the English
01:04:20.799 language but from her from her daughter
01:04:22.839 from kindergarten on teaching her the
01:04:24.400 words
01:04:25.960 she brought seven siblings over from
01:04:28.240 Russia one at a time 50 bucks every time
01:04:30.520 she saved 50 bucks she sold used
01:04:32.000 clothing and other
01:04:33.720 works she got her seven siblings over
01:04:36.119 her mother and father and by 1937 16
01:04:39.279 years after she got here she saved $500
01:04:42.200 she got on a train went to Chicago to
01:04:45.200 the American Furniture Mart which was
01:04:46.920 this huge impressive thing she had this
01:04:49.960 she was smart as hell but she thought
01:04:51.200 like a peasant in a way and she saw this
01:04:52.720 building and she decided to name her
01:04:54.160 company the Nebraska Furniture she went
01:04:56.119 and bought $500 worth of she bought
01:04:58.520 about $22,000 worth of merchandise all
01:05:01.799 the way back to Omaha she worried
01:05:03.480 because she thought I owe
01:05:05.000 $1,500 and she only had a $500 Equity so
01:05:07.799 she got to Omaha she took the bed the
01:05:11.640 sofa the refrigerator out of her own
01:05:14.079 home to sell fast so she could get the
01:05:17.319 money so she could pay on time she took
01:05:19.319 that business and build it from that
01:05:21.240 start no one would sell to her she went
01:05:23.720 into court four times because they tried
01:05:25.880 to the carpet manufacturers tried to
01:05:27.799 keep her from selling at a discount and
01:05:29.240 she went into court and told the judge
01:05:32.839 cuz she figured out ways to buy this
01:05:34.160 stuff in various nefarious ways from
01:05:36.559 other had other people buy it for and
01:05:37.960 she said look it I pay $3 a yard for
01:05:40.160 this carpet brand I sells it for $6.98
01:05:42.760 she says I sell it for 3.98 just tell me
01:05:45.160 judge how much you want me to rob people
01:05:46.680 she defended herself papers wrote it up
01:05:48.640 the judge bought carpet from her the
01:05:49.880 next day I mean it was it was marvelous
01:05:52.559 brandise isn't selling anymore they were
01:05:54.200 the huge department store in she put
01:05:56.359 everybody out of business and the
01:05:57.680 punchline she worked till she was 103
01:06:00.400 she sold me the business when she was
01:06:02.400 89 and she didn't have she didn't have
01:06:05.520 an audit I went out this year at one
01:06:08.160 afternoon I took a check out with me and
01:06:10.440 because I knew she wanted to do
01:06:11.440 something and I said Mrs B here's the
01:06:13.640 money I said I don't need an audit just
01:06:15.319 tell me whether you owe any money she
01:06:16.599 said I've never owed any money since I
01:06:17.920 owed those guys back in 1937 and she
01:06:20.440 said it's all free and clear she'd never
01:06:22.720 seen a balance sheet she didn't know
01:06:24.559 what counting terms meant but she
01:06:27.000 understood the nature of the business
01:06:29.440 and I told her I said I'd rather have
01:06:31.079 I'd rather have your word you know than
01:06:33.480 an audit from every one of the big six
01:06:35.880 or big eight or whatever they were
01:06:37.160 number at the time of the top auditing
01:06:39.200 firms and and she worked till she was
01:06:41.880 103 she died at
01:06:44.559 104 she had three siblings at her
01:06:47.119 funeral I mean those are some jeans her
01:06:49.440 son works there now he's 82 or three and
01:06:52.039 the three sisters are all alive but the
01:06:54.240 punchline is
01:06:56.079 she couldn't read or right this woman
01:06:58.720 could not read or right if you told her
01:07:00.160 this room was 68 ft
01:07:02.319 by 43 she would tell you how many square
01:07:05.359 yards it was like that she never went to
01:07:07.200 school a day in her life she would tell
01:07:09.079 you how how much that was at 5.98 a
01:07:11.119 yards she'd add the tax she'd knock off
01:07:13.079 something cuz she liked your looks and
01:07:15.200 that would be it and that that's you
01:07:17.799 know that is the that you can't beat
01:07:21.079 that you know and and you can't
01:07:23.039 replicate that at General Motors you
01:07:25.319 can't can't institutionalize that the
01:07:27.680 the person who brings that kind of drive
01:07:30.640 to a business and does it day after day
01:07:34.400 and thinks about their
01:07:35.960 customer uh and that's all she did can't
01:07:39.720 and well she raised four kids in the
01:07:41.119 process too but you can't it it can't
01:07:43.359 miss and no you don't have to worry if
01:07:45.799 you're an
01:07:47.119 entrepreneur in most Fields there's some
01:07:49.480 Fields where you can't do it because
01:07:51.000 there are scale aspects to it but in
01:07:53.279 most Fields you know you'll you'll kill
01:07:55.720 people Bob Shaw did that was with Shaw
01:07:57.920 nobody ever heard of Shaw in carpet 30
01:08:00.079 years ago and he's got 40% of the carpet
01:08:01.720 business in the country uh so don't I
01:08:04.880 it's it's a great field of opportunity
01:08:06.480 out there and I uh uh I don't know about
01:08:09.520 Trucking specifically but I wish you the
01:08:11.079 best on it and you're you won't be at a
01:08:13.240 disadvantage in many fields if if you're
01:08:15.200 small and you'll actually have an
01:08:18.000 advantage thank
01:08:24.279 you okay oh
