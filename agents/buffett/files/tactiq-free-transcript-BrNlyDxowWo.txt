# https://www.youtube.com/watch/BrNlyDxowWo

00:00:00.760 are you seeing signs of inflation
00:00:02.360 beginning to increase we're seeing very
00:00:04.640 substantial inflation it's very
00:00:06.000 interesting we're raising prices people
00:00:08.080 raising prices to us it's being accepted
00:00:10.639 I mean it's not you know take home
00:00:12.719 building I mean you know the cost of
00:00:15.120 we've got nine home builders in addition
00:00:16.800 to our manufactured housing thing and
00:00:18.480 then uh operation which is the largest
00:00:20.720 in the country so we really do a lot of
00:00:22.320 Housing and the costs are just up up up
00:00:26.679 steel costs just every day they're going
00:00:29.359 up and there hasn't yet been because the
00:00:31.840 wage stuff follows I mean if the UAW
00:00:34.680 writes a three-year contract we got a
00:00:36.079 three-year contract but if you're buying
00:00:37.960 steel at General Motors or someplace
00:00:40.520 you're paying more every day so it's an
00:00:43.039 economy really it's red hot I mean and
00:00:45.719 we weren't expecting it I mean all our
00:00:47.879 companies when they they thought when
00:00:49.760 we're allowed to go back to work you
00:00:51.239 know at our various operations we closed
00:00:54.039 the furniture stores I mentioned you
00:00:55.520 know they were closed for 6 weeks or so
00:00:57.879 on average and they didn't know what was
00:00:59.559 going to happen when they when they open
00:01:01.239 them and you know they can't stop people
00:01:03.600 from buying things and we can't deliver
00:01:05.880 them and they say well that's okay
00:01:07.040 because nobody else can deliver them
00:01:08.159 either and we'll wait for 3 months or
00:01:10.119 something of the sort that the backlog
00:01:11.439 grows and then we thought it would end
00:01:13.600 when the $600 payments ended it just
00:01:16.320 kept going and it it keeps going and it
00:01:18.439 keeps going and it keeps going and I get
00:01:20.159 the figures every week I call for blump
00:01:23.960 calls me and we go over day by day what
00:01:25.960 happened in three different stores in
00:01:27.640 Chicago and Kansas City and Dallas and
00:01:30.159 it just won't stop uh people have money
00:01:32.520 in their pocket and and they pay the
00:01:35.159 higher prices and on carpet prices go up
00:01:39.320 in a month or two you know we announced
00:01:41.479 a price increase for our costs are going
00:01:44.200 up Supply chains all screwed up you know
00:01:46.719 for all kinds of people but it's almost
00:01:49.439 a buying frenzy except certain areas you
00:01:52.320 can't buy yet you you know you really
00:01:54.079 can't buy international air travel and
00:01:55.920 there's so the money is being diverted
00:01:58.719 from a little a piece of the economy
00:02:01.880 into the rest and everybody's got more
00:02:03.719 cash in their pocket and except for
00:02:06.039 meanwhile you know it's a terrible
00:02:08.318 situation for a percentage of the people
00:02:11.640 you know this suit I haven't worn a suit
00:02:14.239 you know for a year practically and that
00:02:16.319 means that the dry cleaner nurse just
00:02:18.440 went out of business I mean that
00:02:19.640 nobody's bringing in suits they get dry
00:02:21.360 clean and nobody's nobody's bringing in
00:02:23.080 white shirts uh the place where my wife
00:02:26.160 goes the small business person if you
00:02:28.440 didn't have take out and delivery
00:02:31.599 services for restaurants you got killed
00:02:34.560 on the other hand if you've got takeout
00:02:36.560 facilities you've done you know same
00:02:38.760 source stes of Dairy Queen are up a
00:02:40.760 whole lot they adapted and but it's it
00:02:43.879 is not a price sensitive economy right
00:02:46.879 now in the least and uh I don't know
00:02:49.280 exactly how one shows up in different
00:02:51.840 price indices but there's there's more
00:02:54.599 inflation going on than quite a bit more
00:02:56.920 inflation going on than people would
00:02:58.360 have anticipated just six months ago or
00:03:01.640 thereabouts yeah and there's one very
00:03:03.680 intelligent man who thinks it's
00:03:05.400 dangerous and that's just the start
00:03:08.200 inflation is going to affect you the U
00:03:10.519 it's certain we will have inflation over
00:03:14.040 time and we are following policies in
00:03:17.720 this country now to stimulate things
00:03:20.480 which stimulate business which are bound
00:03:23.640 to have some inflationary
00:03:26.000 consequences and to the extent that we
00:03:28.840 borrow money from the of the world it
00:03:31.480 would be very human on the part of of
00:03:34.120 politicians in the future decide that
00:03:36.000 they would rather pay the rest of the
00:03:37.879 world back in dollars that are worth far
00:03:40.200 less than the dollars they borrowed I
00:03:42.640 mean it's the classic way of
00:03:45.680 reducing the impact and cost of external
00:03:49.680 debt and we're building up a lot of
00:03:51.200 external debt I always find it
00:03:53.480 interesting when politicians now talk
00:03:56.200 about using the taxpayers money to do
00:03:58.280 this and the taxpayers money to do that
00:04:00.079 and how the taxpayers are paying the
00:04:01.560 bonuses at AIG we haven't raised taxes
00:04:04.319 at all in this country you know I mean
00:04:06.480 taxpayers are paying nothing beyond what
00:04:09.040 they were paying a couple years ago a
00:04:10.480 matter of fact the federal revenues this
00:04:13.159 year which were close to 2.6 trillion a
00:04:16.798 couple years ago you know maybe more
00:04:18.880 like 2.3 trillion so we are taking less
00:04:21.279 money from the taxpayers the people are
00:04:23.600 really paying for the things we're doing
00:04:25.840 now will probably be the people who are
00:04:29.120 buying dollar Investments much of it
00:04:32.000 from the US government and who will find
00:04:34.080 the purchasing power when they go to
00:04:36.280 redeem those Investments to be far less
00:04:38.320 so you can you might say that that the
00:04:40.840 AIG bonus is probably the
00:04:42.960 Chinese have are the people that are
00:04:45.759 ultimately paying the most in terms of
00:04:47.960 the loss of purchasing power they will
00:04:49.720 have with their with their Holdings of
00:04:52.080 government bonds US government bonds
00:04:54.400 many years down the road but it sounds
00:04:55.880 better to say the taxpayer than to say
00:04:57.520 the Chinese are paying Bo it's an
00:04:59.680 interesting situation I read that
00:05:02.039 comment every day about how the
00:05:03.000 taxpayers are doing this and that you I
00:05:05.080 haven't had my taxes raised you haven't
00:05:06.680 had your taxes raised they're giving me
00:05:08.479 250 bucks back here pretty soon uh yet
00:05:11.759 taxpayers haven't paid anything so far
00:05:13.759 and my guess is that the ultimate price
00:05:16.280 of much of this will be paid by a
00:05:18.120 shrinkage in the value of the real value
00:05:21.280 of fixed dollar Investments down the
00:05:22.960 road uh and that will be the easiest
00:05:25.039 thing to do and if it's the easiest
00:05:26.360 thing to do it's the most likely thing
00:05:27.720 to have happen so you we will see plenty
00:05:30.199 of inflation now the best protection
00:05:31.680 against inflation is your own earning
00:05:34.280 power if you're the best teacher if
00:05:36.319 you're the best surgeon if you're the
00:05:37.560 best lawyer you know whatever it may be
00:05:40.280 you will command a given part of other
00:05:43.319 people's production of goods and
00:05:44.759 services no matter what the currency is
00:05:47.120 whether it's seashells or right marks or
00:05:49.639 or dollars so your ear own earning power
00:05:53.120 is the best by far if you're the best
00:05:54.840 journalist whatever it may be you will
00:05:57.520 get your share of the national economic
00:06:00.440 Pi regardless of the value of whatever
00:06:04.319 the currency may be is measured against
00:06:06.199 some earlier standard the second best
00:06:08.759 protection is a wonderful business you
00:06:10.919 know if you if you own the Coca-Cola
00:06:14.560 trademark company you will get a given
00:06:17.880 portion of people's labor 20 years from
00:06:20.440 now and 50 years from now for your
00:06:22.800 product and it doesn't make any
00:06:23.960 difference what's happened to the price
00:06:25.720 level generally uh because people will
00:06:29.160 give up 3 minutes of Labor five whatever
00:06:31.400 it may be to enjoy you know a 12 ounces
00:06:35.639 of a you know of a product they like so
00:06:38.319 those are the great assets your own
00:06:39.759 earning power first and then the earning
00:06:41.479 power of a wonderful business that does
00:06:43.000 not require heavy capital investment
00:06:45.240 that requires heavy capital investment
00:06:46.840 you get killed in inflation and uh with
00:06:49.400 those guidelines I would tell you the
00:06:50.919 best thing to do is invest in
00:06:52.880 yourself yes the young man should become
00:06:55.680 a brain surgeon and invest in Coca-Cola
00:06:58.319 instead of Government Bond
00:07:02.199 if you discount it back and you're
00:07:04.240 discounting at present interest rates
00:07:06.199 stocks are very very cheap now the
00:07:08.039 question is what interest rates do over
00:07:09.800 time but there's a view of what interest
00:07:12.520 rates will be based in the yield curve
00:07:14.639 out to 30 years and you know so on it
00:07:17.759 it's a fascinating time we've never
00:07:19.160 really seen what shoveling money in on
00:07:23.599 the basis that we're doing it on a a
00:07:25.680 fiscal basis while following a monetary
00:07:27.440 policy of something close to zero
00:07:29.720 interest rates and it is enormously
00:07:32.560 pleasant but in economics there's one
00:07:34.960 thing always to remember you can you can
00:07:36.840 never do one thing you always have to
00:07:39.039 say and then what and we are sending out
00:07:43.840 huge sums I mean president said it on
00:07:47.919 Wednesday 85% of the people we're going
00:07:50.400 to get a $1,400 check you know uh
00:07:53.919 85% and a couple years ago we were
00:07:56.759 saying 40% of the people couldn't never
00:07:58.720 could come up with 4 $100 to cash so
00:08:00.720 we've got 85% of the people getting
00:08:04.199 those sums and so far we've had no
00:08:06.479 unpleasant consequences from it I mean
00:08:08.520 people feel better the people who get
00:08:10.360 the money feel better and people are
00:08:12.720 lending money don't feel very good but
00:08:15.039 it causes stocks to go up it causes
00:08:17.520 business to flourish it causes an
00:08:19.720 electorate to be happy and we'll see if
00:08:22.800 it causes anything else and if it
00:08:25.120 doesn't cause anything else you can
00:08:27.120 count on it continuing in a very big way
00:08:29.960 but you there there are consequences to
00:08:31.960 everything in economics but that is that
00:08:34.479 is why the Googles and the apples and we
00:08:38.880 don't own gole we don't own Microsoft we
00:08:40.799 don't but they are incredible companies
00:08:43.039 in terms of what they earn on Capital
00:08:45.680 they don't require a lot of capital and
00:08:47.560 they gush out more money and if you're
00:08:50.800 trying to find bonds that gush out more
00:08:54.080 more money from the federal government
00:08:55.680 we got 100 billion that's gushing out
00:08:58.440 like you know 30 or $40 million a year
00:09:01.440 or whatever it may be depending on the
00:09:02.760 short-term race it's so that puts the
00:09:05.120 pressure on which is exactly of course
00:09:06.839 what the monetary authorities want done
00:09:08.959 I mean that's they're they're pushing
00:09:11.640 the economy in a and they're doing in
00:09:13.720 Europe you know even more extreme and
00:09:16.200 they're pushing and we're aiding it with
00:09:18.360 fiscal policy and people feel good and
00:09:21.880 people have become numbed to numbers you
00:09:24.519 know trillions don't mean anything to
00:09:26.200 anybody you know uh and $1,400 does mean
00:09:29.600 something to him so we'll see where it
00:09:31.959 all leads but it's Charlie and I
00:09:33.959 consider it the most interesting movie
00:09:36.959 by far we've ever seen in terms of
00:09:38.600 economics don't really yes and the
00:09:40.880 professional economists of course have
00:09:43.120 been very surprised by what's happened
00:09:45.880 it reminds me of what Churchill said
00:09:48.000 about Clement adley he said he was a
00:09:49.839 very modest man and had a great deal to
00:09:52.000 be mo modest about and that's exactly
00:09:55.200 what's happened to the professional
00:09:57.079 Economist they were so confident about
00:09:59.519 everything and turns out the world is
00:10:01.839 more complicated than than they thought
00:10:04.680 Kan said it many years ago that it it's
00:10:07.120 it's an invisible tax that only one man
00:10:09.800 in a million really understands and it's
00:10:12.079 a tax on people that have had faith in
00:10:14.440 their currency uh that the government's
00:10:16.600 issued that the best protection the best
00:10:19.640 investment against inflation is to
00:10:21.320 improve your own earning power yeah your
00:10:23.560 own talents very few people maximize
00:10:25.839 their talents and if you incre increase
00:10:29.560 your talents they can't tax it while
00:10:31.760 you're doing it they they you know they
00:10:33.240 can't take it away from you so if you
00:10:35.600 become more useful in your activities
00:10:38.360 your profession you know doctor lawyer
00:10:40.720 whatever it may be that is the best
00:10:43.000 protection against a currency that might
00:10:46.600 decline at a rapid rate and and uh the
00:10:49.600 best investment passive investment I
00:10:52.320 think is a good business if you own an
00:10:55.800 interest in a good business you're very
00:10:58.720 likely to maintain purchasing power no
00:11:02.000 matter what happens to the currency but
00:11:04.240 uh it's interesting in the United States
00:11:07.279 the value of the dollar since I was born
00:11:10.040 has declined by 94% to 6 cents so
00:11:14.480 inflation is a very cruel tax on people
00:11:17.200 who believe in fixed dollars but things
00:11:19.360 can work out pretty well even during
00:11:21.360 inflationary times I mean if somebody
00:11:23.320 told me when I was born you know that
00:11:25.480 the dollar bill is going to go to six
00:11:26.959 cents I might have I might have said you
00:11:28.880 know let me go let me go back I'm not
00:11:32.320 I'm not interested in emerging into that
00:11:33.920 kind of a world but actually it's worked
00:11:35.440 out pretty well so I have no
00:11:37.760 complaints investing in yourself is the
00:11:40.120 best thing you can do anything that
00:11:41.320 improves your own talents nobody can
00:11:42.800 take it away from you they can run up
00:11:44.600 huge deficits and the dollar can become
00:11:46.440 worth far less you can have all kinds of
00:11:48.720 things happen but if you've got talents
00:11:50.320 yourself and you've maximized your
00:11:52.279 talent you've got a terrific asset and
00:11:54.480 that doesn't mean everybody should go to
00:11:55.560 college but it does mean that any way
00:11:57.600 you find to improve communication skills
00:12:00.200 are enormously important I mean I took
00:12:01.680 the Dale Carnegie course that I paid
00:12:03.120 $100 for and it was worth a college
00:12:05.040 degree I advise students as much as
00:12:08.000 possible look for the job that you would
00:12:10.240 take if you didn't need a job don't
00:12:12.200 sleep walk through life and don't say
00:12:13.920 it's all going to be great you know I'll
00:12:15.880 do this and I'll do that and I'm just
00:12:17.600 marking time to get to be older you
00:12:19.480 really want to be doing what you love
00:12:21.760 doing and you can't necessarily find it
00:12:23.760 on your first job but don't give up
00:12:25.800 before you find it you're going to make
00:12:27.279 mistakes in life I mean there's no
00:12:29.320 question about it you don't want to make
00:12:30.320 them on the big decisions you know who
00:12:31.639 you marry and things like that so
00:12:32.920 there's no way I'm going to make a lot
00:12:34.360 of business and investment decisions
00:12:36.199 without making some mistakes I may try
00:12:37.680 to minimize them I don't dwell on them
00:12:39.959 at all I don't look back the biggest
00:12:42.360 mistakes are the ones that actually
00:12:44.440 don't show up they're the mistakes of
00:12:46.240 omission rather than commission we've
00:12:47.880 never lost that much money on any one
00:12:50.639 investment uh but it's the things that I
00:12:52.639 knew enough to do that I didn't do we
00:12:54.399 have missed profits of as much as you
00:12:57.240 know maybe 10 billion doll in things
00:12:59.880 that I knew enough to do and I didn't do
00:13:01.720 now the fact I didn't buy Microsoft way
00:13:04.199 back is not a foregone opportunity
00:13:06.519 because I didn't know enough to make
00:13:07.600 that decision but there have been other
00:13:09.639 Investments where I didn't know enough
00:13:11.240 to make the decision and for one reason
00:13:13.160 or another I either didn't do it at all
00:13:15.160 or I did it on a small scale I was
00:13:16.800 sucking my thumb when I should have been
00:13:18.079 writing checks you know basically and
00:13:20.320 you know those don't show up there's no
00:13:21.880 place where it shows missed
00:13:23.279 opportunities but I've missed some big
00:13:24.720 ones the triumphs in life are partly
00:13:27.720 triumphs because you know that
00:13:28.800 everything isn't going to be a Triumph
00:13:30.399 and uh I would never get too hung up on
00:13:33.079 mistakes I know a lot of people that
00:13:34.360 really agonize over them and it just
00:13:36.040 isn't worth it I mean tomorrow is
00:13:37.399 another day and you live it forward and
00:13:38.959 just go on to the next thing the nature
00:13:40.959 of what I do means I have to think
00:13:43.600 pretty much independently because if I
00:13:45.560 take a poll in effect I'm going to do
00:13:47.880 what everybody else is doing and I don't
00:13:49.399 think much of that usually in
00:13:50.519 Investments and so I have to have an
00:13:52.720 environment and I have to have a
00:13:54.320 temperament personally that lets me
00:13:56.399 think for myself and I've got a terrific
00:14:00.000 partner fellow named Charlie moner you
00:14:02.639 can't find anybody any smarter any
00:14:04.440 better quality of anything but we think
00:14:06.440 a lot alike and we do talk things over
00:14:08.720 occasionally but we don't talk them over
00:14:10.160 very often because I know how he thinks
00:14:12.480 he knows how I thinks he's taught me a
00:14:13.959 lot you know and why should I pay for a
00:14:15.480 phone call if I know what he's going to
00:14:17.120 say so if I need to get a cabinet around
00:14:20.240 to make decisions or anything like that
00:14:22.320 I probably shouldn't be running the
00:14:23.639 place and that doesn't bother me to have
00:14:25.560 the responsibility for but I just don't
00:14:27.160 want to put it up to a vote cuz I've
00:14:28.560 seen too many particularly in the
00:14:30.120 investment world as you get larger and
00:14:32.160 larger groups making the decisions they
00:14:33.600 get more and more homogenized and I
00:14:35.759 don't think you will ever get brilliant
00:14:38.240 investment decisions out of a large
00:14:39.800 committee I always look at IQ and talent
00:14:42.320 of sort of representing the uh the
00:14:44.639 horsepower of the motor but then in
00:14:46.720 terms of the output the efficiency which
00:14:48.880 which the motor works that depends on
00:14:50.880 rationality because a lot of people
00:14:52.320 start out with 400 horsepower motors and
00:14:54.480 get 100 horsepower of output and it's
00:14:57.040 way better to have a 200 horsepower
00:14:58.519 motor and get a at all in output and and
00:15:00.600 so why do smart people do things that
00:15:02.800 interfere with really getting the output
00:15:04.800 they're entitled to and it gets into the
00:15:07.199 habits and the character and the
00:15:08.440 temperament and it really gets into
00:15:10.040 behaving in a rational manner it's not
00:15:11.880 getting in your own way as I say
00:15:13.880 everybody here has the ability
00:15:16.040 absolutely to do anything I do and much
00:15:18.000 Beyond and some of you will and some of
00:15:20.040 you won't the ones that won't it will be
00:15:22.360 because uh you get in your own way it
00:15:24.000 won't be because the world doesn't allow
00:15:25.360 you to it will be because you don't
00:15:27.279 allow yourself to you want to associate
00:15:30.319 with people who are the kind of person
00:15:31.800 you'd like to be you'll move in that
00:15:33.560 direction and the most important person
00:15:35.639 by far in that respect as your spouse I
00:15:37.920 can't overemphasize how important that
00:15:39.399 is and you're right the friends you have
00:15:41.880 they will form you as you go through
00:15:44.000 life and make some good friends keep
00:15:46.440 them for the rest of your life but have
00:15:48.240 them be people that you admire as well
00:15:51.040 as like them I have an old fashion
00:15:53.360 belief that I can only should expect to
00:15:55.920 make money in things that I understand
00:15:57.600 and when I say understand I don't mean
00:16:00.040 understand you know what the product
00:16:01.600 does or anything like that I mean
00:16:03.720 understand what the economics of the
00:16:05.319 business are likely to look like 10
00:16:07.360 years from now or 20 years from now I
00:16:09.560 know in general what the economics will
00:16:12.240 say wrigly chewing gum will look like 10
00:16:14.399 years from now the Internet isn't going
00:16:16.079 to change the way people chew gum it
00:16:18.600 isn't going to change which gum they
00:16:20.160 chew you know if you own the chewing gum
00:16:22.959 Market in a big way and you've got
00:16:25.440 double Min spearmint and Juicy Fruit
00:16:27.880 those Brands will be there 10 years from
00:16:30.000 now so I can't pinpoint exactly what the
00:16:33.160 numbers are going to look like on rley
00:16:34.480 but I'm not going to be way off if I try
00:16:36.120 to look forward on something like that
00:16:38.319 evaluating that company is within what I
00:16:40.360 call my circle of competence I
00:16:42.240 understand what they do I understand the
00:16:44.199 economics of and I understand the
00:16:45.639 competitive aspects of the business so
00:16:48.519 figuring out the economic consequences
00:16:51.399 TV I think there's I don't know 20 25
00:16:53.920 million cents a year sold in the United
00:16:55.519 States I don't think there's one of them
00:16:56.720 made in the United States anymore I mean
00:16:58.880 You' say TV set manufacturer what a
00:17:00.519 wonderful business everybody now nobody
00:17:02.519 had a TV in 1950 everybody has multiple
00:17:05.280 sets now nobody is in the United States
00:17:07.400 has made any real money making the sets
00:17:09.319 that they're all out of business you
00:17:10.480 know the Magna boxes the rcas all of
00:17:12.919 those companies radio was the equivalent
00:17:15.119 in the 20 over 500 companies making
00:17:16.959 radios in the 1920s again I don't think
00:17:19.199 there's a US radio manufacturer at the
00:17:21.079 present time but Coca-Cola you know what
00:17:24.319 was it 1884 Jacob's Pharmacy or whatever
00:17:26.839 the fellow comes up with something of
00:17:29.080 copers over the years but now you've got
00:17:31.559 a company that is selling roughly 1.1
00:17:35.120 billion 8 ounce servings of its product
00:17:37.520 not all Coke Sprite and some others
00:17:39.640 daily throughout the world 117 years
00:17:42.600 later so understanding the economic
00:17:45.280 characteristics of a business is
00:17:47.280 different than predicting the fact that
00:17:49.120 an industry is going to do wonderfully
00:17:51.360 so when I look at the internet
00:17:53.840 businesses or I look at Tech businesses
00:17:55.880 I say this is a marvelous thing and I
00:17:57.480 love to play around on the computer and
00:17:59.400 now I order my books from Amazon and all
00:18:01.240 kinds of things but I don't know who's
00:18:02.880 going to win and unless I know who's
00:18:04.720 going to win I'm not interested in
00:18:06.440 investing I'll just play around on the
00:18:07.799 computer and uh defining your circle of
00:18:10.640 competence is the most important aspect
00:18:13.320 of investing it's not how large your
00:18:15.919 circle is you don't have to be an expert
00:18:18.240 on everything but knowing where the
00:18:20.520 perimeter of that Circle of what you
00:18:22.120 know and what you don't know is and
00:18:23.799 staying inside of it is all important
00:18:26.520 Tom Watson senior who started IBM said
00:18:29.520 in his book he said I'm no genius but
00:18:32.159 I'm smart in spots and I stay around
00:18:34.120 those spots and you know that is the key
00:18:36.960 uh so if I understand a few things and I
00:18:39.919 stick in that Arena I'll do okay and if
00:18:43.240 I don't understand something but I get
00:18:44.440 all excited about it because my
00:18:45.520 neighbors are talking about stocks are
00:18:46.840 going up and everything I start fooling
00:18:48.600 around someplace else eventually I'll
00:18:50.120 get cream and I should uh I met Bob
00:18:52.600 Woodward and he'd just come out with All
00:18:54.320 the President's Men and all of a sudden
00:18:56.240 as at below 30 years of age he was
00:18:58.000 getting quite well we had the breakfast
00:18:59.960 or lunch over at the Madison Hotel they
00:19:02.120 said what do I do with this money and I
00:19:03.640 said investing is just about assigning
00:19:05.840 yourself the right story I said imagine
00:19:07.720 Ben Bradley this morning said to you
00:19:09.679 what is the Washington Post company wor
00:19:11.720 what would you do if you have to write
00:19:12.919 the story in a month you'd go out and
00:19:14.600 interview TV Brokers and newspaper
00:19:16.640 Brokers and owners and you try and value
00:19:18.880 each asset I said that's what I do I
00:19:20.960 assign myself the right story and it's
00:19:23.360 nothing more than that now there's some
00:19:24.760 stories I can't write if you ask me to
00:19:26.679 write a story on you know what is some
00:19:28.799 glamorous but nonprofit making business
00:19:30.880 worth I don't know how to write that
00:19:32.520 story but if you ask me to write a story
00:19:34.200 on what is pic electric power Worth or
00:19:36.559 something like that I can write the
00:19:38.120 story and that's what I'm doing every
00:19:39.480 day it's been my painting for 50 some
00:19:41.880 years I get to paint what I want I don't
00:19:43.600 have to follow what Wall Street is
00:19:45.080 telling me to do next quarter or
00:19:46.400 something so I own the brush I own the
00:19:48.679 canvas and the canvas is unlimited now
00:19:50.840 that's a pretty nice game and I get to
00:19:52.280 do it every day with people I like I
00:19:55.039 don't have to associate with anyone that
00:19:57.320 causes my stomach to turn you know I've
00:19:59.960 said many times that if you get to be 65
00:20:03.360 or 70 and later and the people that you
00:20:06.360 want to have love you actually do love
00:20:08.080 you you're a success I've never seen
00:20:09.960 anybody that reaches that age I mean I'm
00:20:12.520 not talking about somebody that's in
00:20:13.840 extreme poverty or pain or something but
00:20:15.880 never seen anybody that if they have a
00:20:17.520 lot of people that love them that is
00:20:19.720 other than happy and I've seen some very
00:20:21.679 very wealthy people that now at 86 I
00:20:25.159 mean I've seen a lot of people that have
00:20:26.840 gotten older and I've never seen anybody
00:20:28.840 that is 70E pi and age who felt good
00:20:31.559 about their children that felt bad about
00:20:33.480 their life in all my experience I've
00:20:35.360 seen plenty of people with lots of money
00:20:37.280 that where it hasn't worked out well in
00:20:38.840 the family and they didn't feel good
00:20:40.120 about their children and well or the
00:20:41.760 children didn't feel good about them you
00:20:43.600 I mean But whichever way I mean but
00:20:45.799 there was they failed at the most
00:20:47.760 important teaching job they had in
00:20:49.559 personal relationship and sometimes it
00:20:51.559 happens for extraneous reasons but I
00:20:54.000 really have never met anybody regardless
00:20:56.360 of their economic circumstances who felt
00:20:58.679 their life was a failure and I knew one
00:21:00.679 fellow was extraordinarily Rich he put a
00:21:03.000 lot of money in his kids' name he didn't
00:21:04.600 want them to have any control over it
00:21:05.840 once a year he would have dinner with
00:21:07.080 them and try and get them to sign their
00:21:08.360 income tax return in blank now just
00:21:10.600 imagine that you know with this case
00:21:12.520 four kids none of them he wanted to have
00:21:15.159 enough confidence in them or to have
00:21:17.120 it's just crazy I mean he would rule
00:21:18.840 them during this dinner and they knew
00:21:20.080 exactly what was going on once a year
00:21:22.159 you know and then he'd bribe them sort
00:21:23.480 of to sign their income tax return in
00:21:25.200 blank so he could file and they wouldn't
00:21:26.559 know what they had I've seen just time
00:21:28.600 after time when people have been success
00:21:30.480 I've seen plenty of the other too but
00:21:31.840 success is a business and failure and I
00:21:34.200 don't think they feel that good about
00:21:35.559 life the whole long-term Capital
00:21:37.400 Management and I hope most of you are
00:21:38.919 familiar with it but the whole story is
00:21:40.600 really fascinating because if you take
00:21:43.120 John Merryweather and Eric Rosenfeld
00:21:45.840 Larry Helen brand Greg Hawkins Victor
00:21:48.520 agani the two Nobel Prize winners meron
00:21:51.279 scholes if you take the 16 of them they
00:21:53.880 probably have as high an average IQ as
00:21:55.679 any 16 people working together in one
00:21:57.559 business in the country including at
00:21:59.039 Microsoft or wherever you want to name
00:22:00.919 so there incredible amount of intellect
00:22:03.240 in that room now you combine that with
00:22:05.559 the fact that those 16 had had extensive
00:22:08.919 experience in the field they were
00:22:10.000 operating I mean this was not a bunch of
00:22:11.440 guys who had made their money you know
00:22:12.840 selling men's clothing and then all of a
00:22:14.360 sudden went into the Securities business
00:22:15.640 or anything they had had in aggregate
00:22:17.039 the 16 had probably had 350 or 400 years
00:22:19.679 of experience doing exactly what they
00:22:21.440 were doing and then you throw in the
00:22:23.080 third factor that most of them had
00:22:25.279 virtually all of their very substantial
00:22:27.240 net worths in the business so they they
00:22:28.600 had their own money up hundreds and
00:22:30.400 hundreds of millions of dollars of their
00:22:31.760 own money up super high intellect
00:22:33.480 working in a field they knew and
00:22:35.000 essentially they went broke and that to
00:22:37.200 me is absolutely fascinating I mean if I
00:22:39.039 ever write a book it's going to be
00:22:40.120 called why smart people do dumb things
00:22:42.960 my partner says it should be
00:22:44.080 autobiographical but I but this might be
00:22:47.480 an interesting illustration and these
00:22:48.679 are perfectly decent guys I respect them
00:22:50.520 and they helped me out when I had
00:22:51.640 problems with Solomon and they're not
00:22:53.320 bad people at all but to make money they
00:22:56.200 didn't have and didn't need they risked
00:22:58.640 what they did have and did need and
00:23:00.559 that's foolish that is just plain
00:23:01.960 foolish doesn't make any what your IQ is
00:23:03.960 if you risk something that is important
00:23:05.559 to you for something that is unimportant
00:23:07.880 to you it just does not make any sense I
00:23:10.240 don't care whether the odds are 100 to
00:23:11.679 one that you succeed or a thousand to
00:23:13.039 one that you succeed if you hand me a
00:23:15.000 gun with a thousand Chambers a million
00:23:17.559 Chambers in it and there's a bullet in
00:23:18.919 one chamber and you said put it up your
00:23:20.279 temple how much do you want to be paid
00:23:22.080 to pull it once I'm not going to pull it
00:23:23.919 you know you can name any Su you want
00:23:25.520 but it doesn't do anything for me on the
00:23:27.720 upside and I think the downside is
00:23:29.520 fairly clear so I'm not interested in
00:23:32.600 that kind of a game and yet people do it
00:23:34.640 financially then without thinking about
00:23:36.320 it very much one thing I will tell you
00:23:38.679 that I didn't realize when I was getting
00:23:40.559 out of school is how much the unusual
00:23:43.120 person will jump out at you and it isn't
00:23:45.760 because they got 200 IQs or anything
00:23:47.640 like that it's really because just how
00:23:49.440 they behave you know what they bring the
00:23:51.480 energy they bring the commitment they
00:23:53.120 bring the quality of how they do things
00:23:55.520 how they treat the people around them
00:23:56.960 all kinds of things but you will jump
00:23:58.960 out much more than you might anticipate
00:24:01.440 one of the things you would want to be
00:24:03.159 sure to do is whether you like it or not
00:24:06.679 get very comfortable it may take a while
00:24:09.080 with public speaking for example I mean
00:24:10.880 that's an asset that will last you 50 or
00:24:13.640 60 years and it's a liability if you
00:24:16.039 don't like doing it or uncomfortable
00:24:17.640 doing it that also will last you 50 or
00:24:19.600 60 years and it's a necessary skill but
00:24:22.120 a lot of the skills are just human
00:24:23.520 skills if you get the best out of people
00:24:25.440 around you that's a rare talent and it
00:24:27.799 doesn't Cor with IQ it correlates with
00:24:29.840 an attitude toward the world and toward
00:24:31.440 other people and it's a talent that if
00:24:33.440 you work at early and you're really
00:24:35.399 conscious about it you know you don't
00:24:36.760 have to show up other people you know
00:24:38.120 you don't have to be smarter than they
00:24:39.039 are or anything else you want to bring
00:24:40.039 out the best in them it will pay huge
00:24:42.480 dividends
