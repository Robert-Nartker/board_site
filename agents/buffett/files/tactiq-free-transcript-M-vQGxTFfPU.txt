00:00:17.560 testing 1 million 2 million three
00:00:20.320 million well you can always hear that
00:00:22.600 anyway uh uh you know when I came down
00:00:26.080 today it's been it's been 50 uh 54 years
00:00:29.679 since I drove down uh what was in the
00:00:32.279 highway six the Corn Husker highway to
00:00:34.600 uh come to Lincoln to
00:00:36.600 school and even then there was a lot of
00:00:39.160 nostalgia attached with it because my
00:00:41.719 father had uh uh attended the University
00:00:45.320 of Nebraska in the
00:00:46.800 1920s uh he was editor of the daily
00:00:49.079 Nebraskan and one day a a young woman
00:00:54.039 from West Point uh student came in to
00:00:58.160 apply for a job as a repor repor on The
00:01:00.399 Daily Nebraskan and uh and uh my father
00:01:04.720 not only hired her as a reporter but he
00:01:07.119 married her shortly thereafter so both
00:01:09.640 my parents attended here my
00:01:13.159 grandfather on my mother's side was here
00:01:15.400 in the in the 1890s and uh uh so a lot
00:01:19.280 of good things have happened to me
00:01:20.400 because of the University of Nebraska I
00:01:22.079 I received a terrific education here uh
00:01:24.880 I was telling the
00:01:26.159 dean uh the most valuable thing I
00:01:29.479 learned here but I learned a lot but the
00:01:31.400 most valuable was was uh accounting and
00:01:34.119 we had a wonderful Professor named Ray
00:01:36.280 Dean uh there may even be something
00:01:38.600 named for him down here isn't it yeah I
00:01:40.880 mean he was uh I'd been to the Wharton
00:01:43.119 School I went to Columbia Graduate
00:01:44.920 School uh subsequently but and I took a
00:01:47.719 lot of accounting courses but by far the
00:01:50.280 best instruction I received in
00:01:52.079 accounting came from raiding and and uh
00:01:56.159 there's nothing more important I people
00:01:59.240 ask me what they you take in business
00:02:00.680 school and and and uh uh or even if they
00:02:03.759 don't go to business school what they
00:02:04.960 need to know before getting in business
00:02:06.479 and I tell them you know you have to you
00:02:08.919 have to understand accounting it's the
00:02:10.440 language I mean it would be it's like
00:02:12.680 being in a foreign country without
00:02:14.680 knowing the language if you're in
00:02:15.959 business and you don't understand
00:02:17.160 accounting so it it it you you want to
00:02:19.879 get as comfortable with that uh as you
00:02:22.720 are with the English language it it it's
00:02:25.879 made me uh uh a lot of money because I I
00:02:29.920 I listen to what Ray Dean had to say 53
00:02:32.760 or 4 years ago and I've been able to
00:02:36.040 understand uh what I was seeing on
00:02:40.200 pieces of paper what that told me about
00:02:42.239 businesses and the limitations of what
00:02:44.000 it told me about businesses I mean but
00:02:46.239 that's the way we invest uh yesterday I
00:02:49.480 was in Knoxville
00:02:50.879 Tennessee and we bought a company we
00:02:54.319 agreed to buy a company called Clayton
00:02:56.120 Holmes about a week ago it's a big
00:02:59.159 company in the manufactured home
00:03:00.640 business so we agreed to pay $1.7
00:03:03.239 billion for
00:03:04.840 it I made that deal over the phone
00:03:07.280 without ever meeting the people there
00:03:09.680 but I had seen enough through Reading
00:03:13.239 10ks 10 Q's annual reports but looking
00:03:16.200 at figures what they tell me in terms of
00:03:19.400 the kind of people even running the
00:03:20.920 place the kind of accounting decisions
00:03:22.599 they make and so on I was able to make
00:03:24.640 that $1.7 billion transactions over the
00:03:27.760 phone yesterday was the first time I met
00:03:29.439 the people people and their board of
00:03:31.360 directors that actually approved the
00:03:32.599 deal a a week earlier uh so it's uh you
00:03:36.519 know I couldn't have done that if I
00:03:38.360 hadn't have uh you know had a great time
00:03:41.400 at rayan's class 53 years ago so if I'm
00:03:44.599 if I'm going to tout one thing aside
00:03:46.400 from this particular leadership class of
00:03:48.239 course uh if I'm going to tell one thing
00:03:51.080 uh I I would I would I would tell you
00:03:53.159 that uh get comfortable with it you know
00:03:56.319 it it uh it may not happen the first
00:03:58.360 week or the first month in the class but
00:04:00.640 but get very comfortable with accounting
00:04:02.319 so that I run into CEOs
00:04:05.400 periodically uh who really don't
00:04:07.439 understand it you know they try to Bluff
00:04:08.920 their way through and uh you can just
00:04:12.000 see you can see in their faces they're
00:04:13.280 frightened almost one day somebody hands
00:04:14.879 them a balance sheet or an income
00:04:16.519 statement they really don't know what it
00:04:17.680 means and they have to count on somebody
00:04:19.040 else and that's something you shouldn't
00:04:21.238 count on we make all our acquisition
00:04:23.040 decisions ourselves I mean we don't call
00:04:24.919 in Consultants or anybody we don't call
00:04:27.080 in investment bankers much to their
00:04:28.720 discust uh no Investment Banking fees in
00:04:31.560 the Clayton Homes deal uh because you
00:04:35.280 know it's my responsibility running
00:04:37.199 Berkshire to understand enough about our
00:04:39.600 acquisition decisions uh to make them uh
00:04:43.400 based on the numbers that I see and and
00:04:45.400 and what I see there uh this course
00:04:47.840 however is about leadership and I like
00:04:50.520 to talk just for a minute about that and
00:04:53.199 then I'd like to really talk about
00:04:54.840 whatever is on your mind and I we'll get
00:04:56.880 questions but you know leadership
00:04:58.840 obviously it's a very it's a very simple
00:05:01.320 thing in concept uh uh my job as the
00:05:05.039 leader of Burkshire
00:05:06.440 halfway is to have visions and and goals
00:05:12.600 for the company overall with a long time
00:05:16.080 arism attached to
00:05:17.880 them and then to get those goals
00:05:21.280 accomplished through other people that's
00:05:23.360 what that's what it's all about I can't
00:05:24.520 do it myself so I have to I have to I
00:05:26.880 have to know where I want us to get to I
00:05:29.360 have to see over the next Mountain if
00:05:31.440 possible but then I have to get a lot of
00:05:33.440 other people to look over that mountain
00:05:36.440 with me and really do the job I mean
00:05:38.759 they are the ones that get it
00:05:39.639 accomplished so it's it's getting things
00:05:41.039 done through other people now Berkshire
00:05:43.800 is like some like many large
00:05:47.639 corporations in certain ways but it's
00:05:49.120 really quite different in many ways
00:05:51.680 uh we have over 150,000 people now
00:05:56.000 working for birkshire Hathaway in dozens
00:05:58.120 of companies uh throughout this country
00:06:01.039 primarily and even abroad a little bit
00:06:03.400 we have exactly 15.8 people in
00:06:06.440 headquarters and Deb Ray came down with
00:06:08.720 me today so we've only got 13.8 uh there
00:06:11.919 today and we're probably working just as
00:06:13.400 well with those 13.8 as we would if Deb
00:06:15.280 and I were in the office but uh that is
00:06:18.160 a that's an unusual organization I mean
00:06:20.880 we we have dozens of operating managers
00:06:24.440 CEOs of their businesses out there
00:06:26.919 running them today and they do it
00:06:29.080 without any direction from the home
00:06:31.319 office except for one very limited piece
00:06:33.400 of direction that I give them which I'll
00:06:35.639 get to in a second but we have these
00:06:37.840 people and they're an unusual group of
00:06:39.520 people running these businesses because
00:06:41.720 most of them have sold their businesses
00:06:43.400 to us and they're very very wealthy
00:06:46.440 three4 of our managers do not need to
00:06:49.720 work financially they have no reason
00:06:51.840 financially to work probably 3/4 of them
00:06:54.319 are worth at least $50 million and and
00:06:58.080 and we have some that are worth in the
00:06:59.360 bill millions and yet these people jump
00:07:01.400 out of bed every morning you know and
00:07:03.759 and work and they work weekends and they
00:07:05.440 love working and why is that what's the
00:07:07.960 key to that
00:07:10.199 well the key really is the same reason I
00:07:13.960 keep working you know I'm 72 I'm getting
00:07:16.680 Social Security now so I you know I I I
00:07:19.919 should be in Florida you know pushing
00:07:22.080 shuffle board around or something of the
00:07:23.479 sort but but but I do what I can do
00:07:26.479 anything in the world I want to do but
00:07:27.960 what I want to do is run Burkshire
00:07:29.199 halfway now why do I want to run it that
00:07:30.840 point there's a couple things you know a
00:07:34.080 I get to paint my own painting I go down
00:07:36.840 there every day and I feel like you know
00:07:38.919 I feel like Michelangelo there you know
00:07:40.680 working on the sine Chapel or something
00:07:42.599 nobody else may think it's a great
00:07:43.840 painting but I get to paint my own
00:07:45.159 painting I do not have people second
00:07:46.919 guessing me I do not have being people
00:07:49.280 saying why don't you use a little more
00:07:50.639 red paint than blue paint why don't you
00:07:52.199 paint a Seascape instead of a landscape
00:07:54.319 I get to do my own thing I get to it's
00:07:57.000 it's it's a form of creativity it's it's
00:08:00.319 exactly like somebody feels it's a
00:08:02.759 professional golfer or somebody feels
00:08:04.319 it's a painter they're not doing it for
00:08:06.280 the money primarily uh they're doing it
00:08:09.240 because they like doing something well
00:08:10.960 and that they it happens to go be down
00:08:13.000 the down the uh route of their talents
00:08:16.680 and the second thing I like frankly is I
00:08:18.520 like I like applause I like appreciation
00:08:21.599 so I like having
00:08:23.080 shareholders who feel good about what
00:08:25.639 I've done I mean it's you know I have I
00:08:27.879 have a 96-year-old
00:08:30.240 Aunt uh and uh her husband went the
00:08:33.599 iners Nebraska too and she is uh you
00:08:37.240 know she she has all her money in
00:08:38.679 birkshire halfway and she counts on me
00:08:40.799 and she's out in in Palm Springs now and
00:08:43.880 and her whole net worth is in birkshire
00:08:46.120 and I've got cousins and I got everybody
00:08:48.480 in our family has got all their money in
00:08:49.920 berer and so those people are counting
00:08:52.160 on me and that's kind of fun to have
00:08:54.880 something where you can actually deliver
00:08:56.680 for other people and change their lives
00:08:59.079 and positive ways as a matter of fact we
00:09:01.640 had a couple that nobody had ever heard
00:09:04.079 of up until a few years ago the ammers
00:09:07.600 in in New York they came from Omaha Don
00:09:10.079 Ur went to Central High m Ur uh uh uh
00:09:14.240 not sure which high school she went to
00:09:15.680 an probably South High they left $750
00:09:19.279 million when they died nobody ever heard
00:09:21.480 of them and I think a substantial
00:09:23.519 portion yeah went right here to the
00:09:25.720 University of Nebraska it was probably a
00:09:27.560 total surprise to the university
00:09:29.920 uh when they got I don't know you
00:09:31.959 probably got 150 million or so did yeah
00:09:34.440 thank you yeah well you should thank the
00:09:36.399 offers but nevertheless I you know you
00:09:39.000 see the money you see good things
00:09:40.760 happening out of it so it's fun I mean
00:09:43.040 it's uh you know it beats it beats
00:09:45.480 playing golf every day or something of
00:09:47.040 the sort so I say if that's what turns
00:09:49.079 me on what's going to turn on these
00:09:51.160 managers that are out there running
00:09:52.760 things like Clayton Holmes or or we've
00:09:55.240 got a company flight safety that trains
00:09:57.360 more pilots than anybody in the world
00:09:59.720 flight safety is run by an 85y old man
00:10:03.360 Al Yuli Al started the company with
00:10:06.560 $10,000 in
00:10:08.360 1951 it now trains four or five times as
00:10:11.240 many Pilots as non-military Pilots as
00:10:14.839 any as anybody in the world and he is
00:10:18.000 there at 855 and it's a matter public
00:10:20.680 record he's got a billion dollars worth
00:10:22.240 of birkshire shares he works seven days
00:10:24.440 a week he loves it and he loves it for
00:10:26.519 the same reason that I love what I do he
00:10:28.800 gets to do do it his way he buys these
00:10:31.240 big simulators that you train pilots in
00:10:33.680 he doesn't have to check with me as to
00:10:35.160 whether to spend $15 million for a
00:10:37.000 simulator he doesn't ask me he knows so
00:10:39.320 much more about it than than you know
00:10:40.720 than I do why in the world would he ask
00:10:42.600 me well I can't tell what kind of a
00:10:44.200 plane I'm in you know when I'm flying
00:10:45.600 around and and Al is spending a couple
00:10:48.120 hundred million dollars a year on
00:10:50.160 simulators uh she's spending birkshire
00:10:52.200 halfway money and he never checks with
00:10:54.360 Omaha he's never had to come to Omaha uh
00:10:57.040 for any kind of meetings he runs his own
00:10:59.440 business and that's what he loves in
00:11:01.440 life and I let him do it I mean that's
00:11:04.040 my contribution to it is is really
00:11:06.760 turning lose his energies and you know
00:11:09.839 they were properly directed before we
00:11:11.399 bought the company seven or eight years
00:11:12.760 ago why why should I think that you know
00:11:14.440 he couldn't keep running it after that
00:11:15.760 and like I say at 85 he's still running
00:11:17.680 it um the second thing that our managers
00:11:20.639 like in addition to this painting their
00:11:22.720 own painting is is they too love
00:11:26.200 Applause I mean I I try to be I I report
00:11:30.440 in my annual report accurately what they
00:11:32.560 have accomplished but they accomplished
00:11:34.000 a lot you heard Susan jock I think uh
00:11:37.399 some weeks ago here Susan came to
00:11:40.680 bores and she was making $4 an hour $4
00:11:44.399 an hour and at age before she was 40 she
00:11:48.639 became
00:11:49.600 CEO of the second largest independent
00:11:52.680 jewelry operation in the United States
00:11:54.639 you know from four bucks an hour but
00:11:56.639 it's Talent you know and and Susan knows
00:11:59.600 more about I don't know about jewelry
00:12:01.079 you know uh uh you could hand me a a
00:12:03.680 phony diamond or a real diamond I
00:12:05.200 couldn't tell the difference but if I
00:12:06.880 started telling Susan what to order in
00:12:09.639 the way of jewelry or if I started
00:12:11.200 telling her what kind of terms to extend
00:12:12.839 to customers or who to hire or anything
00:12:14.639 like that you know she doesn't need that
00:12:16.399 in life she really owns borines you know
00:12:19.480 we have the stock certificate we get the
00:12:22.199 profits get a custom to uh but it's her
00:12:26.800 baby it's her baby she decides you know
00:12:30.040 everything about that place and and so
00:12:32.800 it's her creation and that feeling of
00:12:36.360 ownership is really extraordinary and
00:12:38.560 it's so much better I mean it's the way
00:12:40.240 I like to work uh and it's the way you
00:12:42.720 know it's the way uh Susan Jack likes to
00:12:45.000 work it's the way Al Yoshi likes to work
00:12:46.920 and Susan like anybody else in this
00:12:49.560 world loves being appreciated I mean she
00:12:51.560 there'd be something wrong with her if
00:12:52.600 she didn't and the truth is nobody
00:12:54.680 appreciates her more than I do I mean
00:12:56.600 she is a talent and we are lucky to have
00:13:00.639 her and we're lucky to have all of these
00:13:02.639 other managers so leadership at at
00:13:05.720 birkshire really
00:13:07.800 consists of taking a bunch of people who
00:13:11.600 WI a baseball uh analogy would be 400
00:13:15.279 hitters and just handing them the bat
00:13:17.720 and just telling them to get up their
00:13:18.800 plate and take a big swing uh uh there's
00:13:21.480 very little to it beyond that one thing
00:13:23.600 I do is I send them a letter we don't
00:13:26.360 have meetings in Omaha some of our
00:13:27.880 managers
00:13:29.639 you know that there there aren't any
00:13:31.160 meetings and there no there's no
00:13:33.360 catechism or anything else once every
00:13:35.720 two years I send them a letter this is
00:13:37.240 it one and a roughly one and a one and a
00:13:40.800 half pages or so the only the only
00:13:43.160 instruction they get from us they don't
00:13:44.639 they don't send budgets to us we don't
00:13:46.320 we don't care about those some of the
00:13:47.519 companies use budgets some don't use
00:13:49.120 budgets we adjust to them some of the
00:13:51.519 managers I talked to a couple times a
00:13:53.279 week because they like to talk
00:13:54.440 frequently some of them I talk to
00:13:56.160 literally once a year because they don't
00:13:57.759 like to talk to me and whatever you know
00:14:00.279 it's up to them I I I adapt to them the
00:14:03.120 only thing I tell them and this letter
00:14:05.720 which went out January 20th 2003 it says
00:14:08.199 it's been two and a half years since my
00:14:09.800 last memo now how many big companies you
00:14:13.160 have the managers out there been two and
00:14:14.680 a half years since they heard from the
00:14:15.880 home office it's been two and a half
00:14:17.519 years since my last memo here are a
00:14:20.560 couple things to keep in
00:14:22.240 mind and number one and this is number
00:14:25.600 one every time this doesn't change it
00:14:27.399 won't change two years from now or four
00:14:28.880 years years from now or six years now
00:14:30.759 number one we can afford to lose money
00:14:33.440 even a lot of money we cannot afford to
00:14:36.199 lose reputation even a shred of
00:14:38.839 reputation let's be sure that everything
00:14:41.040 we do in business can be be reported on
00:14:43.480 the front page of a national newspaper
00:14:46.120 in an article written by an unfriendly
00:14:48.199 but intelligent reporter in many areas
00:14:51.199 including Acquisitions berkshire's
00:14:52.839 results have benefited from its
00:14:54.360 reputation and we don't want to do
00:14:56.480 anything that in any way can tarish it
00:14:58.880 like last year birkshire was ranked by
00:15:00.399 Fortune as the fourth most admired
00:15:02.079 company in the world this year we were
00:15:03.399 third in the United States they just
00:15:04.639 published it it took us 37 years to get
00:15:07.759 there but we could lose it in 37 minutes
00:15:10.639 and that's the message I mean we you
00:15:13.040 know we we can lose money it does you
00:15:14.920 know nicer to make money but we've got
00:15:17.680 we'll figure out ways to make money but
00:15:20.000 we can't lose a we can't lose a shredder
00:15:22.440 reputation because you don't get it back
00:15:24.639 and you can I I said 37 minutes but you
00:15:26.680 can lose it a lot faster than that you
00:15:28.240 can lose it in five minutes and and and
00:15:30.560 in fact I was talking to Bruce coming in
00:15:32.319 and he did some work around Solomon
00:15:34.279 Brothers and I went back there 11 years
00:15:38.399 ago because this
00:15:40.160 firm which had was the it had the second
00:15:43.480 largest balance sheet in the United
00:15:44.959 States at that that time it was it was a
00:15:48.040 preeminent firm on Wall Street John good
00:15:50.680 friend who would who ran it had his
00:15:53.759 picture on the front of business week as
00:15:55.839 the king of Wall
00:15:57.519 Street and in
00:15:59.920 April late in April
00:16:03.040 1991 he made a fateful decision it was
00:16:05.920 reported to him that an employee down
00:16:09.680 the line had flim flammed the US
00:16:12.079 Treasury had broken some rules tried to
00:16:14.600 play games with him and John did not
00:16:17.639 report that fact to the treasury or to
00:16:19.600 the Federal Reserve or to the SEC or to
00:16:22.720 anybody
00:16:23.639 else uh he didn't do anything wrong
00:16:26.319 himself but he just he he got behind the
00:16:30.040 curve he didn't report it the president
00:16:32.839 of the company Tommy Strauss didn't
00:16:34.360 report it if you saw that Katie curri
00:16:37.199 show on Sunday night on the Central Park
00:16:39.319 jogger uh Tom Strauss was on there but
00:16:41.720 Tom Strauss ended up getting losing his
00:16:44.319 he was president of Solomon Brothers
00:16:45.639 John was chairman John good friend uh
00:16:48.839 they didn't do anything they they
00:16:51.160 doled and after a few weeks the same guy
00:16:54.160 that had done committed the terrible
00:16:56.519 acts earlier on May 15th
00:16:59.480 he did the same thing again at a
00:17:00.880 treasury auction and now they were in
00:17:03.040 this terrible pickle because they had
00:17:05.319 known about this on about April 28th
00:17:07.799 this this guy was a bad actor and they
00:17:10.240 hadn't done anything and now on May 15th
00:17:12.000 he does the same thing again and now if
00:17:13.640 they go they they start feeling if they
00:17:15.039 go and talk about it you know the people
00:17:16.439 will say well why weren't you in here
00:17:18.160 before so they just kept trying to shove
00:17:20.400 it out of their mind and do other
00:17:22.359 things and it came within inches of
00:17:26.760 destroying the firm it destroyed their
00:17:28.400 careers I mean John good friend who
00:17:30.000 spent 30 years in Wall Street and had a
00:17:31.600 f fine reputation the king of Wall
00:17:34.120 Street was brought down by one simple
00:17:39.320 act uh of omission all he had to do was
00:17:42.440 pick up the phone Jerry Corgan was head
00:17:44.160 of the New York fed he had to pick up
00:17:45.640 the phone and say Jerry you won't
00:17:47.799 believe this but this crazy guy in our
00:17:49.679 Treasury Department uh fellow Nam moer
00:17:53.880 has just done this thing and I'm
00:17:55.360 terribly embarrassed and what can we do
00:17:56.799 to make it right I mean it you know and
00:17:58.880 Jerry Corgan being Jerry Corgan would
00:18:00.600 have turned red in the face and gotten
00:18:02.000 very mad and issued a lot of language I
00:18:04.280 couldn't repeat here but in the end he
00:18:05.720 would have said thanks for calling and
00:18:08.120 telling us about it immediately you know
00:18:10.159 and we'll slap a fine on you or do
00:18:11.760 whatever is appropriate and the and and
00:18:14.400 the next day The Firm would have gone on
00:18:17.200 fine but but John good friend actually
00:18:20.679 you know a perfectly okay guy but he
00:18:24.240 just he didn't act when it counted and
00:18:26.720 Tommy Strauss who was number two the
00:18:29.320 same way and later on they were fined
00:18:32.000 and and uh uh in a certain way kicked
00:18:35.679 out of the Securities industry and
00:18:37.240 Solomon barely survived 8,000 employees
00:18:40.400 around the world uh had their future in
00:18:43.480 real Jeopardy because of that single act
00:18:46.520 uh so just just apply the newspaper test
00:18:49.240 that's I I I tell our managers I could
00:18:51.400 have a thousand page book of Ethics I
00:18:53.200 got to have all kinds of rules and
00:18:54.720 hundreds of you know but in the end just
00:18:58.000 all you got to do is think about you
00:19:00.120 know do you really want what you're
00:19:01.400 doing put on the front page of the paper
00:19:03.080 tomorrow to be read by your parents by
00:19:05.559 your by your spouse by your kids by your
00:19:07.720 neighbors by your co-workers and if
00:19:09.880 you're embarrassed about it you know
00:19:11.679 just forget about it at uh you know that
00:19:14.320 you're all going to do well financially
00:19:16.640 you know the nice thing about it is you
00:19:18.600 know you live in America in the year
00:19:21.120 2003 you don't live in Bangladesh you
00:19:23.799 don't live in America you know of 1790
00:19:26.000 when it would you live in a you live in
00:19:28.200 a society
00:19:29.799 which has a GDP of over 10 trillion and
00:19:33.559 you you can just pick up the crumbs and
00:19:35.039 you're going to do great you know it's
00:19:37.120 you've all got the qualities it takes
00:19:38.720 three qualities essentially to do well
00:19:42.360 and extremely well actually in this
00:19:43.919 country it takes intelligence it takes
00:19:46.559 energy and it takes Integrity now
00:19:49.440 everybody in this room has the requisite
00:19:51.000 intelligence you wouldn't be here if you
00:19:52.320 didn't I mean it doesn't take 180 IQs
00:19:54.360 although I'm sure you all have those but
00:19:56.440 uh it it it it takes it takes reasonable
00:19:59.440 intelligence you're getting a great
00:20:01.440 education you've got the energy that's
00:20:03.760 why you're you know you've shown up uh
00:20:06.080 in school and it takes integrity and I
00:20:09.240 say if you don't have
00:20:10.880 integrity you know if we don't want to
00:20:13.559 hire somebody that's got intelligence
00:20:15.120 and energy if they don't have integrity
00:20:16.520 we'd rather hire somebody that's dumb
00:20:17.840 and lazy if they don't have integrity
00:20:19.840 because they probably will never get
00:20:20.720 around to cheating us or doing something
00:20:22.679 the last thing in the world I want is is
00:20:25.840 somebody that's lacks and moer had
00:20:27.679 intelligence and energy
00:20:29.320 at at Solomon he was he was head of the
00:20:31.080 government bond trading thing and he had
00:20:32.559 lots of intelligence and he lots of
00:20:34.400 energy and he went to jail uh and he and
00:20:37.320 he almost brought down the firm so and
00:20:39.840 integrity is absolutely an option you
00:20:42.200 know you may not be able to throw a
00:20:43.720 football 60 yards and you know you may
00:20:46.360 not be able to run the 100 in in in 98
00:20:48.760 you know you may not be able to syn
00:20:50.000 three po pointers from
00:20:52.400 but you can
00:20:54.440 choose where you stand on the Integrity
00:20:57.159 scale you can't you weren't born wired
00:21:00.080 one way or the other that is an absolute
00:21:02.039 choice you make uh and the heroes I've
00:21:05.520 had in life have been the people that I
00:21:07.200 felt stood out in that respect my number
00:21:09.520 one hero was my dad but I've had other
00:21:12.440 Heroes Tom Murphy Ben Graham people like
00:21:14.559 that and the reason I admired them was
00:21:18.000 not because they were the smartest
00:21:19.080 people in the world although they were
00:21:20.159 plent smart and it wasn't it wasn't
00:21:22.480 because they made the most money that
00:21:24.520 meant nothing it's really because I felt
00:21:27.799 they were the classiest people that I
00:21:30.799 ever met in my life I mean I saw them
00:21:33.120 behave over year after year after year
00:21:37.799 in a way that I could write their story
00:21:39.240 on the front page of any newspaper and
00:21:41.840 even in an unfriendly tone and I I could
00:21:44.000 not do anything that would embarrass
00:21:45.320 them in the least they they behaved
00:21:46.799 extraordinarily well and having the
00:21:48.480 right Heroes you know is is terribly
00:21:50.960 important you know you tell me who A
00:21:52.559 10-year-old's heroes are and I can give
00:21:54.919 you a pretty good prediction about about
00:21:57.240 how they're going to turn out you want
00:21:58.200 to Choose Your Heroes very carefully uh
00:22:01.400 because you're going to you're going to
00:22:03.039 look like them at some point uh and
00:22:05.640 you're lucky if you've got if youve got
00:22:08.400 the right ones I'll give you an a side
00:22:10.240 and we'll get on to your questions but
00:22:11.960 it's something you know you're not
00:22:12.960 parents yet most of you but if you when
00:22:16.039 you're a parent you are the natural hero
00:22:18.960 of your child I mean you I mean you know
00:22:21.360 you're this great big thing here there's
00:22:22.799 two of you great big things and there's
00:22:24.159 a little tiny child that pended on you
00:22:26.360 you are the natural hero and
00:22:29.720 and anything they get to school
00:22:31.880 subsequently anything else they're going
00:22:34.000 to be shaped more by what they see in
00:22:37.679 this behavior of of yours toward them
00:22:41.039 than than than anything that will impact
00:22:43.159 them uh later in their lives and if uh
00:22:47.039 uh they want you to be the hero you can
00:22:49.720 destroy that of course and you know
00:22:51.760 you've seen it done many many times but
00:22:54.200 but actually if the if the parents are
00:22:56.159 proper Heroes the the child is 90% of
00:22:59.279 the way home and uh you know you're
00:23:01.360 lucky if you've had parents like that
00:23:04.200 and you can be that to your children or
00:23:06.000 you can you can be something else and uh
00:23:09.320 you're shaping that person that the it's
00:23:11.720 nice to learn accounting when you get to
00:23:13.159 Nebraska but but the behavior model that
00:23:16.279 you take on is is incredibly important
00:23:18.760 let's talk about what's on your mind now
00:23:20.880 you can ask ask tough questions it's
00:23:23.120 more fun for me and uh they can be about
00:23:26.360 business they can be personal they can
00:23:27.840 be political you know you you pick it
00:23:31.080 out
00:23:35.200 and morning when you were rejected from
00:23:37.880 uh Harvard Business
00:23:40.120 School um is obviously somewhat of a
00:23:42.640 failure in your mind how did you uh how
00:23:44.600 do you adapt to your failures in life to
00:23:46.440 make you more successful yeah well
00:23:48.440 that's that's a very good question you
00:23:49.960 know how do you turn failure into a plus
00:23:52.480 uh and it's true when I was at the
00:23:55.159 University of Nebraska one day I was
00:23:57.200 reading the daily Nebraskan
00:23:59.799 and it said in Room 300 or something at
00:24:04.720 3:00 there will be this panel of three
00:24:08.200 uh uh professors here at the University
00:24:11.520 and they're going to award the Nathan
00:24:12.960 gold scholarship I don't know whether
00:24:14.240 you still you still have that around and
00:24:16.159 at the
00:24:17.000 time uh it said it would give you $500
00:24:19.840 to go to The Graduate School of your
00:24:21.279 choice I don't know whether it's change
00:24:22.799 in amount but but that that was it so I
00:24:25.399 read this and I went there to this room
00:24:28.960 at 3:00 that day or whatever it was and
00:24:31.520 I walked in the room and there were the
00:24:34.360 professors and I was the only student
00:24:36.360 that showed up I mean it really got to
00:24:37.960 them I mean they they were stuck they
00:24:40.600 you know they kept waiting and looking
00:24:41.880 at their watch and hoping there' be more
00:24:43.320 candidates but there no one came in so I
00:24:46.559 won $500 by by default
00:24:50.279 and those are usually my biggest
00:24:52.360 triumphs when nobody else shows
00:24:54.760 up and so here I was I had $500 to go
00:24:58.760 toward any it wasn't it wasn't limited
00:25:01.640 as any any graduate school for a
00:25:03.520 master's degree so I applied to Harvard
00:25:05.279 my dad wanted me
00:25:06.600 to and uh uh I shortly heard from
00:25:11.120 Harvard and they said go to Chicago and
00:25:13.919 meet this fellow running that who
00:25:16.080 interviews applicants from the Midwest
00:25:19.000 so I got on the train and that's what
00:25:20.679 you did in those days and I spent about
00:25:22.960 10 hours on the Burlington going to
00:25:25.520 Chicago then I transferred to another
00:25:27.679 little in trained to go up to this
00:25:29.520 Country Day School where this fellow was
00:25:31.120 the Headmaster and he was the big
00:25:32.559 interviewer for Harvard and I got there
00:25:35.279 and after about 10 minutes he he said
00:25:39.919 better think about something else but uh
00:25:42.600 you know he uh come back later on I I
00:25:45.159 was 19 at the time and uh I looked about
00:25:49.039 12 you know and and I and I acted about
00:25:52.399 eight it was not a great combination uh
00:25:55.559 but so he he said forget it so I SP I
00:25:58.720 took the little in urban train back to
00:26:00.600 Chicago and I took the 10-hour train
00:26:02.159 back to omont all the time think you
00:26:03.520 know what do I tell my parents you know
00:26:04.799 it's kind of embarrassing uh but it was
00:26:08.520 it was the luckiest thing ever happened
00:26:09.679 to me I
00:26:12.440 because if I'd gone to Harvard I would
00:26:14.520 have gone to a two-year business school
00:26:18.039 i i i instead applied to Columbia where
00:26:20.600 I could graduate in one year and get a
00:26:21.960 master's
00:26:23.039 degree
00:26:24.919 luckily that by the accident of it and
00:26:27.600 being in NE National Guard which did not
00:26:29.480 get called up for the Korean War I
00:26:31.799 missed going in the Korean
00:26:34.760 War
00:26:37.720 I I got to meet Ben Graham and which had
00:26:40.640 an enormous effect on me
00:26:42.480 subsequently and I probably got my wife
00:26:45.159 that way because she was going to
00:26:47.279 Northwestern and I was able to put on
00:26:49.960 sort of a full court press because I got
00:26:51.799 out in one year and otherwise uh she
00:26:54.919 she'd have met some other guy I mean I I
00:26:56.600 got her before the competition showed up
00:26:58.399 and uh so it worked out wonderfully it
00:27:01.600 couldn't have worked out better and
00:27:04.039 that's been that's been my life
00:27:05.679 basically I mean it the things you know
00:27:08.440 you will get some disappointments you
00:27:10.159 know uh but the future is what
00:27:14.559 counts be
00:27:16.320 fun if I knew every decision I was going
00:27:19.240 to make was going to be perfect it would
00:27:20.640 not be as much fun be like playing golf
00:27:22.279 and knowing you're going to hit a hole
00:27:23.679 in one on every hole you wouldn't play
00:27:25.720 golf if every time you got on of te you
00:27:28.799 just took a swing and the ball ended up
00:27:30.120 in the hole you know be fun for a few
00:27:31.960 days you get get on TV but it the game
00:27:35.159 would not be any fun so it's failure you
00:27:38.240 know and I wouldn't even consider them
00:27:40.240 failures but they're mistakes or
00:27:41.720 whatever you want to call they're
00:27:43.279 they're part of the game and in the end
00:27:46.440 you know you go on and and we've made
00:27:48.799 plenty of mistakes in business we'll
00:27:50.399 make plenty more and the you know the
00:27:53.919 Babe Ruth and you know for a long time
00:27:56.519 it subsequently got eclipsed by
00:27:58.720 a few fellas but uh he held the record
00:28:01.039 for strikeouts you know he also hel the
00:28:02.880 record for home runs and was I as
00:28:04.320 baseball player until the modern era
00:28:06.679 came along so it's it's part of the game
00:28:09.240 if you take big swings you know you you
00:28:11.640 may you may you're going to miss
00:28:13.279 sometimes um but
00:28:17.360 the uh you know the Harvard thing you'll
00:28:19.919 get a kick out of this maybe I I they
00:28:22.760 invited me back to the 25th anniversary
00:28:24.600 of this class to talk to them uh and I
00:28:27.640 went back
00:28:29.039 it was It was kind of embarrassing
00:28:30.559 because this was the 25th reunion and
00:28:33.279 and the class was talking about the next
00:28:35.080 25 years to these alumni that were back
00:28:37.519 after 25 years and my job was to talk
00:28:39.679 about the next 20 your financial future
00:28:42.120 in the next 25 years this was in
00:28:44.840 whenever it was in the mid 70s and right
00:28:47.600 before me on the program Masters and
00:28:50.039 Johnson were talking out next 25 years
00:28:52.399 of their sex lives so nobody stayed
00:28:54.240 around for for my talk but that night
00:28:57.679 that night at the uh at the alumni
00:28:59.279 meeting they um the fellow was pres of
00:29:02.080 class to up he said you know we're big
00:29:03.320 enough to make admit when we make
00:29:04.799 mistakes around here and we turn this
00:29:06.120 guy down throw him back in the water and
00:29:08.640 uh so now we'd like to make him an
00:29:09.960 honorary member of the class uh so they
00:29:12.600 did it and they voted and everybody vote
00:29:14.159 to foron and I stood up and I said uh I
00:29:16.360 recited the story that I told you and I
00:29:19.159 told him you know I said at the time I
00:29:21.720 was kind of philosophical about this you
00:29:24.760 know I was young and maybe my grades
00:29:26.679 weren't that good or something and so
00:29:28.200 took the took the rejection kind of well
00:29:30.440 but I said now that I've met the people
00:29:32.279 that got in the class I'm really
00:29:40.960 sore okay who's
00:29:44.960 next
00:29:49.120 yeah you you can ask it I'll repeat it
00:29:51.559 yeah um I guess my question for you was
00:29:53.799 after you're dead how do you want to be
00:29:55.519 remembered and how do you go about and
00:29:58.200 how do you go about in your daily life
00:30:00.480 ensuring that you're going to be
00:30:01.559 remembered in that yeah well really I
00:30:03.559 only want the the minister to say one
00:30:05.600 thing at my funeral if he gets up there
00:30:09.559 and they play a few little HS and
00:30:10.919 everything uh maybe they'll play there
00:30:12.760 as no place like Nebraska i''d be great
00:30:15.640 I just want him to stay up there and say
00:30:17.880 my God he was old you
00:30:22.440 know I'll settle for that
00:30:29.399 but the truth is that to some extent
00:30:31.080 Burkshire is my creation so I would like
00:30:34.880 people to the extent that people regard
00:30:37.200 that well that's what CS I mean that's
00:30:39.279 my painting and and and I hope that
00:30:42.880 people look at I've been running out for
00:30:45.640 almost 38 years about just about 38
00:30:47.440 years exactly and that means I only got
00:30:49.559 another 30 or 40 to go and uh I hope
00:30:52.679 that uh that we have done some things
00:30:55.200 differently than other corporations
00:30:56.519 we've operated on a on a different model
00:30:59.399 and I hope two things about it actually
00:31:01.000 I hope a that that people realize that
00:31:03.919 that model works and why it works and so
00:31:05.960 on because it is it does conflict with
00:31:08.159 certain management Theory over the years
00:31:11.600 and
00:31:12.559 secondly uh the the important thing is
00:31:14.960 that it that it lasts well beyond me I
00:31:17.720 was down at Walmart six months ago and
00:31:20.880 talked to their Management Group and was
00:31:23.519 I had a great time what is really
00:31:26.639 astounding I voted for Walmart is the
00:31:28.880 most admired company in the in the
00:31:30.360 country last year that was my that's
00:31:31.639 where my vote
00:31:33.159 went it was astounding what Sam Walton
00:31:35.880 built starting in Bentonville Arkansas
00:31:37.559 with a pickup truck taking on JC Penney
00:31:40.200 and Kmart and Sears and all of these
00:31:42.120 people with no money you know no real
00:31:45.159 estate no preference with vendors no
00:31:48.120 credit card list anything he just took
00:31:49.880 them on and of course he just ran ran
00:31:51.480 away from them but the really impressive
00:31:53.480 thing about Walmart is that Sam died
00:31:56.039 about 11 years ago and that there's been
00:31:59.279 no momentum lost I mean what he
00:32:00.960 instilled in that company nobody else
00:32:02.519 could have built it like Sam but David
00:32:04.919 glass first and Lee Scott now as the CEO
00:32:08.360 they have kept that company with its
00:32:10.880 special culture uh going at Full Steam
00:32:14.880 ever since and that that's really what I
00:32:16.799 hope you know happens with Berkshire and
00:32:18.679 I've tried to think about ways to to
00:32:20.960 make that happen but the real test will
00:32:23.279 be if 10 or 20 years after I die that
00:32:28.039 the special culture that I think is part
00:32:29.720 of Berkshire is not only just as strong
00:32:31.519 as ever but even stronger uh we have a
00:32:34.480 situation at
00:32:35.679 Berkshire where in 38 years we got all
00:32:40.440 kinds of CEOs out there running all
00:32:41.960 kinds of businesses three or four of
00:32:43.840 them in Omaha we have never had one CEO
00:32:47.840 ever leave us period to go someplace
00:32:51.159 else I mean I don't think I don't know
00:32:53.159 that there's any place like that in the
00:32:54.279 country so it's it's been a and we've
00:32:56.600 never issued a stock option you know you
00:32:58.639 know you read in the papers that you you
00:33:00.279 know you got to have stock options to
00:33:01.480 attract quality people that sort of
00:33:03.039 thing I we never had we've never had had
00:33:05.399 a share of them and and and
00:33:08.399 and in the end I don't know how many
00:33:10.600 dozens of managers were talking about
00:33:12.360 but no one has ever has ever left for
00:33:15.399 another job and uh some them been
00:33:18.679 offered way more
00:33:19.960 money uh in fact a g Jane who runs our
00:33:22.880 reinsurance operation probably could
00:33:25.120 have
00:33:26.000 increased his income 10 times tfold now
00:33:30.519 he's already making many millions but
00:33:32.480 but
00:33:33.639 tenfold but he doesn't want to leave and
00:33:36.440 that is the culture that I hope we can
00:33:39.039 maintain and that's what I'd really like
00:33:40.519 to be uh you
00:33:42.600 know if I've done anything to contribute
00:33:44.960 to that continuing after I die that
00:33:47.679 would that would be terrific of course I
00:33:49.399 I I actually plan to keep managing
00:33:50.799 burshire after I die you have to
00:33:52.480 understand that I I have given all the
00:33:54.519 managers Ouija boards you know and I've
00:33:57.480 got dark rooms are going to go into and
00:34:00.000 I'll be
00:34:02.120 there Mrs B at at the rasa ferning Park
00:34:05.080 worked to3 at Berkshire and she's she's
00:34:07.679 sort of our examples and and then she
00:34:10.079 then she took off from work and she died
00:34:12.159 the next year so it's very dangerous to
00:34:14.239 to uh quit as early as
00:34:17.440 that yeah I am I supposed to be calling
00:34:21.560 on these people okay
00:34:23.119 good how do you determine be your
00:34:25.280 personal finances what organizations
00:34:28.159 you give your money to on Personal
00:34:30.520 Finance how how do I handle them or how
00:34:32.679 do you determine what where you make
00:34:34.320 your donations oh well uh we've got a
00:34:39.320 there's a buffet Foundation uh
00:34:41.520 eventually it will have everything I
00:34:43.280 mean basically everything I've made will
00:34:45.079 go back to society America's been done
00:34:47.079 it for me and you know it should that's
00:34:48.839 where it should go um uh I have I've got
00:34:53.520 about an eight Page
00:34:55.079 Letter that the trustees have already
00:34:57.200 seen in there's very few trustees I
00:34:59.320 don't believe in large groups of people
00:35:01.440 making decisions it gets to be you know
00:35:03.880 sort of descends to the lowest common
00:35:05.599 nominator so there's only what maybe
00:35:07.839 five or six trustees uh interestingly
00:35:10.839 enough not just by accident but I picked
00:35:13.599 the people who I trust in the most in
00:35:16.119 terms of both their intelligence but
00:35:18.880 also their quality uh to run it after I
00:35:22.280 people I feel the shest of uh a
00:35:24.240 significant majority will be women it'll
00:35:25.800 be a women woman controlled foundation
00:35:28.560 and probably the largest foundation in
00:35:29.880 the world at the time uh but with a very
00:35:32.079 small number of manager uh trustees I
00:35:34.880 have in in my letter I tell them that
00:35:38.079 I'm not going to give them any specific
00:35:39.839 instructions as to what to do with the
00:35:41.720 money uh I tell them that their judgment
00:35:45.079 above ground will be better than my
00:35:46.560 judgment six feet underground so in the
00:35:49.520 end I want them but I want them to do a
00:35:52.400 couple of things I want them to attack
00:35:55.040 really big important causes I don't want
00:35:57.839 them to give a million dollars here and
00:35:59.119 a million dollars there and everybody
00:36:00.760 that you know that asks that they know
00:36:02.720 and that sort of thing so I don't want
00:36:03.960 them doing things with an eye dropper uh
00:36:06.200 I want them to swing take very big
00:36:08.480 swings and then I want them to measure
00:36:10.800 what they're doing by the importance of
00:36:13.560 what they're doing as contrasted to the
00:36:16.440 Natural funding constituency for that
00:36:19.119 now taking the health field I mean you
00:36:20.560 got the National Institute of heal
00:36:21.839 spending billions and billions of
00:36:23.160 dollars you got all kinds of money going
00:36:24.440 into medical research it'd be crazy in
00:36:26.480 my view for the Buffett Foundation
00:36:28.280 to be engaged in medical research it's
00:36:30.000 not that the subjects isn't important
00:36:31.680 but there's already a huge funding
00:36:33.319 constituency it would be crazy for the
00:36:35.280 money to go to Harvard or something of
00:36:36.760 the sort it isn't it isn't a fine
00:36:38.119 educational institution but you've got
00:36:40.119 all of these people that that give money
00:36:42.240 to Harvard and they've got a richual
00:36:43.640 onni base and all of that sort of thing
00:36:45.560 so I want the combination of a terribly
00:36:48.079 important program and the lack of a
00:36:50.480 natural funding constituency well where
00:36:52.720 do you find that you find that with
00:36:53.880 unpopular causes to quite a degree uh
00:36:56.520 Rockefeller felt some the same way it's
00:36:59.160 interesting he was the first major
00:37:02.440 patron of any sort of of black colleges
00:37:05.880 in the United States now if you think
00:37:07.520 about it black colleges had no funding
00:37:10.720 constituency I mean their their alumni
00:37:12.720 didn't have any money basically if you
00:37:14.560 go back 75 or 100 years so there wasn't
00:37:17.119 any money coming and people didn't you
00:37:19.160 know they didn't build great businesses
00:37:20.760 and then and then leave tens or hundreds
00:37:23.200 of millions of dollars to the
00:37:24.359 institution and it was it was
00:37:26.079 self-perpetuating
00:37:27.520 and so rockerfeller stepped in and he he
00:37:29.680 took a group of black colleges and
00:37:31.119 funded them in a very very big way and I
00:37:34.119 I I admire that kind of a decision
00:37:35.599 enormously it wouldn't otherwise nothing
00:37:37.760 would have happened and and that's what
00:37:40.000 I hope the trustees of the the buffet
00:37:42.920 Foundation do I was with Bill Gates last
00:37:46.280 week with and I consider his foundation
00:37:49.160 he and Melinda together because they're
00:37:50.920 equal Partners in it I consider their
00:37:53.359 Foundation to be the most logical big
00:37:55.640 foundation in the world there giving
00:37:57.800 away about a billion dollars a year now
00:38:00.480 Bill said to and Melinda said to
00:38:02.960 themselves how do we save the most lives
00:38:05.599 per dollar spent in the
00:38:08.400 world and they decided that in certain
00:38:11.520 major medical areas that what was being
00:38:14.400 done abroad in many countries was zilch
00:38:17.880 in terms of these things that were
00:38:19.000 easily preventable by vaccines or
00:38:21.720 various other things and they decided
00:38:23.200 they could save huge numbers of lives
00:38:25.680 per billion dollars spent but they'd be
00:38:27.960 spending it you know in places like
00:38:29.560 India and all in Africa where they would
00:38:31.280 get no credit in the United States I
00:38:32.520 mean no buildings with their names no
00:38:33.920 nothing but that was their metric and
00:38:36.200 that's that's Bill's Soul metric I mean
00:38:38.119 he he doesn't want to talk about you can
00:38:39.920 go to him with some proposition to stick
00:38:41.319 his name on something you know for $50
00:38:42.760 million it doesn't interest him at all
00:38:45.119 he is it's a totally rational one and he
00:38:47.200 pours himself into it uh he he has
00:38:50.280 educated himself on on medicine and
00:38:52.960 particularly medicine outside the United
00:38:54.640 States in a way that I've never seen
00:38:56.040 anybody and I've got to do good news for
00:38:58.280 this you should write down on May 2nd on
00:39:01.359 public broadcasting there will be a
00:39:03.839 program uh where Bill with Bill Moyers
00:39:07.440 Bill Moyers is interviewing him and Bill
00:39:09.800 explains his philanthropic
00:39:12.240 thinking and it it I I went there it was
00:39:16.079 taped at Columbia University and fact
00:39:18.000 you may even see me in the audience
00:39:19.160 sitting next to Melinda but the that
00:39:21.880 that is it's going to be a great program
00:39:24.000 they took about an hour and 20 minutes
00:39:25.440 and it's going to get edited down to 56
00:39:27.079 or 8 minutes but you will hear as you
00:39:31.280 will hear as cogent an argument of for
00:39:34.960 rational philanthropy on that program as
00:39:37.800 you'll ever hear in in your life so I I
00:39:40.880 it's it's interesting that program came
00:39:42.280 about because about two years ago I
00:39:44.760 asked Bill a question at a group I get
00:39:47.960 together something to what you asked him
00:39:49.599 I asked him to talk about the evolution
00:39:51.440 of his philanthropic thinking and there
00:39:54.000 were a group of about 60 of us there and
00:39:55.640 he talked to us and I mean it was a
00:39:58.319 fabulous talk and I I just I said you
00:40:01.040 know you got to get that out in the
00:40:02.359 public domain somehow so so this thing
00:40:04.680 with B wers does that uh if I die
00:40:09.319 tonight all my Burkshire shares which
00:40:12.359 are 99% of my net worth plus go to my
00:40:15.599 wife uh she dies first hers go to me and
00:40:19.079 then it all goes to the buffet
00:40:20.720 foundation and it will then be active on
00:40:24.520 a on a very big big scale and those are
00:40:28.760 the guidelines
00:40:30.240 and uh who knows what those problems
00:40:33.160 will be I mean it it probably it might
00:40:36.000 well have been civil rights in the early
00:40:37.560 60s I mean the Civil Rights
00:40:40.400 organizations you know were not being
00:40:42.200 funded by anybody and I mean it money
00:40:45.359 wasn't the big problem but it was a
00:40:47.240 problem for in the Civil Rights Arena
00:40:50.240 and uh uh there was no natural funding
00:40:54.160 constituency for that it was an
00:40:56.160 important very important issue but it
00:40:57.920 was an unpopular issue in many respects
00:41:00.079 uh and seems to me that's where the
00:41:02.240 money money should go particularly if
00:41:04.400 you have it on a big scale where you can
00:41:05.920 really do something uh depends when I
00:41:09.160 die but but you know 10 or 15 years from
00:41:12.640 now the foundation could really I mean
00:41:14.880 it could have a lot of money and and uh
00:41:17.720 uh so they could do some things that
00:41:19.400 nobody else could attempt and it won't
00:41:21.680 be what people want them to do you know
00:41:23.440 that's the nature of it if it was what
00:41:24.880 people wanted to do it would already be
00:41:26.119 being done uh interesting thing the
00:41:29.040 contrast between business and
00:41:30.400 philanthropy is interesting in business
00:41:32.640 I swing at easy pitches I stand there at
00:41:34.760 the plate and if I like pitches one inch
00:41:37.560 above my Naval right in the center of
00:41:38.960 the plate I can wait and wait and wait
00:41:41.720 because there's no called strikes you
00:41:43.400 know that as long as that bat's on my
00:41:44.920 shoulder nobody's calling a strike if if
00:41:47.079 the pitches throws me General Motors at
00:41:48.880 36 IBM at 82 Microsoft at 25 and I don't
00:41:52.720 swing it's not a strike it's not a hit
00:41:55.280 either but it's not a strike I only when
00:41:57.280 I swing is at a strike so I wait for
00:41:58.720 easy pitches I wait for things I
00:42:01.040 understand exactly in my sweet spot
00:42:03.800 philanthropy is just the opposite you're
00:42:06.160 looking at the toughest problems the
00:42:08.040 world faces and they're intractable to
00:42:10.560 some extent I mean these are tough tough
00:42:12.800 problems and they have
00:42:16.680 resisted you the utilization of money
00:42:19.599 over the years and that's what makes
00:42:21.520 them tough problems I mean the problems
00:42:23.280 you can solve with money are the easy
00:42:24.480 ones it's the problems you can't solve
00:42:25.760 with money so they are very our problem
00:42:27.800 one one thing I've gotten involved in
00:42:29.680 just a little bit recently is something
00:42:31.000 that Sam nun is heading Senator former
00:42:33.280 Senator called the nuclear threat
00:42:35.000 initiative and uh essentially I Sam nun
00:42:39.400 who was who is as well informed as
00:42:42.559 anybody in the world on the subject in
00:42:44.079 articulate and everything is working on
00:42:46.000 the problem of
00:42:48.760 the nuclear
00:42:51.200 materials uh Andor nuclear Talent uh
00:42:55.680 that exists around the world that might
00:42:57.599 become available to terrorists or to to
00:43:00.480 uh governments uh to impose on the rest
00:43:03.680 of the society and and there vast
00:43:06.359 amounts of of uh uranium and lesser
00:43:10.680 amounts of plutonium and there's a lot
00:43:12.079 of unemployed Russian scientists and so
00:43:13.839 on so this is something that Ted Turner
00:43:16.400 actually set up a couple of years ago
00:43:18.760 and got Sam to handle and because AOL
00:43:21.920 Time Warner stock which was being used
00:43:23.880 to fund it from Ted has gone down a lot
00:43:26.400 in price they they they run short of
00:43:28.280 money so that's that's something I'm
00:43:29.480 involved in it doesn't uh you know it's
00:43:31.599 not something that has a popular appeal
00:43:33.280 you can't raise you can't send out
00:43:35.200 something get hundreds of thousands of
00:43:36.520 people to respond but but uh that's the
00:43:39.559 kind of thing that I think you know the
00:43:41.920 foundation should be
00:43:43.680 doing yeah um with the government
00:43:46.960 possibly considering eliminating double
00:43:49.000 taxation on dividends would you ever
00:43:50.920 consider declaring a dividend on your
00:43:52.960 Stu and what kind of decision- making
00:43:55.520 process do you go through when you're
00:43:57.720 yeah the question is with the government
00:44:01.079 uh considering eliminating the double
00:44:02.599 taxation on dividends would that change
00:44:04.319 our attitude at Burkshire toward toward
00:44:06.720 paying dividends and what sort of
00:44:09.240 decisionmaking uh framework do we have
00:44:11.640 about whether we pay dividence or not uh
00:44:15.599 Berkshire I took it over
00:44:18.079 1965 and we paid 10 cents a share one
00:44:20.640 year happened in the late 60s I I can't
00:44:22.680 remember it I blocked it out of my mind
00:44:24.280 I must have been in the men's room or
00:44:25.440 something but because that was the only
00:44:28.079 dividend we paid uh the determination is
00:44:32.040 very simple on dividends is can we
00:44:35.880 retain a dollar or a billion dollars or
00:44:38.920 whatever the amount is of
00:44:40.720 earnings and have that dollar become
00:44:43.160 worth more than a dollar uh in immediate
00:44:46.079 present value now even though it may not
00:44:47.680 get used for a few years or something of
00:44:49.119 the sort in other words our weak is that
00:44:50.880 dollar worth more than a dollar if kept
00:44:53.440 in the business forgetting about taxes
00:44:54.839 entirely let's assume a total taxfree
00:44:56.680 Society
00:44:58.000 uh in terms of
00:44:59.119 dividends and the answer to that so far
00:45:02.880 has been yes we have kept the dollars
00:45:05.720 that we've earned and we have created
00:45:07.960 more than a dollar of market value for
00:45:09.880 every dollar we've retained and as long
00:45:12.680 as we can do that it's silly to pay out
00:45:14.119 a dollar even if it's not taxed and put
00:45:15.960 it in my pocket where it's still only
00:45:18.079 worth a dollar if I can create more than
00:45:19.559 a dollar's worth of value in the stock
00:45:21.800 so we have done that now for a lot of
00:45:24.119 years doesn't mean we can do it forever
00:45:26.280 but we've done it for a lot of years and
00:45:27.800 that that is the test and you will find
00:45:29.839 in the back of the Burkshire hathway
00:45:31.240 annual report which we'll be glad to
00:45:33.240 send any of you uh it's on the internet
00:45:35.319 also but you'll find in the back of the
00:45:37.880 burshire report something that isn't in
00:45:39.280 any other report that I know of it's
00:45:41.359 something called the economic principles
00:45:42.760 of Burkshire Hathaway that's been in the
00:45:44.960 report every year now for at least 20
00:45:48.119 years and those principles don't change
00:45:50.960 that's why they're principles you know
00:45:52.359 and and it's why I'm willing to lay them
00:45:53.800 out I mean if if I act in conflict with
00:45:56.240 those principles expect the owners to
00:45:58.440 you know to call me out but I look at
00:46:00.359 the investors in Berkshire as my partner
00:46:03.680 now I'm the managing partner they can't
00:46:05.839 because I own so much stock they can't
00:46:07.480 do much about me uh so they ought to
00:46:09.960 they ought to know what the game is when
00:46:11.520 they if they join us and that doesn't
00:46:13.200 mean everybody wants to join us but they
00:46:15.000 ought to know what the rules are just as
00:46:16.440 if you and I were starting a partnership
00:46:18.240 and I was going to run it you'd want to
00:46:19.480 know you know how we were going to
00:46:21.240 conduct business and what my thoughts
00:46:22.599 were and what my time Horizon was would
00:46:24.280 we ever sell would I make distributions
00:46:26.559 all that kind of thing
00:46:28.559 so that those principles cover this
00:46:32.720 point you raised I don't forget whether
00:46:34.040 it's the third or fourth one or
00:46:35.040 something like that but but it's it's
00:46:36.640 explained there and I want people to I
00:46:38.440 want our owners to understand it I mean
00:46:39.960 I I look at every owner when I write my
00:46:42.000 annual letter to share holders which
00:46:44.240 takes me an ungodly amount of time I
00:46:46.040 it's miserable but uh nevertheless it's
00:46:48.520 important because it is the one time a
00:46:50.680 year I'm talking to my partners and when
00:46:53.040 I started out I actually mentally put
00:46:57.400 dear Doris and birdie because those are
00:46:59.200 my sisters and they have all their money
00:47:02.680 in birkshire they're smart they're but
00:47:06.119 they're not Financial types I mean
00:47:07.599 they're not spending their time on that
00:47:09.480 and I and I essentially want to be
00:47:11.680 talking to them as bright people who
00:47:15.800 don't know a lot of financial jargon
00:47:17.400 necessarily you know but they're but
00:47:19.359 they'll but they're interested enough
00:47:20.680 that they'll read a lot because they got
00:47:22.119 all their money in it so I I don't have
00:47:23.440 to worry about keeping it short or
00:47:24.640 anything like that if I if I'm talking
00:47:26.920 bought their money I probably got their
00:47:28.400 interest and I I take that off at the
00:47:32.319 very end and then I take off DE dois and
00:47:33.800 bir I put to the shareholders of
00:47:34.960 Berkshire but I want to tell them
00:47:37.480 exactly what they're in I want it to be
00:47:39.440 just as if our roles were reversed
00:47:41.680 that's always the test if Doris and
00:47:43.440 birdie were running the place and I was
00:47:45.160 living in carmell California like birdie
00:47:47.200 is what would I want to hear from them
00:47:49.760 the managers and I would one of the
00:47:51.559 things I'd want to hear is just exactly
00:47:53.079 the question that you asked you know
00:47:54.839 what is what is your attitude about
00:47:56.880 Distributing money from the from the
00:47:58.960 company because I get to make that
00:48:01.400 decision along with the board of
00:48:02.520 directors and they don't and some
00:48:04.800 managements withhold money that really
00:48:07.280 belongs to their owners because they
00:48:09.880 like building a a kingdom some of them
00:48:12.480 you know do it out of fear or anything
00:48:14.359 like that I think I'm doing it for a
00:48:15.800 rational reason and I want to explain
00:48:17.240 that reason but I tell them how to test
00:48:18.599 me on that too because I think I should
00:48:20.559 be tested and and it's it's a it's a
00:48:23.240 very
00:48:24.760 important uh relationship
00:48:27.720 that really has deteriorated over the
00:48:30.640 years in my view between management and
00:48:32.640 owners I mean you you've seen in the
00:48:34.920 last 10 years a slippage in my view of
00:48:38.920 the
00:48:40.440 behavior of American CEOs I mean
00:48:43.760 obviously all kinds of exceptions but uh
00:48:46.680 it's very interesting because they're
00:48:48.400 not Crooks or anything those there's a
00:48:49.839 few and they gotten a lot of publicity
00:48:51.799 lately but nevertheless they have
00:48:54.400 behaved as most humans do they sort of
00:48:57.040 picked up the behavior of those around
00:48:58.680 them that's why it t pays to hang out
00:49:00.760 with people better than you are I mean
00:49:02.640 you know if you hang out with people
00:49:04.200 better than you are you'll become better
00:49:06.079 yourself at uh uh everybody behaves
00:49:09.559 better that's around my wife you know I
00:49:11.160 mean even including me starting from a
00:49:13.720 low base uh but the she just has that
00:49:17.440 effect on people and other people pull
00:49:19.599 you down I mean you know when I was in
00:49:21.160 the National Garden we would go to Camp
00:49:23.160 you know in about an hour I was reading
00:49:24.599 comic books you know pretty sure
00:49:26.240 everybody's reading in comic books and
00:49:27.680 the language you know you know every
00:49:30.079 every other word becomes some form of
00:49:31.799 profanity everything it just you sink
00:49:34.079 well what happened to American CEOs in
00:49:36.079 the in in the 90s is that they they the
00:49:39.640 behavior the situational
00:49:42.119 ethics sort of caused behavioral Norms
00:49:45.839 to to sink I say it was a little like
00:49:49.079 how may West described her career she
00:49:51.119 said I was Snow White but I
00:49:53.119 drifted and American management drifted
00:49:56.520 uh uh to to quite a degree during that
00:49:58.880 during that period uh uh I think it's I
00:50:01.720 think it's very
00:50:03.520 important you know what that
00:50:05.240 relationship is people have given you
00:50:07.119 their money at Berkshire haway or any
00:50:08.799 other company and and I'm I'm a I'm a
00:50:11.799 I'm a a trustee for them in effect and
00:50:14.160 then the question is they ought to since
00:50:16.319 I control the place they ought to know
00:50:19.119 the yard sticks so if you do go to our
00:50:22.119 website go to the back of the report and
00:50:24.280 there's something that says economic
00:50:25.440 principles and we try to discuss
00:50:26.839 everything that's important and I tell
00:50:29.359 them I'm going to put them in there
00:50:30.200 every year so that they can you know
00:50:32.160 they can hold me
00:50:34.319 accountable yeah you talked quite a bit
00:50:37.400 about the flexibility your many
00:50:39.119 different companies and so forth if you
00:50:40.599 could elaborate a little bit on the
00:50:42.359 personal qualities and professional
00:50:44.359 qualities that you look in in those
00:50:46.040 Executives that you place those compan
00:50:48.280 yeah and and the question is about the
00:50:49.960 personal quality we look for in the in
00:50:51.680 the executives we place at our various
00:50:53.520 companies the first thing is we don't
00:50:55.400 usually place them I mean they come with
00:50:56.920 them uh we don't have anybody to place
00:50:59.480 so I have the problem occasionally if
00:51:02.040 somebody dies or uh to replace a CEO but
00:51:08.160 most of our CEOs came with the deal
00:51:10.839 Clayton hommes which were were buying
00:51:12.599 comes with Kevin Clayton run running it
00:51:14.480 we will put no one in there he will run
00:51:16.960 the place just as before but in terms of
00:51:19.400 the personal quality when when a when a
00:51:21.640 seller comes to me with a business
00:51:24.240 whether it's Clayton or any of the the
00:51:26.000 others Ike fredman at borim uh Mrs B at
00:51:29.440 Nebraska for nature Mark when they come
00:51:30.920 to me the first question I have to ask
00:51:33.520 myself because I'm counting on them to
00:51:34.880 run the place I have to decide what do
00:51:37.680 they love the money or do they love the
00:51:39.960 business now there's nothing wrong with
00:51:41.799 liking the money I mean they all like
00:51:43.079 money but but they've got to love the
00:51:45.119 business they got to have a passion for
00:51:46.640 it because if I give them a whole bunch
00:51:48.440 of money and they love the money and
00:51:49.559 they don't love the business no matter
00:51:51.440 what they tell me 6 months from now
00:51:52.920 they'll be gone you know I mean they'll
00:51:54.799 just all of a sudden say why am I
00:51:55.880 getting up at 7 in the morning just so I
00:51:57.280 can send a lot of money to Omaha you
00:51:58.720 know I mean it it just it won't work so
00:52:02.280 they have to love the business I mean I
00:52:03.920 want people with a passion for the
00:52:05.400 business I used to say that I had a
00:52:07.440 oneline employment form one question
00:52:10.119 employment form the question was are you
00:52:11.960 a fanatic you know if you answered yes
00:52:13.839 you got the job because I want
00:52:15.280 somebody's fanatic about their business
00:52:18.000 you know I mean you want people that
00:52:19.720 love teaching if if if if if you're in a
00:52:22.000 classroom you know you if they don't
00:52:24.480 have the passion for it it it doesn't
00:52:26.640 work very well so I now if they've got
00:52:28.839 the
00:52:29.640 passion and and our managers do but but
00:52:33.480 not everybody would uh the financial
00:52:36.040 operators don't we've never bought a
00:52:37.400 business from an lbo operator a
00:52:38.880 financial operator but they don't they
00:52:40.599 don't give a damn I mean all they want
00:52:41.960 to do is make sure your check clears and
00:52:43.880 and they're gone and it isn't going to
00:52:46.000 work if we try to buy from them so we
00:52:47.760 buy from these people who love their
00:52:48.920 businesses and and then really my job is
00:52:53.000 just to make sure that I don't mess it
00:52:55.960 up and create conditions that cause them
00:52:57.839 to quit loving it for some reason
00:52:59.200 because they come in loving it only I
00:53:01.359 can only I can mess it up and they care
00:53:04.720 about being treated fairly on
00:53:06.200 compensation but they don't measure it
00:53:08.000 against everybody else they don't have a
00:53:10.119 lawyer they're negotiating with me I
00:53:11.520 mean I don't have a compensation
00:53:13.839 arrangement with any of these managers
00:53:15.920 that can't be put in one paragraph you
00:53:18.079 know and then I go to other companies
00:53:19.280 where they have a lawyer coming in
00:53:20.359 there's 80 Pages you know and it tells
00:53:22.400 what's happened joh which they get paid
00:53:23.799 at Severance so they end up going to
00:53:25.040 jail you know and I just I won't deal
00:53:27.559 with somebody that thinks that way uh
00:53:29.760 and you know that's fine there's a self-
00:53:31.520 selection process in terms of of who
00:53:33.640 comes to us there's this invisible
00:53:35.640 filter out there that causes the Clayton
00:53:38.559 of the world the AL Yoshis of the world
00:53:40.359 the ik Freemans of the world the Mrs be
00:53:42.040 e of the world to come to us when I made
00:53:44.000 the deal with Mrs B in
00:53:46.079 1983 Mrs B had another offer from
00:53:49.240 somebody else that was somewhat higher
00:53:50.720 and she just said I don't care she only
00:53:53.160 owned 20% of the company that she had
00:53:55.440 four children they
00:53:57.119 20% she told him you know I'm selling to
00:53:59.640 Mr Buffet she always called me Mr Buffet
00:54:01.839 up until when she was 104 uh and in fact
00:54:05.079 when I'd walk in the store she said here
00:54:06.240 comes my new Young boyfriend which I
00:54:08.000 didn't I I don't get that a lot of
00:54:09.839 places I can tell you the uh uh but she
00:54:13.960 you know she she built this thing she
00:54:17.000 came over here in 1921 or two she landed
00:54:20.559 in Seattle with a tag around her neck
00:54:22.280 she couldn't speak a word of English
00:54:24.760 said Fort Dodge Iowa she couldn't she
00:54:27.799 couldn't communicate she just had the
00:54:29.799 tag the American Red Cross got her out
00:54:32.319 to Fort Dodge and for two years she got
00:54:35.920 no place because nobody nobody spoke Uh
00:54:39.400 Russian and or or yish actually and and
00:54:42.280 so she moved onla just to be around some
00:54:44.839 other Russian Jews who she could at
00:54:46.920 least talk to she learned the English
00:54:49.480 language when her oldest daughter
00:54:51.720 Francis would go to school and come home
00:54:53.640 at night and teach her the words and she
00:54:56.040 started out and she started sending 50
00:54:57.640 bucks at a time over to Russia to bring
00:54:59.799 her siblings she had seven siblings and
00:55:01.760 her mother and father to get them over
00:55:03.440 here after 16 years she brought all the
00:55:06.839 family over she saved $500 in 16 years
00:55:10.000 you know pedling used clothing whatever
00:55:12.520 and she started in Raska furniture at
00:55:14.400 $500 and it's now the largest Home
00:55:16.480 Furnishings complex in the world and it
00:55:18.680 all came from the $500 and a very you
00:55:21.200 know special woman and can you
00:55:24.559 imagine building something I got in
00:55:26.760 selling it you know to some Financial
00:55:28.520 operator who's going to resell it you
00:55:29.799 know and try and go public with it a
00:55:31.400 couple of years later and it you know it
00:55:33.119 meant something to her she wanted it to
00:55:35.200 continue like it has continued and it's
00:55:38.920 that's those are the kind of people we
00:55:40.240 want to attract It Isn't So Much me
00:55:42.880 selecting them it's them selecting
00:55:44.880 Berkshire I mean that's that's the key
00:55:47.440 and and frankly we've gotten to that
00:55:49.559 position in this country where the
00:55:51.880 people that do care about their
00:55:53.000 businesses good size businesses there's
00:55:55.319 no second choice be besides Berkshire we
00:55:57.720 we get them you know they they come to
00:56:00.000 us we had a woman Doris Christopher come
00:56:02.200 to us last year Doris Christopher in
00:56:06.160 1980 had two little girls lived in
00:56:09.720 Chicago lived in a probably $20,000
00:56:13.839 house and she and her husband both work
00:56:17.559 she looking for something to do to make
00:56:20.599 a little extra money she thought about
00:56:22.799 catering and decided that would take her
00:56:24.760 away from the kids too much so she
00:56:26.960 decided that what she knew best though
00:56:28.520 was she'd been a home teacher she knew
00:56:31.319 cooking and uh and she knew the kitchen
00:56:34.200 and what was useful to people so she
00:56:36.240 borrowed $3,000 on her life insurance
00:56:38.319 policy That's All She had she went down
00:56:40.520 to the merchandise mart in Chicago and
00:56:42.720 said what's the least amount of this
00:56:44.119 utensil or that utensil manufacturer
00:56:45.880 would sell usually a
00:56:47.160 dozen and she took them home and then
00:56:50.599 she got the she had the idea that she
00:56:52.160 would hold these parties essentially in
00:56:54.799 people's homes and and so she arranged
00:56:56.920 with a woman in suburban Chicago to hold
00:56:58.920 the first party she almost turned back
00:57:01.280 she started driving there she thought of
00:57:02.760 to laugh at me and unlock the stuff over
00:57:04.480 and they won't buy you know what you do
00:57:06.599 she was very unsure of herself but she
00:57:08.720 went there she sold I think
00:57:11.240 $175 wor her Goods that
00:57:13.760 night uh she sold me her business last
00:57:16.920 year and uh that business business made
00:57:22.119 $140 million pre-taxed from this $3,000
00:57:25.559 investment
00:57:27.079 that woman had a passion for a business
00:57:28.880 and she understood her customer and she
00:57:30.280 loved her customer she loved the people
00:57:31.599 that worked with them she got
00:57:33.319 67,000 Associates it's called the
00:57:35.280 Pampered Chef some of you may have been
00:57:37.200 to a Pampered Chef party almost one
00:57:39.280 woman out of 10 in the United States
00:57:40.839 bought something from us last year and
00:57:43.839 uh now unfortunately I have to
00:57:46.599 acknowledge that she probably didn't
00:57:48.280 understand accounting that well but she
00:57:50.240 understood her customer and she
00:57:51.799 understood people and and and she likes
00:57:54.520 she likes people you know I I met her
00:57:56.640 one time but when she wanted to sell her
00:57:58.359 business there wasn't anybody else to
00:58:00.079 sell to as far as she was concerned she
00:58:01.559 just she came to Al mall we made a deal
00:58:03.599 in a few minutes uh we made it the
00:58:05.880 compensation deal took us you know 15
00:58:07.720 seconds she's running the business I've
00:58:09.720 never been there they're in Chico I hope
00:58:11.079 they're there
00:58:12.720 I we paid a lot of money for this I mean
00:58:15.400 someday we'll buy a business and
00:58:16.640 there'll just be some guy in a closet
00:58:18.000 some place saying you know what figure
00:58:19.119 should I send more in this month but but
00:58:22.079 uh I've never been there you know i'
00:58:23.640 I've met her and I've seen the results
00:58:25.480 of what she's done and she is in love
00:58:27.359 with the
00:58:28.920 company
00:58:30.799 yeah how do you inally value the buses
00:58:33.799 that acquires how do I value the
00:58:36.680 business as birkshire acquires well the
00:58:38.520 first thing I have to decide when
00:58:39.760 somebody calls me is is valuing this
00:58:42.920 business within my circle of competence
00:58:45.280 I don't know how to Value Microsoft I
00:58:46.760 don't know how to Value Oracle I mean if
00:58:48.400 you know Larry Ellison calls me or Bill
00:58:50.000 Gates calls me and they don't but if any
00:58:52.160 of those I don't know I or biotech or
00:58:55.039 anything I wouldn't know how to I just
00:58:56.920 you know I'd wish them well and tell
00:58:58.440 them you know I think it's worth twice
00:58:59.720 as much as they think it is but I'm just
00:59:01.000 not in the mood to buy today uh I I
00:59:04.319 don't know so it has to be within my
00:59:05.720 circle of competence my circle of
00:59:07.760 competence you know businesses I can
00:59:09.720 understand and when I say understand I
00:59:11.680 don't mean understand how to use a
00:59:12.839 computer and not use a computer in terms
00:59:14.319 of a computer company I mean understand
00:59:16.520 what the economic characteristics of the
00:59:18.440 business are and what the company is
00:59:20.160 really going to look like in five or 10
00:59:21.839 or 20 years Bill Gates will tell you
00:59:24.720 that that he re you know if if he were
00:59:26.839 investing he would buy Berkshire rather
00:59:28.760 than Microsoft because it's it's so much
00:59:31.079 easier to understand what our businesses
00:59:33.200 are going to look like whereas he's in a
00:59:34.480 business where you're going to really
00:59:35.400 have to be doing things differently over
00:59:36.960 time so I know that rley is going to be
00:59:39.760 the number one chewing gum in the
00:59:41.079 country I know sckers is going to be the
00:59:42.240 number one candy bar in the country 10
00:59:43.839 years from now it's been the number one
00:59:45.200 candy bar for 40 years you don't have to
00:59:47.680 be very bright to understand that when
00:59:49.920 people lay out 50 cents for something
00:59:52.000 that they stick in their mouth that
00:59:53.119 they're not about to experiment you know
00:59:54.680 I mean it's so
00:59:57.119 we we try to look at businesses we can
00:59:59.920 understand now I I got a call a year and
01:00:02.319 a half ago from a fellow I never heard
01:00:03.839 of him in Denver his name was Craig
01:00:06.039 ponzio Craig called me up and never
01:00:09.000 heard of him and he said I've got a
01:00:11.200 business this your kind of business and
01:00:14.079 I'm going to want I want to sell it
01:00:15.640 here's the reasons happen to be Happ to
01:00:18.160 do with health and although I don't pay
01:00:21.359 much attention to the reasons uh and he
01:00:24.280 said it's the leading Company by
01:00:27.520 far uh in the custom picture frame
01:00:32.000 business and he said let me tell you why
01:00:35.599 it has what I call durable competitive
01:00:37.520 advantage that's what I call durable
01:00:38.839 competitive Advantage he said let me
01:00:39.880 tell you why it has it he said there are
01:00:41.799 18,000 people that frame pictures in the
01:00:44.880 United States Little Mom and Pop
01:00:46.720 operations every time Lincoln will have
01:00:48.240 a half a dozen You Know M all have a
01:00:49.720 dozen or and they they frame pictures I
01:00:51.920 go over to get a picture framed I hand
01:00:53.359 it to somebody I say you I follow their
01:00:55.640 judge I say you know biggest thing I
01:00:57.520 want is I want a good-looking frame and
01:00:59.440 I want I want it back soon I want I want
01:01:01.839 quick delivery well with 18,000 people
01:01:04.760 in that business and a zillion kinds of
01:01:07.640 picture frames nobody can carry a big
01:01:09.240 inventory because they don't do that
01:01:10.280 much business I mean it's not Walmart or
01:01:11.960 something of the sort Craig ponzio
01:01:15.480 graduated from a little school up in
01:01:16.839 Wisconsin went to work in a tiny little
01:01:20.000 firm that made these things five or six
01:01:22.000 years later bought the place when it was
01:01:23.319 doing $3 million a year now does 300
01:01:25.599 million a year and it totally dominates
01:01:28.400 the wooden custom frame business why
01:01:31.240 does it dominate it it dominates it
01:01:33.640 because it calls on these 18,000 people
01:01:37.680 has a Salesforce calling on them six or
01:01:39.880 eight times a year and it has 22 plants
01:01:42.760 around the country that can get the
01:01:45.000 frame that the custom framer orders 85%
01:01:49.400 of the time if they order it by 5:00
01:01:51.079 today they'll have it by 3:00 tomorrow
01:01:52.799 afternoon now think of that coverage
01:01:54.880 that's what the customer wants they
01:01:56.240 don't care whether they pay $83 or $88
01:01:58.799 to get the thing frame they they you
01:02:00.640 know you've got something you want done
01:02:02.279 and you want it done fast and and that
01:02:03.760 little custom framer those 18,000 people
01:02:06.160 they want Happy customers and that means
01:02:08.079 speed of delivery and certainty and all
01:02:09.920 that you couldn't build a distribution
01:02:12.400 system to compete with us I mean you
01:02:14.640 know if just think of trying to build a
01:02:16.279 distribution system starting from
01:02:17.640 scratch that would take that business
01:02:19.480 away from us it can't be done well Craig
01:02:21.480 explained that to me in about 15 minutes
01:02:24.000 I never thought about the custom frame
01:02:25.319 business but I you know I framed
01:02:26.960 pictures or had people frame it for me
01:02:28.520 and IOD the the power of that uh that
01:02:32.400 was a
01:02:33.359 Monday uh I said I think we can make a
01:02:35.599 deal so he came on Wednesday he came at
01:02:38.440 9:00 and he left at 10:00 we've had a
01:02:40.240 deal and I've never seen him since you
01:02:41.640 know he got the money promptly
01:02:43.960 thereafter he wasn't going to come to
01:02:45.680 the annual meeting last year but his
01:02:46.839 wife was sick it'll probably come this
01:02:48.079 year he's a good guy and no one can
01:02:50.839 knock us off in that business every time
01:02:53.200 I buy a business I say to myself if I
01:02:55.480 had a billion dollars and I want to go
01:02:57.039 and compete with these guys could I
01:02:58.440 knock them off you know if you gave me a
01:03:00.960 billion dollars and you told me to
01:03:02.440 dislodge Snickers as the number one
01:03:04.319 candy bar in the country I don't know
01:03:05.599 how to do it if you tell me I got a
01:03:08.039 billion dollars and I got to make it or
01:03:09.640 five billion and I got to make it so
01:03:11.400 that WGY spearmint you know double mint
01:03:15.079 Juicy Fruit all of those get knocked off
01:03:16.799 the top selling gum list I can't do it
01:03:20.200 now if you give me you know if you give
01:03:22.720 me a billion dollars and tell me to
01:03:24.480 knock off all the ladies apparel shops
01:03:26.520 in Lincoln you know I'll make mince me
01:03:28.079 of them very fast I mean I have a very
01:03:29.960 good business myself but I can destroy
01:03:31.720 them and the real test is some you know
01:03:34.680 can some idiot with a lot of money
01:03:36.039 destroy the business you've got if he
01:03:37.799 decides to compete with you and we we
01:03:39.640 try to buy businesses where no matter
01:03:42.119 who comes along you know they've got
01:03:44.960 this durable competitive Advantage those
01:03:46.839 are the three words that count and you
01:03:49.480 could make that you may be able to make
01:03:51.319 that decision about companies that I
01:03:52.640 can't make that decision about they have
01:03:54.200 to be pretty simple for me but we buy
01:03:56.440 things that you know we have Fruit of
01:03:58.160 the Loom underwear you know are people
01:04:00.119 going to quit wearing underwear well who
01:04:03.160 knows but we we sell 44% of all the
01:04:06.680 men's and boys underwear uh that goes
01:04:09.480 through Walmart and all of the mass
01:04:12.000 merchandising chains we got the lowest
01:04:13.920 costs around FR of the Loom is a name
01:04:16.000 that's been around since 1850 or 60 you
01:04:18.599 know you if you can buy three pairs of
01:04:21.440 shorts from us or six pairs or whatever
01:04:23.400 is for 5 and A2 bucks and nobody's going
01:04:25.319 to sell them cheaper why are you going
01:04:27.559 to buy anything else you so we'll own
01:04:29.880 that unless we mess it up
01:04:32.119 somewh we've got a very potent
01:04:34.279 advertising U uh slogan there we cover
01:04:37.520 the asses of the masses
01:04:41.920 that's sort of gets to it doesn't it
01:04:45.279 yeah up
01:04:46.599 there yeah
01:04:55.760 St focus on four five year averages how
01:04:58.559 have you applied this philosophy to your
01:05:00.319 life and do you examine your successes
01:05:03.480 in your personal life based on could you
01:05:05.599 repeat that just a little louder I think
01:05:06.960 I got most of it but try me again okay
01:05:09.880 I'm going off your quote say um do not
01:05:12.799 take yearly results too seriously yeah
01:05:15.119 instead focus on four or five averages
01:05:17.480 how have you applied this philosophy to
01:05:19.119 your own life okay yeah the question is
01:05:20.960 since why don't since I say one or two
01:05:22.799 years doesn't make much difference in
01:05:23.920 business but longer term does how do I
01:05:25.920 play that in my life
01:05:27.319 well you I could probably give you some
01:05:29.480 terribly philosophical answer on it but
01:05:32.119 the truth is I get up every day and just
01:05:33.480 do what I love doing and and uh you know
01:05:37.240 I
01:05:38.359 want people around me to have good
01:05:41.279 experiences but you know I I the truth
01:05:44.680 is I don't spend most of my time
01:05:45.720 thinking about that I mean I I really I
01:05:47.480 spend most of my time thinking about
01:05:49.880 what can I do to keep Berkshire going
01:05:52.760 the way it has going but I will tell you
01:05:54.640 how to apply that and and it works
01:05:57.279 reasonably well I think at Berkshire
01:05:59.119 because we get this self- selection of
01:06:01.359 people to join it I mean we have created
01:06:02.920 a working environment where in 38 years
01:06:04.920 nobody's left that runs it so I you know
01:06:07.039 I do feel good about that obviously I
01:06:08.799 feel good about the results of the
01:06:10.039 investors and you know the offers and
01:06:12.079 those people I mean actually I think a
01:06:14.240 fellow May write a book about what's
01:06:16.359 happened with all the money that all
01:06:17.680 these different people have made in
01:06:19.319 burer but I'll tell you the test on that
01:06:21.640 and and it's a terrific
01:06:23.520 question because you will when you get
01:06:26.440 to my age you will not measure how well
01:06:28.720 you've done by how much money you've got
01:06:30.000 I can guarantee you that you you'll all
01:06:31.680 do fine on money anyway I mean uh you
01:06:34.640 know think about it 7 hours a day you
01:06:37.559 know you're in a bed you got exactly the
01:06:40.480 same mattress I've got if you don't
01:06:41.880 we'll sell it to you at the furniture
01:06:43.000 mark you know I mean so so that I me
01:06:45.359 we're on a parody I can't I can't outdo
01:06:47.200 you you know in terms of my sleeping
01:06:48.720 enjoyment you can you can match it by by
01:06:51.000 buying this mattress which will give you
01:06:52.720 a special price on just mentioned my
01:06:54.200 name H
01:06:56.319 we eat at the same places you know we
01:06:58.240 eat at Dairy Queen particularly if
01:06:59.599 you're in my position because we own it
01:07:01.400 but but we eat at McDonald's and Burger
01:07:03.400 King and and when I leave here I'll stop
01:07:05.480 by a fast food place and so our eating
01:07:07.359 experiences are the same we travel the
01:07:09.960 same I mean I had a 10-year-old car up
01:07:11.760 till about a year ago you know and it
01:07:13.559 just doesn't make any difference to me
01:07:15.039 they they all work we live in a place
01:07:17.279 that's warm in the winter and it's cool
01:07:18.760 in the summer and we watch the Super
01:07:20.039 Bowl on big screen TV you do it I do it
01:07:22.599 you know we dress more or less the same
01:07:24.160 I mean I pay more for my clothes but
01:07:25.640 they look cheap when I put them on so
01:07:27.200 we're really on a we're on a parody yeah
01:07:30.039 so so the money isn't going to be that
01:07:32.039 big a deal everybody in this country is
01:07:33.680 going to you know that with the
01:07:35.279 intelligence this group has the energy
01:07:37.200 you have you're going to do well so
01:07:39.400 what's the difference you know what
01:07:41.240 really counts well I would say that you
01:07:44.720 will measure health is enormously
01:07:46.880 important and that's a matter of a fair
01:07:48.160 amount of luck I mean you know so I
01:07:50.119 won't I I don't want I'm not short
01:07:51.599 changing it I'm just saying you can't do
01:07:53.440 too much about that but
01:07:56.400 you will measure your success in life by
01:07:59.359 whether by how many and extent whether
01:08:02.640 it's the people you
01:08:04.240 want at 70 or whatever the age may be
01:08:07.920 you'll measure by how many of them
01:08:09.039 really love you you know in the end I
01:08:11.359 mean you can't you know you you can't
01:08:14.760 buy love I mean it doesn't work you can
01:08:16.319 buy sex you can buy testimonial dinners
01:08:18.319 you can buy your name on buildings you
01:08:19.560 can do all kinds of things but the you
01:08:21.520 know the only way you get to be you know
01:08:23.158 love is to be lovable it's kind of
01:08:25.000 irritating actually if you got a lot of
01:08:26.198 money it'd be more fun to just write out
01:08:27.399 the check for a million dollars
01:08:29.279 everybody you know from now on loves me
01:08:30.960 but it doesn't work that way and in fact
01:08:33.679 it it the only way is to be is to be
01:08:35.560 lovable and and you know I've got this
01:08:37.319 friend who uh who came out of woodz and
01:08:41.640 had a at least one member of the family
01:08:43.399 die there and what is it now it's uh 60
01:08:49.198 years later you know she still when she
01:08:53.080 looks at people it's a polish jew when
01:08:55.640 she looks at people the question she
01:08:58.359 asks herself in determining who she
01:09:00.880 really trusts as friends the one
01:09:03.120 question in her mind is would they hide
01:09:06.279 me now when you get to be 70 if you got
01:09:09.759 a lot of people that would hide you
01:09:11.759 you've had a successful life I know
01:09:14.080 people who have a tremendous amount of
01:09:15.560 money no one would hide their own kids
01:09:18.238 wouldn't hide them I mean they they
01:09:20.080 really wouldn't I mean their business
01:09:21.238 associates wouldn't or anybody else if
01:09:22.719 it really came down to it you know they
01:09:25.719 they don't have anybody's respect
01:09:27.799 they've got their attention maybe with
01:09:29.238 money or something of the sort but they
01:09:31.040 they nobody loves them and uh my friend
01:09:34.560 Tom Murphy at campus City Stevie I mean
01:09:37.080 dozens of people would hide murf you
01:09:38.719 know all kinds of people with but I had
01:09:41.759 my wife you
01:09:43.319 know uh Ben Graham A lot of people would
01:09:45.839 have my dad would have had a number and
01:09:48.399 then like I say that I can I can tell
01:09:50.120 you people that uh you know everybody
01:09:53.600 May pay homage to him and the kids may
01:09:55.920 put up with them and hope they don't
01:09:56.960 change their will or something but the
01:09:58.600 truth is that nobody would hide them and
01:10:00.640 if you've got a lot of people that would
01:10:01.920 hide you when you get to be
01:10:04.760 70 uh you will had a very successful
01:10:09.679 life okay right in front um throughout
01:10:13.239 your life what are some of the your
01:10:15.400 personal and career goals that you've
01:10:17.520 set for yourself and um have which ones
01:10:21.000 have you accomplished and which ones are
01:10:22.199 you still um going after yeah just in
01:10:25.600 terms of personal goals or or just goals
01:10:28.480 that you've set through your life that
01:10:29.719 you've accomplished yeah well I would
01:10:31.960 you know the truth is the main goal I've
01:10:33.719 had has been at Berkshire I mean you
01:10:35.960 know it might be more admirable to say
01:10:37.640 then I was feeding the poor or something
01:10:39.480 someplace in India but it it it isn't
01:10:41.080 true I mean it it's it it's been the
01:10:43.960 focus of my life most of the time the
01:10:47.080 money will be I think used for very good
01:10:50.199 purposes later on I I don't use any real
01:10:52.679 amount of it myself but actually
01:10:54.440 somebody else is going to do most of
01:10:55.800 that and and I pick good people to do it
01:10:58.800 uh but you know I I've got three kids of
01:11:03.400 which I'm enormously proud and they and
01:11:06.159 they like each other they get you know
01:11:07.800 they they do things together they work
01:11:09.440 you know the the family unit works
01:11:12.040 extremely well but my wife gets 99.99%
01:11:15.560 of the credit for that I mean if you
01:11:17.000 didn't turn out well under her there's
01:11:18.360 something really wrong with you uh and
01:11:21.239 uh it's you know it it's uh uh
01:11:26.000 uh it's a life that's a lot of fun but
01:11:29.880 it's I do what I enjoy doing you know it
01:11:33.040 it uh I I play lots of bridge on the
01:11:36.320 internet because I you know I like to do
01:11:38.719 that more than anything else I used to
01:11:40.280 do way more reading I do a lot of
01:11:41.600 reading but I I used to just read all
01:11:43.440 the time now I spend 12 hours a week on
01:11:45.760 the internet playing bridge and I you
01:11:48.080 know it's it's great I I will talk to
01:11:50.760 the Microsoft Summit here in about a
01:11:52.440 month and I tell this group there's all
01:11:54.520 these high powerered internet types and
01:11:55.840 I tell them look at you know you guys
01:11:57.480 are all failures because here I am got
01:12:00.679 all kinds of money you know I've been
01:12:03.199 fooling around with the internet now for
01:12:04.520 10 or 12 years I spend 12 or 14 hours a
01:12:07.600 week on it mostly bridge but I do you
01:12:09.719 know the Google searches and [ __ ]
01:12:11.520 writing a talk I look up all kind of all
01:12:13.679 kinds of information on it you know I
01:12:15.960 read the New York Times The Wall Street
01:12:17.560 Journal 10:00 the night before and all
01:12:19.600 these things and you guys are getting
01:12:21.480 exactly 120 bucks a year out of me I
01:12:24.360 mean that is a failure I they have not
01:12:26.600 figured out how to get any money out of
01:12:27.880 me and and I I gave them this talk last
01:12:30.080 year and this year I'm going to go back
01:12:31.560 there and say you've made no progress at
01:12:32.960 all you
01:12:34.080 know it's 120 bucks last year it's 120
01:12:37.000 bucks this year and in between I've had
01:12:38.480 600 hours of enjoyment and learned all
01:12:40.400 kinds of things uh so I I I do enjoy you
01:12:44.120 know that I enjoy that more than
01:12:45.560 anything now when I was young I thought
01:12:46.800 I had a lot of money I you know I I'd
01:12:48.239 own a professional sports team and I
01:12:50.560 play golf all the time maybe have my own
01:12:52.120 private golf course and all kinds of
01:12:53.600 things just doesn't mean to me you know
01:12:56.199 I I I I have
01:12:59.440 something where 365 days a year
01:13:03.320 everything is good I work around
01:13:04.639 terrific people one was here today that
01:13:06.400 came with me that broke me down and and
01:13:08.360 I mean I get to select the people I work
01:13:10.360 with that's a huge huge luxury I mean
01:13:13.159 literally just think of if you had to
01:13:14.800 work for a boss you couldn't stand you
01:13:16.280 know or work around people because your
01:13:17.880 stomach to churn it's just what I mean
01:13:19.920 it'd be miserable so the ultimate luxury
01:13:21.920 really is doing something every day that
01:13:23.360 you love doing with people which you
01:13:25.360 love doing it with and and I've got that
01:13:27.880 and uh you know by accident to some
01:13:30.440 extent I say if you if you if you take
01:13:33.719 on a job just to make a lot of money and
01:13:36.440 it caus your stomach to churn you know
01:13:37.800 and you go home at night and kick the
01:13:38.920 dog and all that sort of thing you know
01:13:40.840 that that's a little bit like marrying
01:13:42.400 for money you know it's it's probably a
01:13:44.800 bad idea under any circumstances but if
01:13:47.280 you're already rich it's crazy right I
01:13:49.239 mean if I marry for money I mean I have
01:13:51.639 my head examined what's it going to do
01:13:54.239 you know and so it it's you know it's it
01:13:58.000 is and we're lucky in this country I
01:13:59.800 mean we won what I call the ovarian
01:14:01.639 Lottery when we were born in this
01:14:02.840 country you know was four times or
01:14:05.560 likely you would have been born in China
01:14:06.840 just about as likely You' been born in
01:14:08.120 Bangladesh you know you're born in the
01:14:09.960 greatest Society in the world so make
01:14:12.000 the most of it and have a good
01:14:14.760 time let's see who's had okay up there
01:14:17.639 you two guys are next to each other you
01:14:18.760 can fight it
01:14:19.920 out what whether it be professionally or
01:14:23.520 personally you and
01:14:25.600 in Omaha stbr well yeah that's a good
01:14:28.239 question why do I stay in Omaha well I
01:14:30.199 love it and uh you know my my
01:14:33.719 grandfather went to Central High my dad
01:14:36.000 went there my wife went there my kids
01:14:38.600 went there and now my grandchildren are
01:14:40.120 there they they all my grandchildren say
01:14:42.480 they they have the same teacher that my
01:14:43.920 grandfather
01:14:45.320 had they uh but there's continuity
01:14:49.520 there's friends there all kinds of
01:14:51.440 things I mean there's no disadvantage to
01:14:53.239 being an Alo I mean I like it New York
01:14:55.440 when I'm there I've got a house in
01:14:56.600 California you know and I I get around
01:14:59.360 some but I can't imagine anything better
01:15:03.040 I mean I you know what what doesn't it
01:15:06.360 have I have a home I've never sold a
01:15:09.120 house in my life I have a home I'm moved
01:15:12.440 into a 1958 I've been there what 45
01:15:14.719 years or so I'm 5 minutes from the
01:15:17.719 office I moved into the office in 1962
01:15:19.840 I've been in there 41 years we've just
01:15:21.760 gotten so we Tak we take a whole floor
01:15:24.199 second there 4 one years to where we can
01:15:25.840 use a whole floor kind of discouraging
01:15:28.600 uh but there there I am 5 minutes from
01:15:30.679 the off everything's easy and it all
01:15:32.960 works I know all my you know I've known
01:15:34.600 the doctors all my life I've known
01:15:36.080 everybody at uh uh I feel
01:15:39.400 connected and my aunt taught in the
01:15:41.880 public school system in Omaha I've named
01:15:44.360 a
01:15:45.560 scholar prize that I give after her but
01:15:48.000 I mean it all means something and I've
01:15:50.639 lived in New York for a couple of years
01:15:52.400 I lived in Washington DC for some years
01:15:54.520 I never felt that kind of connection at
01:15:56.080 all so and there is absolutely no
01:15:58.159 disadvantage you at the uh you know I
01:16:02.280 get the same information actually with
01:16:04.199 the with the internet and you know
01:16:06.440 Bloomberg and all that I no one can get
01:16:08.639 any information any faster than than I
01:16:10.679 can get it and uh there's just no
01:16:13.320 downside and I think it's been a
01:16:15.320 terrific environment for my kids to grow
01:16:17.360 up in I mean my kids have grown up in a
01:16:20.320 neighborhood perfectly normal
01:16:21.760 neighborhood I mean you know no fences
01:16:23.199 around it no you know no golden ghettos
01:16:25.719 or anything of the sort they've gone to
01:16:27.480 an integrated Public School school has
01:16:30.719 probably had between 20 and 30% black
01:16:32.520 students for 75 years they have great
01:16:34.840 teachers you know I mean I I I think
01:16:37.239 that you know part of education is a
01:16:38.920 total life experience and uh I think
01:16:42.199 it's great that we have a good public
01:16:43.639 school system in Alo I if if I lived in
01:16:45.880 Washington or Los Angeles or New York
01:16:47.800 I'd have to send my kids to private
01:16:49.280 school I wouldn't want to do that uh i'
01:16:51.440 do it because I wouldn't send him to a
01:16:53.560 bash inferior School
01:16:55.600 just to prove some point so but the nice
01:16:58.360 thing about is I haven't had to make
01:16:59.440 that choice no more I've got classy
01:17:01.159 Public Schools the same kind I went to
01:17:03.159 you know 50 or 60 years ago and they get
01:17:06.120 more out of that experience in my view
01:17:08.120 they have a better balanced view of life
01:17:10.320 going through that experience than you
01:17:12.120 know if I sent them off to some private
01:17:14.560 school I was with actually last week a
01:17:18.199 uh there were six couples um Bill and
01:17:21.400 Melinda Gates arranged it and and they
01:17:23.880 had the Headmaster of a private school
01:17:25.960 in Seattle that that bill went to and
01:17:28.520 it's a classy school but you know if
01:17:32.080 you're I gather from the in terms of the
01:17:34.719 public school system that you're making
01:17:37.080 a conscious decision to hurt your kid if
01:17:39.159 you don't send them to a private school
01:17:40.600 if you can afford one you know and
01:17:42.400 that's why these people do it and I
01:17:44.120 don't blame them I mean I do the same
01:17:45.719 thing but the nice thing about it is
01:17:47.760 that alahan I'm sure Lincoln as well and
01:17:50.679 throughout Nebraska we have kept a good
01:17:53.159 public school system and frankly I think
01:17:54.600 that's one of the most important things
01:17:56.480 in America because one of the things
01:17:59.040 made has made America what it is think
01:18:00.560 think about it
01:18:02.760 1776 3 million people in America 300
01:18:06.199 million people in China they had 100
01:18:08.560 times as many people they had the same
01:18:10.480 IQs we had you know they had the same
01:18:12.800 physical abilities and all that sort of
01:18:15.080 thing they had a culture that went far
01:18:16.600 back they had lots of Natural Resources
01:18:18.320 we didn't know about it then because we
01:18:19.840 didn't have oil and they didn't have oil
01:18:21.199 but we both had oil in the end coal all
01:18:23.520 these things you
01:18:25.560 lot educational institutions that far
01:18:27.880 surpassed ours at the time and now we
01:18:30.440 end up you know 20 30 years later we end
01:18:34.360 up with I don't know 36 or 7% of the
01:18:36.840 world's GDP you know from those three
01:18:39.280 million people something about the
01:18:40.840 system really works and I think one of
01:18:42.560 the things that works about it is is we
01:18:44.360 come closer to equality of opportunity
01:18:47.239 than any major country in the world but
01:18:50.679 the one of the keys to having equal
01:18:52.760 opportunity is a good public school
01:18:54.480 system
01:18:55.440 you know if you have one public school
01:18:56.920 system for the rich and one for the poor
01:18:59.000 you do not have equality of opportunity
