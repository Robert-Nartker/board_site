00:00:00.299 investing is not that
00:00:02.340 is really not complicated I mean the
00:00:04.680 the basic framework for it
00:00:07.560 is simple now then you you have to work
00:00:10.200 at it some to find the best pockets of
00:00:13.380 of uh undervaluation maybe or something
00:00:16.740 but
00:00:18.180 you didn't have to have a
00:00:20.580 you didn't have to have a high IQ you
00:00:22.439 didn't have to have lots of investment
00:00:23.939 smarts to buy junk Bonds in 2002 or even
00:00:28.320 to do some of the stuff that was
00:00:29.519 available when ltcm got in trouble you
00:00:32.460 really just had to have
00:00:34.320 sort of the courage of your convictions
00:00:36.000 you had to have the willingness to do
00:00:38.340 something when everybody else was
00:00:39.540 petrified
00:00:40.739 and but that was true in 1974 when you
00:00:44.520 know we were buying stocks at very very
00:00:46.260 very low multiples of earnings it wasn't
00:00:48.180 that anybody didn't
00:00:49.739 didn't know that they were cheap they
00:00:52.079 were just paralyzed for one reason or
00:00:53.760 another and and
00:00:56.039 you know that
00:00:58.140 the lesson
00:01:00.120 a following
00:01:02.160 logic rather than emotion you know is
00:01:04.920 something that
00:01:06.180 it's obvious and some people have great
00:01:08.100 trouble with it and others have less
00:01:09.720 trouble
00:01:11.880 Charlie can you give him any more help
00:01:13.439 from there
00:01:15.479 well I think this is different when we
00:01:17.700 were young
00:01:19.320 we had
00:01:20.880 way less competition than you people
00:01:23.520 have now
00:01:25.619 there weren't very many smart people
00:01:28.200 in the Investment Management Field
00:01:30.900 they really weren't and
00:01:35.159 you should have seen the people who were
00:01:36.600 in The Bank Trust departments I mean
00:01:39.360 so
00:01:41.220 now we've got
00:01:42.900 armies of brilliant young people and all
00:01:45.299 these private Partnerships and all these
00:01:47.759 proprietary desks and all the big
00:01:50.479 investment Banks it's a and we've got a
00:01:53.700 vast amount of talented in the
00:01:55.200 investment management business so and
00:01:58.380 there's a lot of competition there were
00:02:00.119 suddenly a crisis now
00:02:03.119 there would be
00:02:05.159 500 firms that would be studying it
00:02:07.380 intensely each having Capital that they
00:02:10.619 could commit on a hair trigger
00:02:12.720 in our day we
00:02:14.940 would frequently be all alone but in
00:02:17.520 2000 would be the only we'd be the only
00:02:19.620 buyer but in 2002 Charlie there were
00:02:21.900 tons of people that had investment
00:02:23.760 experience and high IQs and lots of
00:02:26.280 money was around one main question about
00:02:27.540 money it's just they were terrified of
00:02:29.040 that particular Arena well when you have
00:02:31.080 it
00:02:32.220 huge convulsion
00:02:34.739 which is like
00:02:36.720 a big fire in this Auditorium right now
00:02:40.200 you know we get a lot of weird behavior
00:02:42.599 and if you
00:02:45.599 and if you can particularly if they had
00:02:47.400 table
00:02:50.640 and if you can be
00:02:52.920 wise when everybody else is going crazy
00:02:56.340 sure there will still be opportunities
00:02:58.860 but that may give you a long dull
00:03:00.720 stretches if that's your strategy
00:03:03.239 three years ago two three years ago you
00:03:06.840 could find a number of Securities and
00:03:09.000 Korea population 50 million advanced
00:03:12.060 Society
00:03:13.860 strong balance sheets
00:03:15.959 strong industry positions at three or so
00:03:18.959 times earnings now but that took a
00:03:21.959 convulsion to create that a real a big
00:03:24.480 convulsive yeah but the convulsion
00:03:25.860 happened three or four years earlier
00:03:27.000 five years earlier and
00:03:29.340 plenty of smart people in Korea in the
00:03:31.379 investment business plenty of smart
00:03:33.239 people here scouring the information was
00:03:35.819 all available you you you can you can go
00:03:38.760 to the Internet and get information
00:03:40.019 about Korean companies as just as good
00:03:42.060 as you get up from the SEC
00:03:43.860 and there they were dozens of companies
00:03:46.440 that very very very cheap prices now
00:03:48.840 we're all these smart people and with
00:03:51.599 all this money it did happen but I asked
00:03:54.540 you to name 20 more like it you would
00:03:56.340 have great difficulty
00:03:59.700 I'm gonna name them
00:04:02.360 number eight
00:04:06.540 my name's Simon Dennison Smith from the
00:04:09.120 UK
00:04:10.080 my question is this
00:04:11.819 if you were starting out today with a
00:04:14.519 million dollars with a vision of
00:04:16.260 building a business
00:04:17.760 with 20 average growth in value over 40
00:04:21.120 years
00:04:22.139 what type of Investments and investment
00:04:24.900 strategy would you look to make in the
00:04:28.080 first five years
00:04:31.860 interesting that
00:04:33.720 perform the first partnership
00:04:36.000 50 years ago last two days ago Thursday
00:04:38.580 on May 4th
00:04:41.720 1956 which was 105 000. um
00:04:46.500 that's my sister clapping she would she
00:04:48.780 was in the partnership
00:04:52.259 they
00:04:54.540 would
00:04:56.580 Charlie and I were starting all over
00:04:58.380 again and we were in this Charlie would
00:05:00.540 say we shouldn't be doing this but but
00:05:02.580 uh
00:05:04.020 but if we if we were to succumb to Satan
00:05:06.900 and engage in same kind of activity
00:05:10.199 we would I think be doing
00:05:13.440 something very similarly if we are
00:05:15.180 investing in securities
00:05:17.040 we would look around the world and we
00:05:19.380 would look at a Korean and Charlie says
00:05:21.479 you can't find 20 of them but you don't
00:05:22.919 have to find 20 of them you only have to
00:05:24.479 find you only have to find one really
00:05:28.139 you do not have to have tons of good
00:05:29.820 ideas in this business you just have
00:05:32.160 a good idea that's worth a ton
00:05:33.900 occasionally and
00:05:35.400 insecurities we would
00:05:37.500 we would be doing the same thing which
00:05:39.120 would probably mean smaller stocks it
00:05:41.100 would mean smaller stocks
00:05:43.500 because we would find things that could
00:05:45.060 have an impact
00:05:46.560 on a small portfolio that will have no
00:05:48.840 impact on a portfolio the size of
00:05:50.580 Berkshire
00:05:51.840 uh if we were trying to buy businesses
00:05:53.580 we'd have a tough time
00:05:56.100 um we would have no reputation
00:05:58.100 so people would not be coming to us
00:06:01.080 we'd be too small a player if you're
00:06:03.300 talking about a million dollars so we
00:06:04.800 would not have much
00:06:06.479 success I don't think with small amounts
00:06:08.639 buying businesses Charlie started out
00:06:11.039 you know in real estate development
00:06:12.720 because it took very very little capital
00:06:14.539 and you could magnify brain power and
00:06:17.400 energy uh
00:06:19.560 uh or I should say brain power and
00:06:22.080 energy could magnify some small amounts
00:06:24.060 of capital in a huge way that was not
00:06:26.639 true in securities
00:06:28.560 um
00:06:29.699 Financial inclination was to look at
00:06:31.380 Securities and and just kind of do it
00:06:34.560 one
00:06:35.819 foot in front of the other over time
00:06:38.940 but
00:06:41.759 the basic principles wouldn't be
00:06:43.319 different uh
00:06:45.600 you know I think if I'd been running a
00:06:47.280 partnership a couple of years ago with a
00:06:49.440 small amount of money I think I'd have
00:06:50.759 probably been 100 in Korea
00:06:52.860 and uh
00:06:54.840 you know I would be looking around
00:06:57.720 for something that was
00:06:59.940 very mispriced and which and and that I
00:07:03.060 understood
00:07:04.500 and every now and then that's going to
00:07:06.360 happen Charlie
00:07:09.539 well I agree with that
00:07:12.660 the concept that you're likely to find
00:07:15.240 just one thing where it'll make twenty
00:07:17.160 percent per annum and you just sit back
00:07:18.780 for the next 40 years
00:07:22.680 that tends to be Dreamland
00:07:25.860 and
00:07:27.300 in the real world you you have to find
00:07:30.240 something
00:07:31.560 that you can understand that's the best
00:07:34.259 you have available
00:07:36.300 and uh and once you found the best thing
00:07:40.139 then you measure everything against that
00:07:42.240 because it's your opportunity cost
00:07:45.000 that's the way small sums of money
00:07:47.400 should be invested
00:07:49.139 and the trick of course is
00:07:51.360 is getting enough expertise that your
00:07:54.180 opportunity cost
00:07:55.740 meaning your default option which is
00:07:57.960 still pretty good is very high
00:08:01.500 and
00:08:03.240 so the game hasn't changed at all in
00:08:05.819 terms of its basic arithmetic that's why
00:08:08.220 modern portfolio theory is so asinine
00:08:13.440 it really is folks yeah when Warren said
00:08:17.520 he would have been all in one country
00:08:22.520 that's pretty close to
00:08:25.259 close to right he wouldn't have quite
00:08:26.879 done that when he had the partnership
00:08:28.280 but he would have been way more
00:08:30.960 concentrated than is conventional if you
00:08:34.020 listen to Modern portfolio Theory most
00:08:36.659 people aren't going to find thousands of
00:08:38.760 things that are equally good
00:08:40.860 they're going to find a few things where
00:08:43.500 one or two of them are way better than
00:08:45.060 anything else they know
00:08:46.620 and the right way to
00:08:49.140 think about it and investing is to
00:08:52.320 Act
00:08:53.519 thinking about your best opportunity
00:08:55.260 cost
00:08:57.899 number nine
00:08:59.820 that's in the Freshman course in
00:09:02.220 economics everywhere in the basic
00:09:05.459 textbook it just had it hasn't made its
00:09:07.680 way into modern portfolio Theory
00:09:13.080 we don't get asked to do book reviews
00:09:17.580 it's it's Andreas Viga from Munich
00:09:20.640 Germany thank you very much for the open
00:09:23.459 discussion that you have with us
00:09:25.100 actually I'd like to ask a question on a
00:09:28.860 book so I come back to the book review
00:09:31.800 um Jeremy Siegel had some ideas in his
00:09:34.620 second book and I would like to
00:09:36.899 understand what how this would impact
00:09:40.019 your investment strategies if there are
00:09:43.620 any changes from his ideas
00:09:46.740 and how you react to these
00:09:50.220 recommendations that he makes thank you
00:09:52.500 this is which book Jeremy sprinkle
00:09:54.660 Jeremy Siegel the second book by the try
00:09:58.260 and the true triumph over the world and
00:10:00.480 the new now that it's had no effect on
00:10:02.820 on us Charlie
00:10:05.220 no is that the fellow who's very
00:10:07.140 optimistic about common stock investment
00:10:09.480 over long periods of time the University
00:10:11.160 of Pennsylvania yeah
00:10:12.839 yeah
00:10:14.100 well I think he's demented
00:10:18.060 well
00:10:21.839 he's a he's a very nice guy Charlie well
00:10:28.140 he he may well be a very nice guy but
00:10:32.880 he's comparing apples against elephants
00:10:35.700 and trying to make
00:10:37.620 accurate projections
00:10:46.380 number 10.
00:10:51.600 I'm Bob Klein from Los Angeles you've so
00:10:55.140 eloquently stated that you can't see
00:10:57.540 who's swimming naked until the tide goes
00:10:59.880 out
00:11:00.839 could you discuss the issue of trying to
00:11:03.480 employ a rational decision-making
00:11:05.339 process in investing or in business
00:11:08.339 generally as opposed to focusing on
00:11:11.220 outcomes or results of just a few
00:11:13.860 instances or over a short period of time
00:11:16.980 for example it may not be a good idea to
00:11:20.459 underwrite some insurance policies if
00:11:23.100 competition is lowered the premiums too
00:11:25.380 far and likewise in the stock market
00:11:27.860 momentum investors may get good results
00:11:30.779 for a while but buying high and trying
00:11:34.200 to sell higher isn't a good long-term
00:11:36.480 strategy so I'd just like to hear you
00:11:38.820 guys provide some detail on the
00:11:40.740 importance of using an effective
00:11:42.600 decision-making process even though it
00:11:45.240 may lead to some bad outcomes and
00:11:47.760 underperformance in the short run
00:11:50.220 yeah well Ben Graham said long ago that
00:11:52.500 you're neither right nor wrong because
00:11:54.360 people agree with you or disagree with
00:11:56.940 you in other words being being
00:11:58.320 contrarian has no
00:12:00.060 special virtue over being a trend
00:12:02.399 follower a
00:12:04.680 you're right
00:12:05.880 because your facts and reasoning are
00:12:07.500 right so all you do
00:12:09.779 is you try to make sure
00:12:12.000 that the facts you have are correct and
00:12:13.860 that's usually pretty easy to do in this
00:12:16.019 country I mean the information is
00:12:17.640 available on all kinds of things
00:12:19.019 internet makes it even easier
00:12:21.420 and then once you have the facts you got
00:12:24.060 to think through what they mean and you
00:12:26.279 don't take a public opinion survey you
00:12:28.500 don't pay attention
00:12:29.820 to things that are unimportant I mean
00:12:32.279 what you're looking for is something
00:12:33.540 things that are important and knowable
00:12:35.399 if something's important but unknowable
00:12:37.680 forget it I mean it may be important
00:12:40.019 in order to know whether somebody's
00:12:41.459 going to drop a nuclear weapon tomorrow
00:12:43.380 but it's unknowable it may be all kinds
00:12:46.680 of things but so you fo and and there
00:12:48.839 are all kinds of things that are
00:12:49.800 knowable but are unimportant in focusing
00:12:52.260 on business and investment decisions
00:12:54.779 you try to think you narrow it down to
00:12:57.060 the things that are knowable and
00:12:58.920 important and then you decide whether
00:13:00.839 you have information of sufficient value
00:13:04.440 that you know compared to price and all
00:13:06.420 that that will cause you to act what
00:13:08.519 others are doing
00:13:10.680 means nothing it Thrice and all that it
00:13:13.079 will cause you to act what others are
00:13:15.000 doing
00:13:16.680 means nothing it's what Graham writes in
00:13:19.380 chapter eight of the intelligent
00:13:20.579 investor that the market is there to
00:13:22.260 serve you and not to instruct you that's
00:13:24.720 of enormous importance when people talk
00:13:26.100 about momentum in stocks or or charting
00:13:28.860 or any kind of things like that they're
00:13:30.000 saying that the market is instructing
00:13:31.620 you the market doesn't instruct us
00:13:34.380 the market is there to serve us if it
00:13:36.779 does something silly we get a chance to
00:13:39.600 do something because it's doing
00:13:40.620 something silly we do it but it doesn't
00:13:42.420 tell us anything it just tells us prices
00:13:45.600 and the price is out of line where the
00:13:47.639 facts and reasoning lead you then you
00:13:50.940 then action is called for and if it
00:13:53.339 doesn't you forget it and you know
00:13:55.500 go play bridge that day and the next day
00:13:57.480 see whether there's something new and
00:13:58.920 the nice thing about it is there always
00:14:00.120 is something new I mentioned the ltcm
00:14:03.420 crisis
00:14:04.500 you know we
00:14:05.700 on Sunday
00:14:07.500 from for people that had portfolios that
00:14:10.320 were in trouble
00:14:11.519 now I will tell you
00:14:13.740 that if you can make a lot of money on
00:14:16.800 Sunday you may not get a chance very
00:14:18.120 often but any calls you get on Sunday
00:14:19.440 you're probably going to make money on
00:14:20.899 things you're things are really screwed
00:14:23.459 up if you're getting calls on Sunday and
00:14:25.560 all you have to do
00:14:27.720 is make sure that you're the collie and
00:14:30.000 not the caller on Sunday
00:14:33.420 and
00:14:34.680 but if you get those calls you get a
00:14:36.480 call on a Sunday and somebody says that
00:14:37.920 the off the run is trading 30 basis
00:14:39.540 points away from the on the Run
00:14:41.279 you know all you have to do is decide
00:14:44.639 whether how you handle that particular
00:14:47.100 piece of information whether it's
00:14:48.660 correct in the first place but how you
00:14:50.339 handle that piece of information
00:14:52.260 whether you can play out your hand you
00:14:54.180 never get in a position
00:14:55.560 obviously where the other fellow can
00:14:57.540 call your tune you have to be able to
00:15:00.120 play out your hand under all
00:15:01.500 circumstances
00:15:02.639 but if you can play out your hand and
00:15:05.160 you've got the right facts and you
00:15:07.079 Reason by yourself and you let the
00:15:09.540 market serve you and not instruct you
00:15:11.459 you can't miss Charlie
00:15:15.540 well I would say some of you probably
00:15:17.579 can miss
00:15:20.160 okay
00:15:23.160 I would say Charlie can't miss I'll put
00:15:25.019 it that way he'll agree with that
00:15:29.760 do you have anything further Ado okay
00:15:35.160 at least I've got them off that previous
00:15:36.600 subject number 11.
00:15:39.480 it really doesn't make any difference I
00:15:41.220 mean what what we don't pay any
00:15:43.139 attention to what what people say about
00:15:45.079 Coca-Cola stock or Gillette stock or any
00:15:48.420 of those things I mean
00:15:49.740 on any given day two million shares of
00:15:52.199 Coca-Cola May trade that's a lot of
00:15:54.480 people selling a lot of people buying it
00:15:56.040 if you will talk to one person you'd
00:15:57.660 hear one thing and talk to another it
00:15:59.279 really you really should not make
00:16:00.660 decisions and securities based on what
00:16:02.579 other people think if you're if you're
00:16:03.720 doing that
00:16:04.920 uh you should you should think about
00:16:06.720 doing something else because
00:16:08.639 it's a public opinion of poll will just
00:16:11.699 it will not get you rich in Wall Street
00:16:13.380 uh uh so you really want to stick with
00:16:15.720 businesses that you feel you can
00:16:17.880 somehow evaluate evaluate yourself
00:16:21.180 and uh
00:16:23.820 I don't think I mean Charlie and I
00:16:26.639 we don't read anything about what
00:16:29.279 business is going the economy is going
00:16:31.019 to do or the Market's going to do or
00:16:32.820 what anybody anytime I see some article
00:16:35.040 it says you know these analysts say this
00:16:36.959 or that about
00:16:38.160 some business it just it doesn't mean
00:16:39.720 anything to us
00:16:41.480 you cannot you cannot get uh rich with a
00:16:45.779 Weather Vein and I would say this in
00:16:48.420 terms of the
00:16:49.920 of predictions and I know the spirit in
00:16:52.680 which you ask the question but
00:16:54.540 there's just there's a market out there
00:16:56.220 all the time uh and and people love to
00:16:59.699 hear predictions I mean if I said I was
00:17:01.560 going to offer a bunch of predictions
00:17:02.759 today I mean we would we would have a
00:17:05.220 million people here I mean that they're
00:17:07.439 dying to have predictions and speeches
00:17:09.480 at Rotary clubs or trade associations or
00:17:11.939 whatever that's they they just plain
00:17:13.799 love it and that's what a whole industry
00:17:15.839 is built upon you know the people coming
00:17:17.880 out of Washington that talk about
00:17:19.980 political predictions and the I don't
00:17:22.619 read those in the paper at all because
00:17:24.359 it's just it's it's space fillers uh
00:17:26.939 basically and uh uh you mentioned Edgar
00:17:30.299 Casey Ben Graham and knew Edgar Casey
00:17:32.880 pretty well but
00:17:35.400 I I just have never seen any utility to
00:17:37.679 any of that at all there will be some
00:17:39.539 huge surprises in the world
00:17:41.400 uh there's no question about that but I
00:17:44.220 don't I don't think that betting on any
00:17:46.500 specific one
00:17:48.360 is is a very smart policy in fact our we
00:17:51.660 usually bet against them in terms of
00:17:53.400 super catastrophes we know there will be
00:17:55.320 a 7.0 or greater quake in California in
00:17:59.520 the next 50 years we don't know where
00:18:00.900 it'll be or when it'll be anything like
00:18:02.280 that we're willing to pay out a lot of
00:18:04.559 money if it happens tomorrow
00:18:06.419 and because people
00:18:09.480 do worry about catastrophe and in this
00:18:11.760 case it's perfectly proper with with
00:18:13.200 insured values but it it just isn't any
00:18:16.380 way in in our view to get through
00:18:18.840 economic life Charlie
00:18:21.240 all of these economists with 160 IQs
00:18:24.179 have spend their life studying it can
00:18:26.160 you name me one super wealthy Economist
00:18:28.320 that's ever made money out of securities
00:18:30.120 you know I may just go down the list no
00:18:32.580 no Keynes Cain's actually
00:18:35.280 in his early years tried to make money
00:18:37.500 in stocks by predicting what business
00:18:40.500 would do and he gave it up and then he
00:18:42.840 went over to a Graham type approach I
00:18:44.700 mean it's very interesting to read his
00:18:46.200 history on this because he thought he
00:18:47.400 could by looking at various economic
00:18:49.440 variables
00:18:50.700 pick what he called the credit cycle and
00:18:52.500 make a lot of money and and he what
00:18:54.780 broke a couple of times and doing it had
00:18:56.280 to borrow from people and then he
00:18:57.480 settled on buying good businesses cheap
00:18:59.340 that he understood and concentrating his
00:19:01.020 Investments and he did very well it's an
00:19:03.059 interesting history but if you if you
00:19:04.740 look at the whole history of them you
00:19:06.600 know they don't make a lot of money
00:19:07.740 buying and selling stocks but people who
00:19:09.240 buy and sell stocks listen to him which
00:19:10.799 is I have a little trouble of that you
00:19:12.780 know I I'm not I've not earned any uh
00:19:14.580 any uh stars for my past economic
00:19:18.419 predictions and the good thing about my
00:19:19.620 economic predictions if I even do make
00:19:21.299 them is that I pay no attention to them
00:19:22.799 myself so uh I I really uh and the way
00:19:27.059 we pick our investments is we just don't
00:19:29.160 get into the macro factors I can't
00:19:31.500 recall
00:19:32.640 a time when Charlie and I have looked at
00:19:34.500 a business either buying it in its
00:19:36.720 entirety
00:19:37.679 or buying uh pieces of it for the stock
00:19:40.260 market
00:19:41.280 I just macro the conclusions or just
00:19:45.539 never never enter into the discussion I
00:19:48.120 mean you know I'll pick up the phone
00:19:49.500 we've had these two in recent months and
00:19:52.260 I'll tell Charlie about it and
00:19:54.240 you know we we talk about a few things
00:19:56.220 but we don't talk about anything
00:19:58.919 remotely
00:20:00.299 macro uh and and that's really the way
00:20:03.059 it'll stay
00:20:04.559 you know I I
00:20:07.020 I've seen a lot of Bank mergers recently
00:20:09.120 and one of the things they do because
00:20:10.140 they want to cut the costs and and
00:20:11.940 justify a merger which they're dying to
00:20:13.740 do I mean that's the reason they they so
00:20:16.080 they they cut costs they wouldn't have
00:20:17.400 cut if they if they weren't dying to do
00:20:18.900 the merger in the first place and get
00:20:20.039 bigger but that frequently I know one in
00:20:22.679 particular that I'm thinking of that you
00:20:24.480 know they'll cut out the economics
00:20:25.679 Department you know I always wonder why
00:20:27.000 the hell they had it in the first place
00:20:28.140 you know because what what do they do
00:20:30.900 you know I mean the guy comes in I says
00:20:33.179 I think GDP will be 4.6 this year
00:20:35.160 instead of 4.3 so what you know I mean
00:20:37.320 you're still trying to make every good
00:20:39.000 loan you can make and you're still
00:20:40.140 trying to take into positives
00:20:42.000 could be trying to cut costs worry again
00:20:44.039 it's got nothing to do with running the
00:20:45.840 business but but you know it it's it's
00:20:48.660 fashionable and every bank at its
00:20:50.880 Economist and economics department and
00:20:52.980 when a big client will come in they take
00:20:54.419 them to lunch and it just it always just
00:20:57.000 struck me as
00:20:58.260 it's just a lot of nonsense uh you know
00:21:00.480 so if we ever get a economics department
00:21:02.700 at Berkshire
00:21:04.140 sell the stock shortened
00:21:07.799 there was one other item in here I
00:21:09.600 believe
00:21:11.419 which I think achieved a little added
00:21:14.039 relevance in the last year
00:21:16.679 I said we therefore need
00:21:18.900 someone genetically programmed to
00:21:21.000 recognize and avoid serious risks and
00:21:23.220 then I put in italics
00:21:24.960 including those never before experienced
00:21:29.100 and I said certain perils that lurk and
00:21:32.039 investment strategies cannot be spotted
00:21:34.200 by one of the models by use of the
00:21:36.960 models commonly employed today by
00:21:38.880 financial institutions well I think that
00:21:42.120 proved to be somewhat
00:21:44.780 prophetic of what happened last year all
00:21:47.880 of these places had models I mean the
00:21:50.580 major Banks the major investment Banks
00:21:52.679 and they would meet weekly at a risk
00:21:55.559 committee probably and go over their
00:21:56.940 models and all of the statistics would
00:21:58.860 be printed in nice columns and
00:22:00.780 everything and they didn't have the
00:22:02.400 faintest idea what risk they were
00:22:04.440 involved you really need in the
00:22:06.419 investment world
00:22:08.039 someone very solid someone you trust
00:22:10.980 uh
00:22:12.600 reasonable analytical skills but you
00:22:15.600 also need someone that actually can
00:22:17.940 contemplate
00:22:19.380 problems that haven't popped up yet but
00:22:22.200 which are starting to become uh
00:22:26.900 possibilities in terms of new financial
00:22:30.240 instruments or new behaviors and markets
00:22:32.640 and that sort of thing and that's the
00:22:34.260 rare quality I mean that
00:22:36.480 that inability
00:22:38.580 to Envision something that doesn't show
00:22:42.360 up
00:22:43.380 in your past model
00:22:45.539 uh you know can be fatal and Charlie and
00:22:48.840 I spend a lot of time
00:22:50.640 thinking about things that could hit us
00:22:53.400 out of the blue
00:22:54.780 that other people don't include in their
00:22:57.360 thinking and the we may miss some
00:22:59.940 opportunities because of that
00:23:02.220 but we feel it's essential when managing
00:23:04.740 other people's money or for that matter
00:23:06.179 managing our own money so I would say
00:23:08.520 that
00:23:09.360 that you might go back and read the 2006
00:23:11.880 annual report again but those are the
00:23:13.380 criteria
00:23:14.720 uh we're looking for and
00:23:17.780 we have identified as being met by the
00:23:22.320 four people we're thinking about Charlie
00:23:26.100 yeah you can see how risk-averse
00:23:29.340 Berkshire is the first place we try and
00:23:31.740 behave in a way
00:23:33.600 so that no rational person is going to
00:23:36.539 worry about our credit
00:23:39.120 and after we've done that and done it
00:23:41.220 for many years we also behave in a way
00:23:45.179 and after we've done that and done it
00:23:47.220 for many years we also behave in a way
00:23:49.740 that if the world suddenly didn't like
00:23:52.260 our credit we wouldn't even notice it
00:23:54.059 for months that if the world suddenly
00:23:56.940 didn't like our credit we wouldn't even
00:23:59.159 notice it for months uh because we have
00:24:03.059 such liquidity and are so unlikely to be
00:24:06.020 unable to be pressured by anybody
00:24:09.299 that double layering of
00:24:11.820 of protection against risk is is like
00:24:15.600 breathing around Berkshire it's just
00:24:17.940 part of the culture and
00:24:20.940 the alternative culture
00:24:22.799 is just the opposite you call a man the
00:24:25.440 chief risk officer but often he is
00:24:28.380 functioning as a guy that makes you feel
00:24:30.299 good while you do dumb things
00:24:33.240 so he's like the delphic oracle
00:24:36.780 convinced the Persian king to attack
00:24:39.179 somebody or other I mean it's it's just
00:24:42.480 a dumb sister and and how can a guy be
00:24:46.799 Donald he's got a PhD and he can do all
00:24:49.440 this advanced math
00:24:51.240 well you can you can
00:24:55.080 but you can it's very well all you've
00:24:57.539 got to do is crave
00:25:00.179 system and computation so much that you
00:25:02.640 torture reality in defending some model
00:25:05.400 mathematical model which really doesn't
00:25:07.919 match particularly under extreme
00:25:10.620 conditions and then because of this work
00:25:13.440 that you're putting into everything and
00:25:15.179 these computations about daily trading
00:25:17.700 risk and so forth you feel confident
00:25:19.919 that you've clobbered the risk
00:25:23.039 but you haven't you've just clobbered up
00:25:24.900 your own head
00:25:27.779 yeah we we really want to run Berkshire
00:25:31.980 you know
00:25:33.980 I'll even applaud that one we we really
00:25:37.380 want to run Berkshire so that if the
00:25:39.539 world isn't working tomorrow the way
00:25:41.279 it's working today or the and it's
00:25:42.779 working in a way nobody expected that we
00:25:45.360 don't have a problem we do not want to
00:25:47.340 be dependent
00:25:48.659 on anybody or anything else uh
00:25:53.000 and yet we want to keep doing things so
00:25:55.799 uh
00:25:58.080 we found a way to do it we think we
00:25:59.760 found a way to do that it may give up
00:26:01.799 some of them well it obviously gives up
00:26:04.380 earning higher returns 99 percent of the
00:26:07.320 time and maybe 99.9 percent of the time
00:26:10.700 obviously we could have run Berkshire
00:26:12.600 with more leverage over the years than
00:26:14.100 we have
00:26:15.299 but we wouldn't have slept as well and
00:26:17.820 and we wouldn't feel comfortable we have
00:26:20.760 a lot of people in this room that have
00:26:22.740 almost all their net worth in Berkshire
00:26:24.299 including me and we wouldn't feel
00:26:27.240 comfortable uh running a business that
00:26:30.240 way why do it I mean it doesn't it just
00:26:32.159 doesn't make any sense to us to
00:26:34.380 to be exposed to ruin and disgrace and
00:26:38.220 embarrassment and uh for something
00:26:41.640 that's not that meaningful if we could
00:26:43.679 earn a decent return on Capital you know
00:26:46.559 what's an extra percentage point it just
00:26:48.539 isn't that important so
00:26:50.100 we will always try to behave in a way
00:26:51.960 that uh
00:26:53.100 a is not dependent on anybody else
00:26:55.500 evaluating the risk except for us it
00:26:58.080 cannot be farmed out and you've seen
00:27:00.600 what happened to some institutions where
00:27:02.400 the management thought they were farming
00:27:04.440 it out and
00:27:07.080 you know if that means so a reasonable
00:27:09.360 return instead of a slightly
00:27:10.559 unreasonable region we just accept it
00:27:13.320 number two
00:27:16.919 hello Mr Buffett hello Mr Monger my name
00:27:19.620 is Brooke athletic and I'm from Munich
00:27:21.419 Germany
00:27:22.760 I would like to get back to your point
00:27:25.500 that as a professional investor one
00:27:28.500 should be able to act quickly and
00:27:30.720 decisive that means being able to know
00:27:33.720 what the intrinsic value is and to act
00:27:36.240 within a day or within an hour if the
00:27:38.940 market offers an opportunity my question
00:27:41.940 is how large is the universe of
00:27:45.179 companies which you have in your head
00:27:47.360 whose intrinsic value you know where you
00:27:51.120 would be able to act within a day or two
00:27:54.000 if the market offered an attractive
00:27:56.220 price to you and secondly how come you
00:27:59.760 suddenly invest in southern Korea or
00:28:02.640 China
00:28:04.200 yeah we can we can act
00:28:06.900 our our immediate decision is whether we
00:28:09.960 can figure the what's being offered out
00:28:11.700 to us or not I mean there's a there's a
00:28:13.919 go no go signal and Charlie and I are
00:28:16.440 often thought to be rude when we think
00:28:18.059 we're just being polite and not wasting
00:28:20.100 the other person's time so as they start
00:28:23.039 mid-sentence in their first conversation
00:28:25.799 with us we just say forget it and uh
00:28:29.039 Charlie's pretty good at that and I'm
00:28:30.659 picking it up the
00:28:33.419 it's
00:28:35.220 we know very very very early in the
00:28:37.980 conversation whether somebody's talking
00:28:40.140 about something that there's any chance
00:28:43.140 is actionable by us
00:28:45.240 and we don't worry about the ones we
00:28:47.880 miss
00:28:49.220 we we want to make sure that we don't
00:28:52.440 waste any time thinking about things
00:28:54.600 that when we get all through thinking
00:28:55.740 about them we're not going to know
00:28:57.059 enough to make the decision on so we
00:28:58.799 just rule those out and that rules a lot
00:29:00.539 of things out then
00:29:03.480 if it gets through a couple of these
00:29:05.460 filters
00:29:06.559 and makes it in to an area where it says
00:29:10.020 this is something that we know enough
00:29:12.840 about to make a decision on
00:29:15.360 we're ready to move right then so we
00:29:17.100 make decisions we can make a decision in
00:29:19.440 five minutes very easily I mean it just
00:29:21.299 is not that complicated now we know
00:29:23.279 about a number of businesses and
00:29:24.600 industries and there's a lot of
00:29:25.500 businesses and industries we don't know
00:29:26.820 anything about we know about a lot of
00:29:29.220 things about certain kinds of bonds and
00:29:30.899 we know some there's a variety of things
00:29:32.700 we know about and it's nice that we can
00:29:35.700 expand that Universe of of knowledge but
00:29:39.059 the most important thing is that that
00:29:40.919 anything that gets through
00:29:43.020 is in an area of knowledge and the truth
00:29:45.779 is if we can't make a decision in five
00:29:47.580 minutes we can't make it in five months
00:29:49.200 you know there's we're not going to
00:29:50.580 learn enough in the following five
00:29:52.080 months to make up for the fact that we
00:29:54.059 went in deficient in the first place so
00:29:56.820 it's it's it's just not a problem around
00:29:58.679 Berkshire if we get a call
00:30:00.960 and somebody says either they've got a
00:30:03.360 business for sale
00:30:04.620 or well that's that's what we're going
00:30:07.200 to get on the calls or if I'm reading a
00:30:09.360 paper or a magazine or an annual report
00:30:11.460 or a 10K
00:30:13.020 and
00:30:14.760 I look at a price and there's a
00:30:16.559 significant differential between price
00:30:18.240 and value
00:30:19.380 we move right then and Charlie and I
00:30:21.720 don't need to talk to each other about
00:30:22.919 it I mean we both think the same way and
00:30:24.539 and we have generally similar spheres of
00:30:26.940 knowledge Charlie
00:30:29.279 oh it's
00:30:31.919 the answer to your question is we can
00:30:33.960 make a lot of decisions about a lot of
00:30:36.059 things
00:30:36.960 very fast and very easily
00:30:39.299 and the and and we're unusual in that
00:30:42.299 respect
00:30:43.500 and the reason we're able to do that is
00:30:47.399 there's such an enormous other lot of
00:30:49.620 things that we won't allow ourselves to
00:30:51.840 think about at all
00:30:55.080 just that simple I mean I have a little
00:30:58.080 phrase when people make pictures to me
00:31:00.000 and about halfway through the first
00:31:01.200 sentence I say we don't do startups
00:31:04.799 they don't exist oh look you blot out
00:31:07.260 startups there's a whole layer of
00:31:08.820 complexity that goes on in your life
00:31:11.039 and we've got other little water out
00:31:13.799 systems and and
00:31:16.679 using those we finally find out that
00:31:19.679 what remains is still a pretty large
00:31:21.360 territory that we can't handle I think
00:31:23.760 that's fair warm yeah and yeah and an
00:31:26.760 awful lot of giveaways that people in
00:31:29.039 the first sentence or two uh throw out
00:31:32.100 that you know we just know we aren't
00:31:34.980 you know it isn't going to work and uh
00:31:39.539 we waste very I would say we waste a lot
00:31:42.179 of time but we wasted on things we want
00:31:43.980 to waste our time up and we we we're
00:31:47.039 very selective about that and then we're
00:31:48.600 good at it we waste a lot of time uh but
00:31:51.960 we're not going to waste it on things we
00:31:53.640 don't want to waste it up
00:31:55.679 number three
00:31:58.380 it's just the way it is uh yeah if you
00:32:02.899 it's as though God made the world so the
00:32:06.840 only people fluent in math could
00:32:08.580 understand it either you can handle
00:32:10.740 ordinary human activity pretty well but
00:32:14.100 if you want to understand say science
00:32:17.039 you can't do it without math
00:32:20.159 that's just the way it is and in
00:32:22.320 business if you're enumerate you're
00:32:25.320 going to be a klutz
00:32:29.940 keep talking I'm chewing and
00:32:35.640 we'll go back go ahead the good thing
00:32:37.440 about business is you don't have to know
00:32:40.380 any High math
00:32:43.500 it may be a disadvantage no no high math
00:32:45.960 yes I think it is because you you look
00:32:48.659 for opportunities to use this marvelous
00:32:51.240 complicated tool
00:32:52.860 and uh and by and large that doesn't
00:32:55.679 work nearly as well as just using the
00:32:57.539 simple math
00:32:58.919 when my mother's sang me songs about
00:33:01.080 compound interest there really wasn't
00:33:03.059 any need to go further
00:33:07.860 let's go back to number one
00:33:12.000 my name is David Farlow from Minnesota
00:33:14.640 Minneapolis
00:33:15.960 thank you Warren and Charlie
00:33:18.360 a few minutes ago you mentioned the
00:33:20.399 importance of learning from history
00:33:22.500 what have you learned from the
00:33:24.000 Investments you did not make over the
00:33:25.919 last few years that you now regret
00:33:28.620 refraining from
00:33:31.260 well the mistakes we made and we made
00:33:33.720 them some of them big time
00:33:36.179 are
00:33:38.100 of two kinds
00:33:40.019 one is one we didn't invest at all in
00:33:42.480 something that we understood that was
00:33:43.860 cheap
00:33:45.440 maybe because we weren't even working
00:33:48.419 hard enough but
00:33:49.799 at looking at the whole list or because
00:33:54.240 for one reason another we just didn't we
00:33:56.279 didn't take action and the second was
00:33:58.200 starting in on something that could have
00:34:00.299 been been a very large investment and
00:34:01.980 and and not maximizing it Charlie is a
00:34:05.399 huge believer in
00:34:06.840 in the idea that you don't sit around
00:34:08.219 sucking your thumb when you can when
00:34:10.440 something comes along that should be
00:34:11.820 done that you you pour into it and and
00:34:14.820 that's generally what we've tried to do
00:34:16.500 but
00:34:17.399 but there have been times and it's
00:34:20.460 usually happened when I've started
00:34:22.619 buying something at X and it went up to
00:34:24.480 X plus an eighth or some intolerable
00:34:26.760 amount like that and
00:34:29.000 I I quit or waited for it to come back
00:34:32.699 and we've missed in some cases billions
00:34:34.980 of dollars of profit because of the fact
00:34:37.320 that I'd gotten anchored in effect to
00:34:40.440 some initial price when I could have
00:34:42.719 paid more subsequently and it really was
00:34:45.540 inconsequential do you have anything
00:34:47.839 worse to confess than Walmart a Walmart
00:34:52.859 I cost us about
00:34:56.879 it's up to 10 billion now
00:34:59.300 I cost us about 10 billion uh I set out
00:35:03.000 to buy 100 million shares of
00:35:05.220 Walmart pre-split at about 23.
00:35:09.300 and Charlie
00:35:12.260 said it didn't sound like the worst idea
00:35:15.119 I ever came up with which is from him I
00:35:16.859 was just ungodly praise and
00:35:20.400 and then you know we bought a little and
00:35:22.200 then it moved up a little bit
00:35:24.180 and I thought well
00:35:26.339 you know maybe it'll come back or what
00:35:28.020 who knows what I thought I mean you know
00:35:30.180 only my psychiatrist could tell me and
00:35:33.200 that thumb sucking reluctance to pay a
00:35:37.800 little more
00:35:38.700 the current cost is
00:35:40.980 is in the area of of of 10 of 10 billion
00:35:44.700 and there have been other examples too
00:35:47.099 uh
00:35:48.619 uh and there will probably be more
00:35:51.060 examples in the future unfortunately but
00:35:53.339 that is
00:35:54.359 that's on the other hand it doesn't
00:35:56.040 bother us I mean you know it uh
00:35:58.920 it's it's maybe instructional to talk
00:36:01.920 about it just a little and I'm glad to
00:36:03.480 respond to the question but in the end
00:36:04.740 we're going to make a lot of mistakes at
00:36:06.720 Berkshire and we've made them in the
00:36:08.760 past we'll make them in the future
00:36:10.440 you know it if every shot you hit in
00:36:12.540 golf was a hole in one it wouldn't be my
00:36:14.220 you know the game would soon lose
00:36:15.420 interest uh so you have to hit a few in
00:36:17.940 the woods occasionally just to make it
00:36:19.380 make it a little more interesting that
00:36:21.240 we'll try not to do that too often but
00:36:23.940 those will be the kind of mistakes we
00:36:25.800 make we probably won't make the kind of
00:36:27.420 mistakes although we have we made one
00:36:29.400 with Dexter shoe but we we probably
00:36:31.920 won't make the kind that where they cost
00:36:33.720 us a ton of money uh that uh they'll be
00:36:37.020 much more of omission than commission I
00:36:39.540 think you'll find in the future Charlie
00:36:41.160 won't add any more
00:36:42.780 at least we are constantly thinking
00:36:46.320 about the past occasions when we blew
00:36:49.079 opportunities
00:36:50.339 since those don't hit Financial reports
00:36:53.400 the opportunities you had but didn't
00:36:55.619 accept
00:36:56.700 most people don't bother thinking about
00:36:58.560 them very much at least that is a
00:37:01.440 mistake we don't make we rub our own
00:37:03.420 noses in our mistakes in Blowing
00:37:07.380 opportunities as we just did
00:37:11.579 okay number two
00:37:13.920 how many hours per week on average did
00:37:17.160 you spend with reading about companies
00:37:19.859 thank you
00:37:22.260 well when we were younger
00:37:25.500 we spent
00:37:29.160 um probably Charlie compared to now
00:37:30.720 spent a lot more time I spent a fair
00:37:32.640 amount more time looking at companies uh
00:37:36.000 but we would we would
00:37:38.040 if we were doing it over again we would
00:37:39.960 do it over again pretty much the same
00:37:41.460 way we would look at everything in sight
00:37:44.099 that we thought we could understand
00:37:46.020 and
00:37:47.760 uh
00:37:49.800 it the world hasn't changed in that
00:37:52.500 respect there may be some more people
00:37:54.359 doing it but there are a lot more
00:37:55.980 companies to look at now uh and we would
00:37:59.520 we would read everything in sight about
00:38:01.619 the businesses in the industries we
00:38:03.720 thought we could understand we would
00:38:05.040 look for things that that jumped out at
00:38:07.260 us as as being very cheap in relation to
00:38:10.200 to value and we would have one enormous
00:38:12.180 Advantage because we would be working
00:38:13.920 with far less Capital which means the
00:38:15.780 universal potential ideas would be would
00:38:18.420 be far greater but there's no
00:38:21.720 there's nothing different in my view
00:38:23.760 about analyzing Securities now than it
00:38:25.680 was 50 years ago Charlie
00:38:29.579 yeah we we read a lot and we thought a
00:38:32.520 lot
00:38:33.300 I don't know anybody who is wise who
00:38:36.119 doesn't read a lot
00:38:38.040 and on the other hand that that alone
00:38:40.260 won't do it
00:38:41.780 you have to have a a
00:38:45.660 temperament really which
00:38:47.940 which
00:38:49.619 uh grabs the correct ideas
00:38:52.800 and and does something
00:38:55.740 with those ideas
00:38:57.900 and I think most people who read a lot
00:39:01.500 don't have the necessary temperament and
00:39:03.720 they grab the ideas or they're simply
00:39:06.180 confused by the massive material and of
00:39:08.880 course that won't work
00:39:11.400 there's probably something Phil cray
00:39:13.440 used to talk about having a money mind
00:39:15.119 or and I would call it a business mind
00:39:17.339 and you know there are people that
00:39:20.220 are better with you know identical IQs
00:39:23.579 that are that are better adapted for one
00:39:26.280 than the other and and the temperament
00:39:28.859 is all important I mean if if you can't
00:39:31.140 control yourself
00:39:33.619 uh no matter what
00:39:36.060 the intellect you bring to the pros
00:39:37.920 process you know you're going you're
00:39:39.780 going to have a you're going to have
00:39:40.740 disasters and Charlie and I have seen
00:39:42.839 one after another that uh
00:39:45.300 uh it's it's not a business that
00:39:47.520 requires
00:39:48.780 uh
00:39:50.160 extraordinary intellect
00:39:52.260 uh it doesn't require an extraordinary
00:39:54.720 discipline and uh uh
00:39:58.020 that shouldn't be so difficult but as I
00:39:59.880 look around the world sometimes it
00:40:01.920 apparently is quite difficult I mean the
00:40:04.260 whole world when little mad a few years
00:40:06.720 back in terms of Investments and and uh
00:40:10.619 you say to yourself how could that
00:40:12.000 happen don't they learn anything from
00:40:13.200 the earlier ones but
00:40:14.880 but you know what we learned from
00:40:16.500 history is that people don't learn from
00:40:17.880 history and you certainly see that in
00:40:20.400 the National markets
00:40:22.200 all the time
00:40:24.180 them incidentally you mentioned books
00:40:26.520 Charlie did you didn't recommend any
00:40:28.380 books this year well one book I really
00:40:31.079 like
00:40:32.040 I couldn't buy because it's published
00:40:34.619 only in England
00:40:36.119 but it'll get here in due course and
00:40:38.880 that's called Deep Simplicity by John
00:40:41.700 gribben it's a perfectly marvelous
00:40:45.060 book and of course that's a great title
00:40:47.520 deep simplicity
00:40:49.859 that's what we're all looking for
00:40:52.859 I've been reading a short history of
00:40:54.480 nearly everything and
00:40:56.640 it it it is it's very impressive to
00:41:00.240 you know to read about people pondering
00:41:02.040 how to figure out the weight of the
00:41:03.180 Earth or something in the 18th century
00:41:05.460 and you would think Minds that could do
00:41:07.560 that would
00:41:08.579 do we work do very well in financial
00:41:10.260 matters but you know if you remember
00:41:13.020 Isaac Newton spent
00:41:15.060 a significant part of his life trying to
00:41:17.820 turn lead into gold
00:41:19.560 and
00:41:21.300 he might have made a good stockbroker
00:41:23.900 but it didn't do much for him
00:41:26.220 financially he Charlie knows more about
00:41:28.500 Isaac than I do so and he lost an
00:41:30.900 enormous yeah the bubble chunk of his
00:41:33.180 net worth in the South Seas bubble so he
00:41:36.359 invested in an absolute crooked Mania
00:41:39.300 and here was the smartest man in the
00:41:41.640 world so
00:41:42.780 just IQ points alone won't do it
00:41:46.500 microphone 11 please
00:41:48.540 Wall Street and financial planning firms
00:41:51.359 charge a lot of money for their asset
00:41:53.339 allocation models say 50 stocks 40 bonds
00:41:58.200 Etc I know you take a more opportunistic
00:42:01.500 approach
00:42:02.520 to building your portfolio and managing
00:42:06.480 risk
00:42:07.560 as you mentioned by as you illustrated
00:42:10.440 by your junk bond example
00:42:12.839 and so I just want you to
00:42:15.920 hammer out how you use price and value
00:42:20.000 as a tool of risk management and US
00:42:23.579 allocation as opposed to coming at it
00:42:26.280 with a preconceived idea of how much
00:42:29.220 should be allocated to each asset class
00:42:31.320 yeah we think the best way to minimize
00:42:34.200 risk is to think
00:42:36.079 the
00:42:37.740 and the idea
00:42:39.359 that you have you know you'll say I've
00:42:40.920 got 60 in stocks and 40 in bonds and and
00:42:44.400 then have a big announcement now we're
00:42:45.839 moving it to 65 35 as some
00:42:50.520 strategist or whatever they call them in
00:42:52.560 Wall Street I mean that has to be pure
00:42:54.960 nonsense I mean it uh
00:42:58.020 UH 60 40 or 65 30. it just doesn't make
00:43:01.200 any sense what you ought to do
00:43:03.900 is have your default position is always
00:43:06.359 short-term instruments and whatever you
00:43:08.400 see anything intelligent to do you
00:43:09.599 should do it and you shouldn't be trying
00:43:11.460 to to match up with some
00:43:14.660 uh some goal like that I I found it
00:43:17.339 entertaining I was just reading
00:43:18.900 yesterday an article I think it was the
00:43:21.300 about the two fellows at Google and and
00:43:23.640 all of the problems they're going to
00:43:25.140 have because they're each going to get a
00:43:26.280 few billion dollars and I mean it was it
00:43:28.680 was I mean I want to send a sympathy
00:43:30.960 card I almost went down a Hallmark store
00:43:32.940 because this article went on they've got
00:43:35.099 this this terrible problem that terrible
00:43:36.660 problem they're going to need lawyers
00:43:37.859 and they're going to need financial they
00:43:39.240 don't need anybody those guys are
00:43:40.800 smarter than the people that are coming
00:43:42.060 to them and they do not have a big
00:43:44.400 problem and and they're very capable of
00:43:46.380 thinking it through themselves the
00:43:48.240 people that have the problem are the
00:43:49.800 people who want to sell their services
00:43:51.119 to them and are going to have to
00:43:53.400 convince them that they have a problem
00:43:54.680 but uh
00:43:56.940 so much of what you see
00:43:59.640 when you talk about asset allocations I
00:44:01.560 mean it's just merchandising it's a way
00:44:03.900 to make you think that if you don't know
00:44:05.520 how to determine whether it should be 60
00:44:07.500 40 or 65 35 that you need these people
00:44:10.800 and you don't need them at all in
00:44:12.119 investing I mean most of the
00:44:13.980 professionals that that uh
00:44:16.680 tell you you're that you're going to get
00:44:18.300 in great trouble unless you listen to
00:44:19.680 them and and adopt and and sign up for
00:44:22.619 their services you know they're good at
00:44:25.079 selling but uh
00:44:27.420 um my brother-in-law former
00:44:29.099 brother-in-law that worked at the
00:44:30.920 Stockyards used to say with the people
00:44:33.780 were bringing cattle or something and
00:44:35.280 I'd say to him you know how do you get
00:44:37.200 how do you get the farmer to
00:44:39.960 employ you to sell the Swift or armor or
00:44:42.480 Cudahy instead of them
00:44:45.480 guy right next to you I mean you know
00:44:46.980 it's a cow is a cow and
00:44:49.079 armor is going to buy it the same way
00:44:50.640 and
00:44:51.540 he gave me this disgusted look and he
00:44:53.220 said Warren it's not how you sell them
00:44:55.260 it's how you tell them well there's a
00:44:57.540 lot of that in Wall Street and Charlie
00:45:01.740 people have always had this craving to
00:45:04.020 know the future you know the King used
00:45:06.359 to hire the magician or the forecast or
00:45:09.780 any looking sheep guts or something for
00:45:12.180 an answer as to how to handle the next
00:45:14.220 war and so there's always been a market
00:45:17.099 for people who reported to know the
00:45:19.920 future based on their expertise and
00:45:22.380 there's a lot of that still going on
00:45:24.480 it's just as crazy as when the King was
00:45:27.060 hiring the the forecaster who looked at
00:45:30.599 the Sheep guts and
00:45:33.300 people have an economic incentive
00:45:35.880 to sell some nostrum it can be sold over
00:45:39.720 and over and over again the really
00:45:42.480 interesting figures are when you combine
00:45:44.640 the underperformance of the market say
00:45:47.640 by the mutual fund industry which is
00:45:50.520 probably a couple of points per annum
00:45:54.300 that that understates it now if you take
00:45:56.819 all of the
00:45:58.319 investors in the mutual funds who are
00:46:00.599 constantly whipsawing from One Fund to
00:46:03.540 another by a bunch of brokers who want
00:46:05.760 commissions
00:46:06.900 now you take a subnormal performance and
00:46:09.300 it goes down another three or four
00:46:10.980 percentage points
00:46:13.800 due to the shuffling of the mutual fund
00:46:16.619 Investments so the poor guy in the
00:46:18.839 General Public
00:46:20.040 is getting a terrible result from uh
00:46:23.819 from from contacting the experts and
00:46:26.579 these guys are heading the Scout Troop
00:46:28.200 and the community chest drive and are
00:46:30.060 locally reputable people I think it's
00:46:32.760 disgusting it's much better to make a
00:46:35.880 living but by being part of a system
00:46:38.520 that delivers value to the people who
00:46:42.119 are who are buying the product
00:46:44.460 but nobody
00:46:46.800 nobody uh refrains from creating
00:46:49.140 gambling casinos or something on my
00:46:51.000 theory
00:46:53.460 if it'll work to make money away we tend
00:46:56.099 to do it in this country
00:46:59.700 microphone four
00:47:03.540 can you please elaborate your views on
00:47:05.700 risk you clearly aren't a fan of relying
00:47:08.640 on statistical probabilities and you
00:47:10.800 highlight the need for 20 billion
00:47:12.240 dollars in cash to feel comfortable why
00:47:14.880 is that the magic number and has it
00:47:16.920 changed over time yeah well it isn't the
00:47:19.619 magic number and
00:47:22.200 uh there is no magic number uh I would
00:47:25.680 get very worried about somebody that
00:47:27.240 walked in every morning and told us
00:47:28.640 precisely how many dollars of cash we
00:47:30.900 needed to be you know secured to three
00:47:33.720 sigma or something like that but Charlie
00:47:37.020 and I have had a lot of we saw a lot of
00:47:39.359 problems developing in an organization
00:47:41.220 that that
00:47:42.800 expressed their risks and sigma uh
00:47:46.319 and we even argued sometimes with the
00:47:48.960 appropriateness of of how they
00:47:50.819 calculated their risk and they it was
00:47:52.740 truly horrible
00:47:53.880 yeah and they were a lot smarter than we
00:47:55.800 were that's what was depressing but um
00:48:02.940 we
00:48:04.800 we both have the same band of mind
00:48:07.740 whereby we we think about worst cases
00:48:10.500 all the time and then we add on a big
00:48:13.800 margin of safety and
00:48:16.140 uh we don't want to go back to go I mean
00:48:19.440 I I enjoy tossing those papers in the
00:48:21.420 other room but uh I don't want to do it
00:48:24.300 for a living again it
00:48:26.119 so we undoubtedly
00:48:29.520 build in layers of
00:48:31.560 of of safety that others might regard as
00:48:34.859 foolish
00:48:36.020 uh but we've got 600 000 shareholders
00:48:39.300 and we've got members of my family that
00:48:41.099 have 80 or 90 percent of their net worth
00:48:43.619 in the company and I'm I'm just not
00:48:45.420 interested in explaining to them
00:48:47.520 that we went broke because
00:48:50.460 there was a 100 to one percent chance
00:48:53.359 that we would go broke and there was a
00:48:56.240 remaining uh probability was filled by
00:48:59.880 the chance of doubling our money and I
00:49:02.400 decided that that was just a good gamble
00:49:04.200 to take we're not going to do that it it
00:49:06.000 uh
00:49:07.319 it doesn't mean that much we are never
00:49:09.240 going to risk
00:49:10.560 what we have and need for what we don't
00:49:12.960 have and don't need we'll still find
00:49:15.180 things to do
00:49:16.460 where we can make money but we don't
00:49:19.200 have to stretch to do it and uh
00:49:23.819 as my job and and you know and Charlie
00:49:26.520 thinks the same way I mean we're uh we
00:49:29.520 don't talk have to talk about it much
00:49:30.839 but
00:49:31.740 but it's our job
00:49:34.260 to figure out what can really go wrong
00:49:36.060 with this place and you know we've seen
00:49:39.000 September 11th and we've seen
00:49:41.339 we've seen September of
00:49:42.980 2008 and we'll see other things of a
00:49:46.380 different nature but
00:49:47.940 similar impact
00:49:49.800 in the future and we not only want to
00:49:53.520 sleep well of those nights we want to be
00:49:55.260 thinking about things to do with some
00:49:57.540 excess money we might have around so it
00:50:00.180 is
00:50:01.440 if you're calibrating it
00:50:03.900 in some mathematical way
00:50:06.839 I would say it's really dangerous I
00:50:08.579 could give you a couple of examples on
00:50:10.200 that but that unfortunately there
00:50:12.359 I've learned about them on a
00:50:13.920 confidential basis but but some really
00:50:17.040 great organizations
00:50:19.079 have had dozens of people
00:50:22.200 with Advanced mathematical training
00:50:25.140 and make and thinking about it daily
00:50:27.680 making computations
00:50:30.359 and they don't really
00:50:33.300 they don't really get at the problem uh
00:50:36.420 so it
00:50:38.520 it's at the top of the Mind always
00:50:40.140 around Berkshire and
00:50:42.300 your returns in 99 years out of 100 will
00:50:45.599 probably be penalized by being us being
00:50:48.800 excessively conservative and one year
00:50:51.119 out of 100 will survive when some other
00:50:53.579 people won't Charlie yeah but how do
00:50:57.180 these super smart people with all these
00:50:59.460 degrees and higher mathematics end up
00:51:02.700 doing these dumb things
00:51:05.940 I think it's explainable
00:51:08.640 by the old proverb that to a man with a
00:51:11.819 hammer every problem looks pretty much
00:51:13.440 like a nail
00:51:14.880 they they've learned these techniques
00:51:17.400 and they
00:51:18.480 they just twist the problem absolutely
00:51:21.059 fit the solution which is not the way to
00:51:23.520 do it
00:51:25.380 and they have a lack of understanding of
00:51:27.059 History I would say that one of the
00:51:28.440 things in 1962
00:51:30.599 when I set up our office Key West Plaza
00:51:33.599 where we still are at some different
00:51:35.220 floor
00:51:36.960 I put seven
00:51:38.880 items on the wall our art budget was
00:51:41.640 seven dollars and I went down to the
00:51:43.380 library and for a dollar each I made
00:51:45.960 photocopies of
00:51:47.579 of the pages of from Financial history
00:51:50.119 and one of those cases for example was
00:51:53.640 in May of 1901
00:51:56.220 won the Northern Pacific Corner occurred
00:51:58.440 and
00:51:59.339 it's kind of interesting in terms of
00:52:01.079 being in Omaha because
00:52:02.900 Herriman was trying to get control of
00:52:06.000 the Northern Pacific and James J Hill
00:52:07.740 was trying to control the Northern
00:52:09.119 Pacific and unbeknownst to each other
00:52:10.859 they both bought more than 50 percent of
00:52:13.319 the stock
00:52:14.400 now when two people buy more than 50
00:52:17.460 percent of the stock each
00:52:19.380 and they both really wanted they're not
00:52:21.839 just going to resell it
00:52:23.760 you know interesting things happen to
00:52:25.920 the shorts and
00:52:29.099 in that paper
00:52:30.839 of May 1901 the whole rest of the market
00:52:34.140 was totally collapsing because Northern
00:52:36.240 Pacific went from 170 dollars a share to
00:52:38.760 one thousand dollars a share in one day
00:52:40.760 trading for cash because the shorts
00:52:43.319 needed it and there was a little item at
00:52:46.619 the top of that paper
00:52:48.200 which we still have at the office uh
00:52:51.660 where a brewer
00:52:53.460 in Troy New York
00:52:55.800 committed suicide by diving into a vat
00:52:58.140 of hot beer because he'd gotten a margin
00:52:59.940 call
00:53:01.079 and to me the lesson that that fellow
00:53:04.020 probably understood sigmas and
00:53:05.520 everything and knew how impossible it
00:53:07.680 was that in one day a stock could go
00:53:10.260 from 170 to a thousand to cause margin
00:53:12.480 calls on everything else and he ended up
00:53:14.819 in the vat of hot beer and I've never
00:53:16.200 wanted to end up in Nevada so
00:53:18.780 had those seven days that I put up on
00:53:22.079 the wall
00:53:23.819 life
00:53:25.319 and financial markets
00:53:27.960 has got no relation to sigmas I mean if
00:53:30.839 if everybody that operated in financial
00:53:32.700 markets had never had any concept of
00:53:36.240 standard errors and so on they would be
00:53:38.700 a lot better off don't you think so
00:53:40.319 Charlie
00:53:42.480 well sure
00:53:45.420 there have some questions it's created a
00:53:48.480 lot of false confidence
00:53:50.160 and
00:53:52.140 now it has gone away again as I said
00:53:55.559 earlier the business schools have
00:53:56.940 improved so has risk control on Wall
00:53:59.280 Street
00:54:00.300 they now have taken the gaussian curve
00:54:03.119 and they just changed it away they threw
00:54:05.280 it away well they put they just made a
00:54:07.859 different shape than Gauss did
00:54:10.200 and uh and it's it's a better curve now
00:54:13.020 even though it's less precise they talk
00:54:16.020 about fat tails but they still don't
00:54:17.400 know how fat to make them they have no
00:54:19.020 idea
00:54:19.800 well but they knew that they've learned
00:54:22.140 through painful yeah they weren't fat
00:54:23.640 enough
00:54:25.140 yeah they learned the other was wrong
00:54:26.460 yeah but they don't know what's right um
00:54:29.520 but we we always knew that they were
00:54:31.740 there were fat tails Warren and eye of
00:54:34.260 the Solomon meetings would look over at
00:54:35.640 one another and roll our eyes when the
00:54:37.200 risk control people were talking
00:54:39.720 thank you Bill Ackman from New York New
00:54:42.300 York
00:54:43.020 for the handful of AAA rated companies
00:54:45.420 AIG Fannie Mae Freddie Mac and mbia are
00:54:48.900 under formal investigation for
00:54:50.339 accounting Shenanigans and are in the
00:54:52.260 process of restating their financials
00:54:53.819 like Charlie said before I think of AAA
00:54:56.040 rated company as an Exemplar a company
00:54:57.900 that should behave in the with the
00:54:59.280 highest accounting and ethical standards
00:55:01.800 my questions this leads me to are how
00:55:04.800 can investors comfortably invest in any
00:55:07.500 Financial Service Company when even when
00:55:10.619 a decent percentage of the AAA rated
00:55:12.540 companies have false and misleading
00:55:14.940 financials and I guess the follow-up
00:55:16.859 question is why don't the rating
00:55:18.839 agencies do some independent due
00:55:20.460 diligence uh from an accounting
00:55:22.559 standpoint so that they can help serve
00:55:25.559 as a watch on this issue well Financial
00:55:29.760 companies are more difficult
00:55:32.400 to analyze than uh than many companies I
00:55:35.880 mean the it is more
00:55:38.359 if you take the insurance business
00:55:41.220 you know the biggest single element that
00:55:43.260 is very difficult
00:55:44.700 to evaluate even if you own the company
00:55:47.640 uh
00:55:49.800 uh is is the loss and loss adjustment
00:55:52.500 expense reserve and that has a huge
00:55:54.359 impact on reported earnings of Any Given
00:55:57.240 period and the shorter the period the
00:55:58.800 more the impact can be from just small
00:56:00.540 changes in assumptions uh you know we
00:56:03.960 carry we'll say 45 billion of loss
00:56:06.480 reserves but
00:56:07.920 you know if I had to bet my life
00:56:10.260 on whether 45 billion turned out to be a
00:56:12.839 little over a little under I mean it
00:56:14.339 said it'd be it I think a long time and
00:56:17.579 uh
00:56:18.680 you could just as easily have a figure
00:56:21.119 of 45 and a half billion or forty four
00:56:23.339 and a half billion and if you were
00:56:25.020 concerned about reporting given earnings
00:56:26.880 in a given period that would be an easy
00:56:29.160 game to play
00:56:31.380 in a bank you know it it basically is
00:56:34.920 what whether the loans are any good and
00:56:38.520 I've been on the boards of Banks and
00:56:40.260 that's you know I've gotten surprises at
00:56:42.660 stuff to tell
00:56:43.940 uh it's Financial companies if you're
00:56:47.040 analyzing something like WD-40 you know
00:56:50.040 or See's candy or
00:56:52.800 um our brick business or whatever
00:56:55.619 you know they they may have good or bad
00:56:57.720 prospects but you're not likely to be
00:57:00.119 fooling yourself much about what's going
00:57:02.099 on currently but with financial
00:57:03.480 institutions it's much tougher then you
00:57:06.000 can add throw in derivatives on top of
00:57:08.040 it
00:57:08.839 and you know it's it's
00:57:12.660 no one probably knows you know perfectly
00:57:15.480 what some of it or even within a
00:57:17.819 reasonable range the exact condition of
00:57:21.359 some of the biggest you know banks in
00:57:23.160 the world and but that brings you back
00:57:25.200 to the due diligence question of the
00:57:27.540 agencies
00:57:28.680 you had very high grade
00:57:31.440 very smart financially smart people
00:57:35.040 on the boards of both Freddy and Fanny
00:57:37.319 and yet you know one was five billion
00:57:39.119 and one was apparently nine billion
00:57:40.980 those are big numbers and I don't think
00:57:44.640 those people were negligent
00:57:46.460 and it's just it's very very tough
00:57:50.880 to know precisely what's going on in a
00:57:53.160 financial institution Charlie and I were
00:57:56.160 directors of Solomon
00:57:58.380 and Charlie was on the audit committee
00:58:00.420 and I forget the size of a few of those
00:58:02.819 things that that you found but you know
00:58:06.180 what that you found but you know what
00:58:09.300 what what wasn't found and that isn't
00:58:11.940 that doesn't mean the people below are
00:58:13.140 Crooks or anything like that it just
00:58:14.520 means that it's it's very tough with
00:58:16.920 thousands and thousands and thousands of
00:58:18.839 complicated transactions sometimes
00:58:20.819 involving the computations involving
00:58:22.740 multiple variables
00:58:24.660 it can be it can be very hard to figure
00:58:27.359 out
00:58:28.800 where things stand at any given moment
00:58:31.680 and of course when the numbers get huge
00:58:33.960 on both sides
00:58:35.700 and you get small changes in these huge
00:58:39.000 numbers they have this incredible effect
00:58:40.920 on quarterly or yearly figures because
00:58:43.140 it all comes lumped in those adjustments
00:58:45.240 come lumped in a short period of time so
00:58:48.180 I just think you have to accept the fact
00:58:50.700 that insurance
00:58:52.920 banking finance companies we've seen all
00:58:55.740 kinds of finance company uh both frauds
00:58:59.099 and and just big
00:59:00.900 big mistakes over time just one after
00:59:03.900 another over the years uh and that it's
00:59:07.140 just a more dangerous
00:59:09.240 field to analyze it doesn't mean you
00:59:11.339 can't make money and we've made a lot of
00:59:12.660 money on it but but it's it's difficult
00:59:14.579 now obviously a Geico
00:59:17.099 where you're insuring pretty much the
00:59:19.200 same thing Auto drivers and you get your
00:59:21.480 statistics are much more valid in
00:59:24.059 something like that
00:59:25.559 than they will be if you're if you're
00:59:27.540 taking something that like asbestos
00:59:30.599 liability uh
00:59:33.000 you're subject to far greater errors and
00:59:35.760 estimation doesn't mean that people
00:59:37.619 aren't operating in good faith
00:59:39.480 but you know I would take just take the
00:59:42.599 asbestos estimates of the 20 largest
00:59:44.940 insurance companies I will bet you their
00:59:46.619 way off but I don't know in which
00:59:47.819 direction and that's uh that's sort of
00:59:50.760 the nature of financial companies I
00:59:52.740 wouldn't fault the rating agencies
00:59:55.020 in terms of not being able to to dig
00:59:58.079 into the the uh
01:00:02.180 financials and find things that that uh
01:00:06.180 you know all of the companies that
01:00:08.280 you've talked about have had big name
01:00:09.480 Auditors and uh our auditors
01:00:13.140 Berkshire
01:00:14.880 how many hours did they spend last year
01:00:16.740 man I don't know whether what it would
01:00:18.059 be probably 60 70 000 hours uh and I'm
01:00:21.780 sure another you know if you take major
01:00:23.280 Banks they're spending more than that
01:00:25.799 but you know can they be certain of the
01:00:27.900 numbers I I doubt it Charlie
01:00:31.020 yeah
01:00:32.760 Warren is obviously correct that
01:00:35.760 where you've got
01:00:39.180 complexity
01:00:41.280 which by its very nature
01:00:45.000 provides better opportunities
01:00:47.460 to be mistaken and not have it come to
01:00:50.280 notice or to be fraudulent and have it
01:00:52.380 not be found out
01:00:54.000 you're going to get more frauded
01:00:55.859 mistakes than you are if you're selling
01:00:57.599 a business where you shovel sand out of
01:01:00.000 the river and sell it by the truckload
01:01:02.160 and just as a business that sells
01:01:04.740 natural gas is going to have more
01:01:06.240 explosions than a business that sells
01:01:08.700 sand a business like these major
01:01:10.799 financial institutions
01:01:12.720 by its nature is going to have way more
01:01:15.900 problems and that will always be true
01:01:17.460 and it's true when the financial
01:01:19.140 institutions are owned by governments in
01:01:21.299 fact some of the worst financial
01:01:23.299 reporting in the world is done by
01:01:25.440 governments and governments institutions
01:01:29.099 like government banks in China Etc so if
01:01:33.119 you don't like
01:01:35.280 the lack of perfect accounting and
01:01:36.900 financial institutions you're in the
01:01:38.579 wrong world
01:01:40.380 hello my name is Jeff Colbert and I'm
01:01:43.559 from Olathe Kansas
01:01:46.799 I got started in investing in 1999 right
01:01:51.059 before the big Tech bubble and
01:01:54.240 unfortunately I learned Buy and Hold and
01:01:58.500 uh
01:01:59.520 don't fret about market price
01:02:01.680 fluctuations before I learned the
01:02:03.900 importance of valuing a business and
01:02:06.660 applying a margin of safety
01:02:08.579 so as Charlie said I got my feet wet
01:02:12.240 with huge failure right away
01:02:15.720 and we're in the club
01:02:18.319 thank you I don't feel so bad now
01:02:21.780 um
01:02:23.040 so that leads to my my question it seems
01:02:26.160 like to me I've read all the Berkshire
01:02:27.900 reports and all the reading I can do
01:02:29.819 about you two and and I thank you for
01:02:32.579 these wonderful meetings but
01:02:34.980 it seems like it boils down to some
01:02:37.500 simple things valuing a business and
01:02:40.380 applying a margin of safety so my
01:02:42.960 question is what do you recommend for an
01:02:45.720 approach to getting better and better at
01:02:48.720 valuing companies
01:02:52.260 it was a very very good question
01:02:55.020 and in my own case
01:02:57.299 you know I started out without doing
01:02:59.099 anything about value in companies
01:03:01.200 and then Graham
01:03:04.440 taught me a way
01:03:06.839 to
01:03:07.700 value a certain type of company
01:03:11.400 that would prove successful
01:03:14.040 except the universe of those companies
01:03:16.079 dried up but nevertheless it it was
01:03:19.500 almost a guarantee against failure but
01:03:22.319 it wasn't it was not a guarantee that
01:03:24.119 these things would continue to be
01:03:25.559 available Charlie taught me a lot a lot
01:03:28.559 about the value of a durable competitive
01:03:30.599 advantage and and a really first class
01:03:32.940 business
01:03:34.079 but
01:03:37.619 over time
01:03:39.540 I've learned more about various types of
01:03:42.180 businesses but you do be amazed how many
01:03:44.099 businesses I don't feel that I
01:03:45.960 understand well
01:03:47.359 the biggest thing is not how big
01:03:51.059 your circle of competences but knowing
01:03:53.220 where the perimeter is if you
01:03:56.880 you don't have to be an expert on ninety
01:03:59.760 percent of the businesses or 80 or 70 or
01:04:02.099 50. but you do have to know something
01:04:05.160 about the ones that you actually put
01:04:06.480 your money into and if that's a very
01:04:07.980 small part of the universe that still is
01:04:10.500 not a killer and
01:04:13.200 I I think if you think about what you
01:04:15.900 would pay for a McDonald's stand what
01:04:17.640 you think you would pay for you know
01:04:19.680 think about the businesses in your own
01:04:21.059 hometown of it's a laughing
01:04:23.160 uh
01:04:24.660 you know which would you like
01:04:26.819 to buy and do which do you think you
01:04:28.500 could understand their economics which
01:04:30.119 do you think will be around 10 or 20
01:04:31.680 years from now which do you think it
01:04:33.180 would be very tough to compete with just
01:04:35.460 keep asking yourself questions about
01:04:37.200 businesses talk about with other people
01:04:39.240 about them you will extend your
01:04:41.460 knowledge over time and always remember
01:04:44.700 that margin of safety and I think you
01:04:47.339 basically have the right attitude
01:04:48.660 because you do you recognize your
01:04:50.579 limitations and that's enormously
01:04:52.440 important in this business you will find
01:04:54.480 things to do six or seven years ago
01:04:56.880 maybe not that long yeah six or seven
01:04:59.880 years ago when I was looking at Korean
01:05:01.740 stocks for example I never had any idea
01:05:03.720 that Korean stocks would be something
01:05:05.700 that I would be buying but I looked over
01:05:07.920 there and and I could see that there
01:05:10.500 were a number of businesses that met the
01:05:12.540 margin of safety test and they're right
01:05:15.000 Diversified because I didn't know that
01:05:16.559 much about any specific one but I knew
01:05:18.960 that a package of 20 was going to work
01:05:20.700 out very well even if a crook might run
01:05:22.680 one of them and a couple of might run
01:05:24.059 into competition I didn't anticipate
01:05:25.859 because they were so cheap
01:05:27.359 and that was sort of the old Graham
01:05:29.339 approach
01:05:30.319 you will find Opportunities from time to
01:05:32.940 time and the beauty of it is you don't
01:05:34.559 have to find very many of them currently
01:05:39.900 well obviously if you want to get good
01:05:41.940 at something
01:05:43.559 which is competitive
01:05:46.020 you have to think about it a lot and
01:05:48.480 learn a lot and practice doing it a lot
01:05:52.559 and the way the world is constructed
01:05:56.160 in this field you have to keep learning
01:05:59.760 because the world keeps changing
01:06:02.099 and your competitors keep learning
01:06:06.180 so
01:06:08.400 you just have to get up each morning and
01:06:11.940 and
01:06:12.559 try and go to bed that night a little
01:06:15.420 wiser than you were when you got up and
01:06:18.059 if you keep doing that for a long time
01:06:20.460 and
01:06:21.420 and accumulate some experience good and
01:06:23.819 bad as you try and master what you're
01:06:27.180 trying to do
01:06:29.700 people do that almost never fail utterly
01:06:32.760 they may have a bad period
01:06:35.760 when luck goes against them or something
01:06:38.220 but very few people have ever failed
01:06:40.680 with that
01:06:42.359 with that if you have the right
01:06:44.460 temperament
01:06:45.839 you may rise slowly but you you're sure
01:06:48.839 to rise
01:06:51.180 Charlie did you take any business
01:06:53.039 courses in school no I took accounting
01:06:57.119 and
01:06:58.980 when did you start valuing businesses
01:07:00.660 and how did you go about it
01:07:02.940 when I was a little boy
01:07:05.940 I can remember I would come down to the
01:07:08.520 Omaha club and it was an Old Gentleman
01:07:10.200 who hit the Omaha Club about 10 30 every
01:07:12.240 morning he obviously did almost no work
01:07:15.119 and yet was quite prosperous
01:07:17.640 he became your ideal yeah so well but he
01:07:21.599 made me very curious as a little boy I
01:07:24.480 said to my father how in the hell does
01:07:26.160 he do that
01:07:28.200 and he said Charlie he's in a business
01:07:30.119 where he enjoys practically no
01:07:31.799 competition he gathers up
01:07:33.900 and renders dead horses
01:07:37.380 well that was an example of avoiding
01:07:39.420 competition by one stratagem and
01:07:42.960 and if you keep asking questions like
01:07:45.960 that of reality
01:07:47.339 starting at a young age you gradually
01:07:49.319 learn
01:07:50.700 and where you were doing the same thing
01:07:52.619 well yeah thankfully he extrapolate he
01:07:55.020 went beyond his original
01:07:56.320 [Laughter]
01:07:57.839 insight there but
01:08:00.240 I noticed it's rather interesting
01:08:04.200 you take the rulers of the
01:08:07.079 businesses when I was a little boy
01:08:11.039 a awful lot of those business in Omaha a
01:08:14.280 lot of those businesses went broke a lot
01:08:15.900 of them sold out at modest prices under
01:08:17.698 distress
01:08:18.839 and some of the people who Rose
01:08:21.299 like key Whit from Small Beginnings
01:08:24.198 nobody thought of as the great glories
01:08:27.420 of of that early time
01:08:30.060 and I think that's kind of the way life
01:08:32.219 is
01:08:33.359 it's hard to get anywhere near the top
01:08:35.520 and it's hard to hold any position once
01:08:37.920 you've attained it
01:08:39.299 and uh
01:08:41.160 but
01:08:42.420 I think you could predict
01:08:44.580 the key what was likely to win
01:08:47.939 they cared more about doing it right
01:08:50.040 they cared more about avoiding trouble
01:08:52.738 they put more discipline on themselves
01:08:56.299 if you knew the individual well it would
01:08:59.040 have it would have been right what if
01:09:00.899 you knew the individual
01:09:02.399 beat him I would not have bet on any of
01:09:05.100 the people I knew who were already
01:09:06.540 wealthy
01:09:08.219 but I would have bet on Pete Kiewit his
01:09:10.859 sister taught me math
01:09:13.140 and and
01:09:16.500 half Dutch half German you know this is
01:09:18.600 a tough culture and there's your there
01:09:21.779 you've just heard it folks half Dutch
01:09:23.819 half German
01:09:24.979 well but go out looking for him
01:09:28.620 well the man was recommending this is
01:09:30.540 named monger and anyway the uh
01:09:35.540 uh no I I don't think it's that but if
01:09:39.779 you're
01:09:41.100 I was just automatically doing that what
01:09:43.500 was working
01:09:45.000 what was failing why was it working why
01:09:47.339 was it failing if you have that
01:09:50.759 temperament
01:09:52.259 you are gradually going to learn
01:09:54.840 and and uh if you don't have that
01:09:57.900 temperament
01:09:58.920 I can't help you
01:10:02.040 if you'd followed Peak even around for
01:10:03.960 10 years you never would have seen him
01:10:05.219 do anything dumb right oh yeah and so
01:10:10.679 it it's avoiding the dumb thing you
01:10:12.719 don't it really don't have to be
01:10:13.800 brilliant but yeah you know you have to
01:10:16.620 avoid just sort of put almost seem the
01:10:19.860 obvious mistakes but I would say that
01:10:21.960 you're on the right track back there on
01:10:23.520 the in in terms of
01:10:25.980 having the basic fundamentals knowing
01:10:28.080 your limitations but still seeking to
01:10:30.239 learn more about various kinds of
01:10:31.560 businesses surely
01:10:33.780 I think when he practiced law
01:10:38.219 any client that came in Charlie was
01:10:41.820 thinking about that businesses if he
01:10:44.219 owned the place
01:10:45.540 and he probably generally felt he knew
01:10:47.340 more about the place and the guy that
01:10:49.380 actually owned it it was it was quiet
01:10:51.199 who was the client but but I remember
01:10:54.120 talking to him
01:10:55.560 you know 50 years ago and he would start
01:10:58.140 talking about caterpillar dealerships in
01:11:00.000 Bakersfield or something of the sort it
01:11:01.679 was it was incapable of looking at a
01:11:03.540 business without thinking about the
01:11:05.040 fundamental economics of it
01:11:09.480 how'd that guy do with the caterpillar
01:11:11.040 well
01:11:13.620 he sold it for a perfectly ridiculous
01:11:15.780 price to a dumb oil company
01:11:20.280 it wasn't worth half what he got for it
01:11:22.500 yeah
01:11:23.340 but they had a concept they had a
01:11:25.620 concept in the strategy and no doubt
01:11:27.239 they had Consultants
01:11:29.040 uh
01:11:33.060 Becky
01:11:35.940 this question comes from Carson Mitchell
01:11:38.400 in Aberdeen South Dakota who asked both
01:11:40.860 of you what business has had the best
01:11:43.199 return on capital for Berkshire and what
01:11:45.360 business of any on Earth has had the
01:11:47.460 best return on Capital and he adds PS I
01:11:50.580 would have come by rail but there are no
01:11:52.199 seats in the grain rail cars
01:11:54.960 they
01:11:57.420 there's two ways of looking at it if you
01:11:59.280 talk about the capital necessary to run
01:12:01.860 the business as opposed to what we might
01:12:04.260 have paid for the business I mean the
01:12:06.840 if we buy a wonderful business you could
01:12:09.000 run the Coca-Cola Company assuming you
01:12:11.100 had the bottling systems ever you could
01:12:12.540 run it with no capital
01:12:14.100 yet now
01:12:16.260 if you buy it for 100 billion dollars I
01:12:19.199 mean you can look at that as your
01:12:20.580 capital or you can look at the basic
01:12:21.900 Capital we when we look at what's a good
01:12:24.060 business we're defining it in terms of
01:12:27.000 the capital actually needed in the
01:12:28.679 business whether it's a good investment
01:12:30.420 for us depends on how much we pay for
01:12:31.920 that in the end
01:12:33.540 there are a number of businesses
01:12:36.179 that operate on negative capital
01:12:38.580 uh
01:12:40.620 Carol's with Fortune Magazine you know
01:12:43.260 any any of the great magazines
01:12:46.140 and
01:12:47.480 operate with negative capital I mean
01:12:50.159 they those subscribers pay in advance
01:12:52.020 there are no fixed assets to speak of
01:12:54.600 and and the receivables are not that
01:12:56.940 much the inventory is nothing so
01:12:59.880 a magazine business my guess is that
01:13:03.239 People magazine operates or Sports
01:13:05.280 illustrate Opera Sports illustrator
01:13:07.860 operate with negative capital
01:13:09.780 and
01:13:11.159 particularly people make a lot of money
01:13:14.659 so there are certain businesses well we
01:13:18.360 had a company called Blue Chip Stamps
01:13:19.980 that that where we got the float ahead
01:13:22.020 of time and operated with
01:13:25.320 really substantial negative Capital uh
01:13:29.340 but there are a lot of great businesses
01:13:31.260 uh
01:13:32.159 that need very very little Capital Apple
01:13:35.580 doesn't need that much Capital that you
01:13:38.100 know that uh
01:13:40.199 the best ones of course are the ones
01:13:42.179 that can get very large while needing no
01:13:44.640 Capital C's is a wonderful business
01:13:46.440 needs very little capital
01:13:48.360 but it we can't get people eating 10
01:13:51.659 pounds of of boxed chocolates every day
01:13:54.480 except here we want to uh
01:14:01.400 generally the great consumer businesses
01:14:05.040 need relatively little Capital uh
01:14:09.659 um
01:14:11.520 the the businesses where people pay you
01:14:14.219 in advance you know magazines of
01:14:16.140 Christians being a case Insurance being
01:14:18.239 a case
01:14:19.260 uh you know you're using you're using
01:14:22.620 your customers capital
01:14:24.300 uh and we like those kind of businesses
01:14:28.380 but of course so does the rest of the
01:14:29.760 world so they can become very
01:14:31.320 competitive and and buying them we have
01:14:34.500 a business for example this won't run
01:14:36.900 wonderfully uh like Catherine Kathy
01:14:40.260 Barron Tamara it's called Business Wire
01:14:41.880 Business Wire does not require a lot of
01:14:44.040 capital that has receivables and
01:14:45.900 everything but it is a service type
01:14:47.460 business and many of the service type
01:14:49.560 businesses and consumer type businesses
01:14:51.600 require a little capital and when they
01:14:53.580 get to be successful
01:14:55.440 you know they can really be something uh
01:14:57.960 Charlie
01:15:00.780 I've got nothing to add but
01:15:03.840 at any rate the the formula never
01:15:06.659 changes
01:15:11.400 if you get all if you could own one
01:15:13.260 business in the world what would it be
01:15:14.640 Charlie
01:15:23.159 I hope I already own them myself
01:15:26.340 you and I got in trouble by addressing
01:15:28.620 such a subject many decades that's right
01:15:30.739 I don't think I'll come back to it okay
01:15:34.400 number 13. if you name some business
01:15:38.040 that has incredible pricing power you're
01:15:40.860 talking about a business that's a
01:15:42.300 monopoly or a near Monopoly sure and I
01:15:45.000 don't think it's very smart for us to
01:15:46.500 sit up here
01:15:48.300 naming is our most admired business is
01:15:50.760 something that other people regard as a
01:15:52.800 monopoly okay we'll move right along
01:15:59.340 Brian Zen from China
01:16:02.100 as a Coke addict myself I'm excited to
01:16:05.340 report to you our worldwide promoter in
01:16:08.460 Chief
01:16:09.600 that the cokes in Beijing taste just as
01:16:12.480 wonderful as in Omaha
01:16:15.300 as ex-zen monk today I feel like
01:16:18.000 visiting the Buddha of the financial
01:16:19.560 world we have the investment club with a
01:16:22.920 name that ends in.com believe it or not
01:16:26.340 which tells you that the frenzy
01:16:29.040 .com friends even seduced Zen monks when
01:16:33.300 we try to follow you
01:16:35.460 we find that Mrs Susan Buffett used to
01:16:38.940 send Zen Buddhism books to her sorority
01:16:41.280 sisters that's probably why she always
01:16:43.980 has a peaceful smile due to her low
01:16:46.739 expectation of Life which according to
01:16:49.140 Buddha is full of sufferings
01:16:51.780 but Mr Monger would tell me that Susan's
01:16:55.080 smile is because you as the husband
01:16:57.440 exceeded her low expectations that's
01:17:00.780 right
01:17:02.400 yeah
01:17:04.020 and her father's even lower expectations
01:17:09.540 anyway
01:17:10.800 um my question is uh did Susan also send
01:17:13.800 those Zen books to your office or your
01:17:16.260 bedroom and if you have read those books
01:17:18.540 what are the key ideas that contributed
01:17:21.360 to your investment Tau which even made
01:17:24.540 sense to secluded narrow-minded Zen
01:17:27.659 monks like me thanks for the financial
01:17:30.380 enlightenments you've given us today
01:17:32.400 thank you I sent those books on to
01:17:34.860 Charlie so I'll let him answer
01:17:40.800 actually I tend to be a follower of
01:17:43.020 Confucius
01:17:46.679 and
01:17:49.140 I think this room is full of Confucian
01:17:51.300 values
01:17:52.620 you know if the first law of
01:17:54.659 Confucianism is filial piety
01:17:56.840 particularly toward the elderly males
01:17:59.340 you can see why I like that system
01:18:06.360 area four
01:18:07.670 [Laughter]
01:18:12.239 good afternoon Mr Buffett Mr Munger my
01:18:15.060 name is Kevin Truitt from Chicago I have
01:18:17.400 three questions for you
01:18:19.080 Mr Munger at last year's shareholder
01:18:21.719 meeting you stated that you didn't feel
01:18:24.480 that the concept of the cost of capital
01:18:26.820 made True economic sense
01:18:29.699 would you explain why you felt this way
01:18:32.820 and what you would do to replace it with
01:18:36.480 anything
01:18:37.679 my second question is to Mr Buffett
01:18:40.080 you've stated the importance of an
01:18:42.480 occasional big idea how were you able to
01:18:45.540 in fact tell when you had a big idea
01:18:49.980 and my third question Mr Buffett you
01:18:53.100 have talked about the importance of the
01:18:55.260 franchise and sustainable competitive
01:18:57.840 advantage
01:18:59.159 companies like Kellogg and Campbell Soup
01:19:01.860 are companies that most people would
01:19:04.380 have said had those qualities
01:19:07.620 however over time those qualities were
01:19:11.460 lost as a result of a change in consumer
01:19:14.699 taste
01:19:15.900 what gives you confidence that the same
01:19:18.840 things won't happen to Coke or Gillette
01:19:25.500 well caution Capital cost of capital
01:19:28.380 first
01:19:31.040 obviously considerations of cost are
01:19:33.960 important in business
01:19:35.880 and obviously
01:19:37.580 opportunity costs which is a doctrine of
01:19:40.920 economics really a doctrine of
01:19:42.960 lifemanship are also very important
01:19:46.739 and we've always had
01:19:49.260 that kind of basic thinking
01:19:52.020 uh
01:19:53.820 of course Capital isn't free
01:19:56.280 and of course
01:19:59.420 you can figure cost of capital when
01:20:01.920 you're borrowing money or at least you
01:20:03.900 can figure cost of loans
01:20:06.960 but
01:20:08.280 the theorists had to develop some theory
01:20:11.100 for what Equity cost
01:20:14.100 and there they just went bonkers
01:20:17.880 they
01:20:19.199 they said if you earned 100 on Capital
01:20:21.420 because you had some marvelous business
01:20:23.699 your cost of capital was a hundred
01:20:25.440 percent and therefore you shouldn't look
01:20:27.659 at any opportunity that delivered a
01:20:29.699 lousy 80 percent
01:20:31.739 that is the kind of thinking which came
01:20:33.840 out of the capital assets pricing models
01:20:36.000 and so forth that I've always considered
01:20:38.820 inanity
01:20:40.199 what is berkshire's cost of capital
01:20:44.580 we have this damn capital
01:20:46.860 it just keeps multiplying and
01:20:48.540 multiplying
01:20:49.980 what does its cost
01:20:53.600 you have perfectly good
01:20:56.940 old-fashioned doctrines like opportunity
01:20:59.159 cost you know at any given time when we
01:21:03.120 consider an investment we have to
01:21:05.280 compare it to the best alternative
01:21:07.199 investment we have at that time we had
01:21:09.780 perfectly good old-fashioned ideas that
01:21:11.880 are very basic to use but they weren't
01:21:13.980 good enough for these modern theaters so
01:21:16.560 they invented all this ridiculous
01:21:19.440 mathematics
01:21:21.540 which
01:21:23.460 concluded that they companies that made
01:21:26.400 the most money had the highest cost of
01:21:28.020 capital
01:21:29.699 well all I can say is this not for us
01:21:31.860 now the other half of that question I
01:21:33.719 leave for Mr Butler
01:21:35.880 yeah what what you find of course is
01:21:37.800 that
01:21:38.940 the cost of capital is about
01:21:41.820 a quarter percent below
01:21:44.280 the return promised by any deal that the
01:21:46.560 CEO wants to do very simple
01:21:49.620 it uh you know we have three questions
01:21:52.500 on Capital at the the with capitals
01:21:54.840 around and
01:21:55.920 leaving aside whether we want to borrow
01:21:57.540 money which we generally don't want to
01:21:59.280 do and
01:22:00.420 one is does it make it more sense to pay
01:22:02.400 it out to the shareholders
01:22:04.020 than to keep it within the company
01:22:06.360 sub question on that is if we pay it out
01:22:08.580 is it better off to do it by our
01:22:10.140 repurchases or by a dividend
01:22:12.480 the test for whether
01:22:14.580 we pay it out in dividends is can we
01:22:16.800 create more than a dollar of value
01:22:18.120 within the company
01:22:19.620 uh with that dollar then paying it out
01:22:22.080 and you never know the answer to that
01:22:24.360 but so far the answer is judged by
01:22:26.040 results is yes we can and we think that
01:22:29.100 perspectively we can but that's that's a
01:22:31.560 let's say uh you know that's a Hope on
01:22:35.040 our part and it's Justified to some
01:22:36.960 extent by past history but it's not a
01:22:39.360 certainty
01:22:40.320 once we've crossed that threshold
01:22:42.960 then do we repurchase stock well
01:22:44.760 obviously if you can buy your stock at a
01:22:46.380 significant discount from
01:22:48.500 conservatively calculated intrinsic
01:22:50.699 value and you can buy it in reasonable
01:22:52.140 quantity that's a use for Capital
01:22:54.179 beyond that then the question becomes if
01:22:57.060 you have the capital you think you can
01:22:58.440 create more than a dollar how do you
01:22:59.760 create the most with the least risk and
01:23:02.219 that gets to business risk it doesn't
01:23:03.780 get to any calculation of the volatility
01:23:05.520 I don't know the the risk in See's Candy
01:23:08.760 is measured by its stock volatility
01:23:11.040 because the stock hasn't been
01:23:12.179 outstanding since 1972 does that mean I
01:23:14.520 can't determine how risky a business
01:23:16.500 sees is because if we don't have a daily
01:23:18.179 quote on it no I can determine it by
01:23:20.219 looking at the business and the
01:23:22.260 competitive environment which it
01:23:23.640 operates and so on so
01:23:26.300 once we
01:23:28.020 cross the threshold
01:23:30.360 of deciding that we can deploy
01:23:34.500 Capital so as to create more than a
01:23:36.719 dollar of present value
01:23:38.719 for every dollar retained
01:23:41.580 then it's just a question of doing the
01:23:43.560 most intelligent thing that you can find
01:23:45.060 and
01:23:47.460 you know that is
01:23:49.320 the cost of every deal we do is measured
01:23:51.659 by the second best deal that's around at
01:23:54.360 a given time including more doing more
01:23:56.219 of some of the things we're we're
01:23:57.840 already in
01:23:59.219 and
01:24:01.080 I have listened to cost of capital
01:24:02.699 discussions at all kinds of corporate
01:24:05.159 board meetings and everything else and
01:24:06.420 and you know I've never found anything
01:24:08.219 that made very much sense in it except
01:24:10.500 for the fact that that is what they
01:24:12.840 learned in business school and that's
01:24:14.219 what the Consultants talked about and
01:24:15.900 and and most of the board members would
01:24:18.360 nod their head without knowing what the
01:24:19.679 hell was going on and that's been my
01:24:22.380 history with the cost of capital now
01:24:23.960 moving on to the Big Ideas you know when
01:24:27.179 you've got a big idea and I can't tell
01:24:29.219 you
01:24:29.940 you know exactly what happens within
01:24:32.219 your nervous system or uh brain at that
01:24:35.400 time but
01:24:36.600 uh
01:24:39.600 we've had a relatively few Big Ideas
01:24:42.480 good ideas over the years I don't know
01:24:45.300 how many you think we've had in
01:24:46.199 aggregate probably
01:24:47.340 in career maybe 25 each you took the top
01:24:50.219 15 out of Berkshire Hathaway most of you
01:24:52.800 people wouldn't be here
01:24:57.179 so roughly one every two years yeah one
01:24:59.699 every year or two men
01:25:01.500 sometimes there'll be a bunch of them
01:25:03.000 like in 1973 and four
01:25:06.060 but
01:25:09.300 the problem is for us is that big now
01:25:11.640 really means big I mean it it has to be
01:25:14.640 billions of dollars to to move the
01:25:17.219 needle very much at Berkshire uh
01:25:21.840 but I I would say that
01:25:24.600 when I would turn those pages
01:25:26.820 50 years ago in the Moody's manuals I
01:25:30.000 would know when I hit a big idea I've
01:25:32.520 got half a dozen of them that I keep the
01:25:35.219 xeroxes from those reports around uh
01:25:37.980 from 50 years ago just because it was so
01:25:40.199 obvious that they they just
01:25:42.480 they were incredible and that happens
01:25:45.120 every now and then when I met when I met
01:25:47.460 Romer Davidson you know and
01:25:50.340 end of January 1951 and he spent four
01:25:53.520 hours or five hours with me explaining
01:25:55.199 Geico I knew it was a big idea
01:25:58.199 eight months later or probably 10 months
01:26:00.659 later I wrote an article
01:26:02.699 to the commercial Financial chronic on
01:26:04.380 the security I like best it was a big
01:26:05.880 idea when I found Western Insurance
01:26:07.139 Securities I knew it was a big idea they
01:26:09.600 you know I couldn't put billion millions
01:26:11.400 of dollars into it but I didn't have
01:26:12.600 millions so it didn't make any
01:26:13.620 difference and I we've seen things
01:26:15.480 subsequently and we'll see
01:26:18.120 you know we if we have a normal lifespan
01:26:21.300 we'll see we'll see a few more before we
01:26:23.280 get done but I I can't tell you that uh
01:26:26.719 exactly how
01:26:29.159 I I can't tell you exactly what
01:26:30.659 transpires in my mind that
01:26:32.880 that says uh you know flashes of neon
01:26:35.280 sign up that says this is a big idea
01:26:36.840 what happens with you Charlie
01:26:45.120 actually one of my well I have a real
01:26:47.159 system
01:26:49.199 my idea of a truly big idea is one I get
01:26:52.199 and I call Charlie and he only says no
01:26:54.060 rather than that's the worst idea I've
01:26:55.739 ever heard of but if he just says no
01:26:57.659 it's a hell of an idea
01:27:01.679 mm-hmm
01:27:03.320 you know the game in our kind of life
01:27:07.320 is
01:27:08.760 being able to recognize a good idea when
01:27:11.340 you rarely
01:27:12.719 get it
01:27:14.100 and uh we're rarely is presented to you
01:27:19.139 and I think that's something you have to
01:27:20.639 prepare for over a long period
01:27:23.340 what is the old saying that opportunity
01:27:25.380 comes to the prepared mind
01:27:28.139 and
01:27:29.699 I don't think you can teach people and
01:27:33.179 two minutes how to have a prepared mind
01:27:37.560 but that's the game
01:27:40.980 things we learned 40 years ago though
01:27:43.020 will
01:27:44.100 help
01:27:45.179 and recognize the next big idea an on
01:27:48.780 opportunity cost going back to that
01:27:51.120 the current freshman
01:27:53.540 economics text which is sweeping the
01:27:57.000 country
01:27:57.960 has write in practically the first page
01:28:00.120 and it says all intelligent people
01:28:03.480 should think primarily in terms of
01:28:05.400 opportunity cost
01:28:08.219 and that's obviously correct
01:28:10.679 but it's very hard to teach business
01:28:13.580 based on opportunity cost
01:28:16.020 it's much easier to teach the capital
01:28:18.179 assets pricing model where you can just
01:28:21.480 punch in numbers and outcome numbers and
01:28:24.840 therefore people teach what is easy to
01:28:27.000 teach instead of what is correct to
01:28:29.159 teach it reminds me of Einstein's famous
01:28:32.699 saying he says everything should be made
01:28:34.860 as simple as possible but no more simple
01:28:40.080 write that down
01:28:45.120 interesting question about franchises
01:28:46.860 too I mentioned Campbell's Soup and
01:28:49.080 Kellogg and and
01:28:51.659 you know I I am no expert on that but I
01:28:54.120 would say that that just based on
01:28:57.659 on
01:28:59.940 my general observation over the years is
01:29:02.699 that the problems there came from two
01:29:04.860 different things I think that the
01:29:06.239 problems when
01:29:07.739 with cereal ready to eat cereal
01:29:10.980 were not so much changes in taster
01:29:13.520 consumption patterns but I think they
01:29:15.840 may just push their
01:29:17.460 push their pricing too far to the point
01:29:19.620 that they they lost market share without
01:29:24.120 getting in without having the molt that
01:29:27.360 they thought they had as opposed to the
01:29:29.760 General Mills cereals and the general
01:29:31.320 food cereals and all of that sort of
01:29:33.060 thing I mean if your pricing really gets
01:29:35.219 out of whack
01:29:36.239 and people regard
01:29:38.159 uh Wheaties or or or great months in the
01:29:42.600 same categories that write regard
01:29:44.040 Kellogg's Corn Flakes you know you're
01:29:45.840 going to lose share and once you start
01:29:47.219 losing shares it it's hard to get back
01:29:50.159 problems with soup I think relate more
01:29:52.380 to Lifestyle I think that it's become
01:29:55.739 it's a it's a little less uh
01:30:00.239 it fits in a little less well with with
01:30:03.239 uh current Lifestyles maybe than 40
01:30:05.460 years ago
01:30:06.840 uh soft drinks
01:30:09.060 uh
01:30:10.679 the consumption of soft drinks
01:30:14.040 I don't have the figures here but I
01:30:16.199 would
01:30:17.219 wager that in a hundred and
01:30:19.920 10 years the per capita soft drinks has
01:30:22.260 gone up virtually every year
01:30:24.620 throughout that history I mean it it's
01:30:27.840 now 30 close to 30 percent
01:30:30.840 of U.S consumption of of liquids
01:30:34.679 so if the average American has about 64
01:30:37.560 ounces of liquids a day
01:30:39.659 you're talking about
01:30:42.000 say 18 ounces of that
01:30:45.000 being soft drinks and 43 percent of that
01:30:48.000 18
01:30:49.080 or almost eight ounces a day
01:30:51.719 of being Coca-Cola products
01:30:54.300 in other words 1 8 of all the liquid man
01:30:58.260 woman and child of the United States
01:31:00.719 take in
01:31:02.460 comes from Coca-Cola products but that
01:31:04.440 has gone up
01:31:05.520 virtually well throughout the world
01:31:07.920 that's gone up on a per capita basis
01:31:10.800 you know almost in soft drinks were
01:31:12.659 discovered that people I would say that
01:31:15.420 that
01:31:18.360 trend is almost
01:31:20.639 impossible to reverse on a worldwide
01:31:22.800 basis I mean there's so much potential
01:31:26.639 in countries where
01:31:28.500 per capita consumption
01:31:31.080 it's like
01:31:32.940 well I think it's
01:31:34.679 I don't know maybe eight per capita
01:31:36.540 which is eight ounce servings they talk
01:31:38.219 in terms of 64 ounces a year
01:31:41.540 so you have one
01:31:43.920 50th of the consumption per capita
01:31:46.739 on Coke products and many in some
01:31:49.080 important countries that you have here I
01:31:51.420 don't I just don't see it as being now
01:31:53.880 it you can push pricing too far I mean
01:31:56.400 there there comes a point depends on the
01:31:58.500 country in which you're doing it but and
01:32:00.239 it depends even on areas within the
01:32:02.639 country in which you do it but if you
01:32:04.620 establish too wide a differential
01:32:07.139 between uh Coke
01:32:10.260 and and a private label product you will
01:32:13.080 change consumption patterns somewhat not
01:32:16.199 huge but enough so that you don't want
01:32:17.940 to do it
01:32:18.960 but I don't think I don't think you'll
01:32:21.060 see
01:32:21.960 it's interesting coffee's going down
01:32:23.580 every year people talk about Starbucks
01:32:24.900 and all that but if you look at Coffee
01:32:26.280 consumption in this country if you look
01:32:27.659 at male consumption in the country you
01:32:29.520 know per capita just goes down down down
01:32:31.380 down year after year after year after
01:32:33.120 year and uh
01:32:35.639 I think it's pretty clear what
01:32:37.800 people like to drink once they get used
01:32:39.540 to it and with the price
01:32:42.780 is when I was born in 1930 a six and a
01:32:45.360 half ounce Coke
01:32:46.800 cost a nickel and you put a two two cent
01:32:48.960 deposit on the bottle but forget about
01:32:50.520 that just take the nickel now you buy a
01:32:53.159 12 ounce can or a larger product and
01:32:55.800 you're you're paying as you buy it on
01:32:58.679 the weekends at the supermarket specials
01:33:00.540 I'm you're paying
01:33:02.699 maybe a little more than twice
01:33:05.820 per ounce what you were paying in 1930
01:33:08.580 70 years ago and compare that to the
01:33:10.739 price behavior of almost any product
01:33:12.960 you know that you can find except for
01:33:14.760 all Commodities but compared to cars
01:33:17.219 housing anything and it there's been
01:33:20.520 very very little price inflation in it
01:33:22.620 and I think that's contributed of course
01:33:24.239 to the the growth and per capita's over
01:33:26.040 time Charlie how about cereals and soup
01:33:31.440 well I think those are examples where
01:33:33.600 the
01:33:34.800 moats got less
01:33:36.980 uh hostile for the competitors
01:33:42.000 part of the trouble was the
01:33:46.500 the buying power got more concentrated
01:33:49.260 and tougher
01:33:51.360 I mean the big grocery chains now have a
01:33:53.699 lot of clout and then you add the
01:33:55.739 Walmarts and the Costcos and the Sams
01:33:58.679 and the
01:34:00.000 it just it's a different world faced by
01:34:02.340 the Kellogg's than the one they had
01:34:04.679 30 or 40 years ago yeah there will be a
01:34:07.800 battle always between Brands and
01:34:09.600 retailers because the retailer would
01:34:11.820 like
01:34:13.199 his name to be the brand
01:34:15.840 and to the extent that people trust
01:34:19.260 Costco or Walmart more than they or as
01:34:21.900 much as they trust the brand then the
01:34:23.580 value of having the brand moves over
01:34:26.219 to the retailer
01:34:28.080 from the product itself and that's gone
01:34:31.020 on for a long long time I you know the
01:34:32.880 first I would
01:34:34.980 cases I know about in any real quantity
01:34:37.139 back with a p
01:34:39.600 in the 30s and a p I believe was was the
01:34:43.320 largest food retailer in this country
01:34:45.300 and they were also a big promoter of
01:34:47.280 private labels and Paige I think was was
01:34:50.219 a big private label with them for
01:34:52.020 example and and they
01:34:54.360 felt they could
01:34:56.820 convince the consumer in the 30s
01:35:00.300 that their brand meant more
01:35:02.880 than having Del Monte on it or or or
01:35:05.420 Campbells or whatever it might be in the
01:35:07.620 different categories and
01:35:09.600 and people thought they were going to
01:35:11.280 win that war for a while but it
01:35:13.380 and who knows I mean I don't know all
01:35:15.060 the variables that went into the amps
01:35:18.239 decline but it was dramatic I mean it
01:35:21.000 was one of it was a great American
01:35:22.980 success story for a while and then it
01:35:24.600 was a great American failure Charlie
01:35:26.900 the muscle power
01:35:29.840 of the Sam's Clubs and the Costcos has
01:35:33.659 gotten very extreme a little earlier
01:35:35.340 this morning when I was autographing
01:35:37.080 books a very good looking woman came up
01:35:40.080 to me and said she wanted to thank me
01:35:41.880 and I said For What and she said you
01:35:44.760 told me to buy this pantyhose I'm
01:35:48.179 wearing from Costco
01:35:49.980 and
01:35:51.060 evidently made some previous comment
01:35:53.940 about
01:35:55.739 how amazing it was that Costco could be
01:35:58.199 at Haines of all people to allow a
01:36:01.139 co-branded pantyhose
01:36:04.340 Haynes Dash Kirkland in the Costco
01:36:07.440 stores
01:36:08.760 that wouldn't have happened 20 years ago
01:36:11.100 she must have been pretty desperate as
01:36:12.960 she was consoling with you on where to
01:36:14.699 buy pantyhose
01:36:19.320 okay
01:36:24.199 and we'll start just one second
01:36:26.400 everybody has a chance to get to their
01:36:27.900 seats
01:36:31.380 Charlie has promised to stop tapping the
01:36:33.659 Coke can during this session
01:36:43.620 number two okay
01:36:47.040 I used to have a friend that was a stock
01:36:48.840 salesman many years ago and
01:36:51.060 when you'd have lunch with him he would
01:36:52.679 just keep going like this
01:36:55.080 and finally I would get to you and say
01:36:56.639 what's that and he said that's
01:36:58.080 opportunity
01:36:58.730 [Laughter]
01:37:03.120 he was pretty good
01:37:05.880 okay let's uh
01:37:07.980 Kelly tells me we should start with uh
01:37:10.199 with number two zone two so we're going
01:37:12.900 to start with zone two
01:37:17.840 yes I'm uh Fred cooker from Boulder
01:37:21.600 Colorado
01:37:23.040 and this is a question about intrinsic
01:37:26.340 value and it's a question for both of
01:37:28.260 you because you have written that
01:37:29.880 perhaps you would come up with different
01:37:32.580 answers
01:37:33.900 you uh
01:37:35.580 write and speak a great deal about
01:37:38.219 intrinsic value
01:37:40.280 and you indicate that you try to give
01:37:42.900 shareholders the tools
01:37:45.480 in the annual report so they can come to
01:37:47.820 their own determination
01:37:50.040 what I'd like you to do is expand upon
01:37:52.320 that a little bit
01:37:54.780 first of all what
01:37:57.360 what do you believe to be the important
01:37:59.940 tools either in the Berkshire annual
01:38:02.159 report or other annual reports that you
01:38:05.100 review
01:38:06.860 in determining intrinsic value and
01:38:10.560 secondly
01:38:12.000 what
01:38:13.380 rules or principles or standards do you
01:38:17.639 use in applying those tools
01:38:21.179 and lastly
01:38:23.159 how does that process that is the use of
01:38:26.100 the tools the application of the
01:38:28.020 standards relate to what you have
01:38:30.420 previously described as the filters you
01:38:34.560 use in determining your valuation of a
01:38:37.500 company
01:38:41.400 if we
01:38:44.760 could see
01:38:46.679 in it looking at any business
01:38:49.739 what it's
01:38:51.179 future cash
01:38:53.340 inflows or outflows from the business to
01:38:55.739 the owners or from the owners
01:38:58.380 would be over the next
01:39:00.480 we'll call it a hundred years or until
01:39:02.940 the business is extinct
01:39:06.600 and then could discount that back
01:39:09.239 at the appropriate interest rate well
01:39:11.159 which I'll get to in a second
01:39:13.739 uh that would give us a number for
01:39:16.139 intrinsic value
01:39:17.699 in other words it would be like looking
01:39:19.080 at a bond
01:39:20.639 that had a whole bunch of coupons on it
01:39:22.380 that was doing 100 years and if you
01:39:24.060 could see what those coupons are you can
01:39:25.620 figure the value of that Bond
01:39:28.139 compared to government bonds if you want
01:39:31.020 to stick an appropriate risk rate in or
01:39:33.420 you can compare one government bond with
01:39:35.040 five percent coupons to another
01:39:36.360 Government Bond with seven percent
01:39:37.679 coupons each one of those bonds has a
01:39:39.420 different value because they have
01:39:40.500 different coupons printed on them
01:39:42.300 businesses have coupons that are going
01:39:44.219 to develop in the future too the only
01:39:45.840 problem is they aren't printed on the
01:39:47.280 instrument and it's up to the investor
01:39:50.219 to try to estimate what those coupons
01:39:52.620 are going to be over time
01:39:55.620 as we have said in high-tech businesses
01:39:57.719 or something like that we don't know the
01:39:59.040 faintest idea what the coupons are going
01:40:00.659 to be when we get into businesses where
01:40:02.580 we think we can understand them
01:40:03.719 reasonably well we are trying to print
01:40:05.400 the coupons out we were trying to figure
01:40:06.719 out what businesses are going to be
01:40:07.860 worth in 10 or 20 years when we bought
01:40:09.960 See's Candy in 1972
01:40:12.360 we had to come to the Judgment as to
01:40:14.040 whether we could
01:40:16.260 figure out the competitive forces that
01:40:18.840 would operate the strengths and
01:40:20.100 weaknesses of the company and and how
01:40:21.719 that would look over a 10 or 20 or 30
01:40:24.300 year period
01:40:25.560 and
01:40:27.420 if you
01:40:29.340 attempt to assess intrinsic value it all
01:40:32.040 relates to cash flows the only reason
01:40:33.540 for putting cash into any kind of an
01:40:35.639 investment now is because you expect to
01:40:37.500 take cash out not by selling it to
01:40:39.780 somebody else because that's just a game
01:40:41.639 of who beats who but by in a sense by
01:40:44.639 what the asset itself produces that's
01:40:46.560 true if you're buying a farm it's true
01:40:48.179 if you're buying
01:40:49.380 if you're buying a business
01:40:51.179 and
01:40:52.860 the filters you described were there are
01:40:55.560 a number of filters
01:40:56.940 which say to us
01:40:58.560 we don't know what that business is
01:40:59.880 going to be worth in in 10 or 20 years
01:41:02.100 and we can't even make an educated yes
01:41:03.719 obviously we don't think we know
01:41:06.239 the three decimal places or two decimal
01:41:08.159 places or anything what like that what
01:41:10.620 precisely what's going to be produced
01:41:12.360 but we have a high degree of confidence
01:41:14.040 that we're in the ballpark with certain
01:41:16.020 kinds of businesses the fillers are
01:41:18.420 designed to make sure we're in those
01:41:19.679 kinds of businesses
01:41:21.239 we basically use
01:41:23.760 long-term
01:41:25.380 risk-free that's Government Bond type
01:41:28.260 interest rates to think back in terms of
01:41:30.360 what we should discount at uh and you
01:41:33.840 know that's that's what the game of
01:41:34.980 investment is all about investment is
01:41:36.900 putting out money to get more money back
01:41:38.580 later later on from the asset and and
01:41:40.800 not by selling it to somebody else but
01:41:43.020 by what the asset itself will produce if
01:41:45.540 you're an investor you're looking at
01:41:47.460 what the asset you're looking at what
01:41:49.139 the asset is going to do in our case
01:41:50.760 businesses
01:41:52.080 if you're a Speculator you're primarily
01:41:54.420 focusing on what the price of the object
01:41:57.000 is going to do independent of the
01:41:58.500 business and that's not our game so we
01:42:01.980 figure if we're right about the business
01:42:03.119 we're going to make we're going to make
01:42:04.560 a lot of money and if we're wrong about
01:42:05.880 the business we don't have any hopes we
01:42:07.739 we don't expect to make money and and in
01:42:10.560 looking at Berkshire
01:42:12.119 we try to tell you as much as possible
01:42:13.980 as we can about our business of the key
01:42:15.719 factors those are the things that
01:42:17.159 Charlie and I what the things we put in
01:42:18.480 our report about those businesses are
01:42:20.460 the things that we look at ourselves
01:42:23.840 so if Charlie
01:42:26.880 had nothing to do with Berkshire but he
01:42:29.400 looked at our report
01:42:31.020 he would probably in my view he would
01:42:33.239 come to pretty much the same idea of
01:42:35.040 intrinsic value that he would come to uh
01:42:37.739 for being around it and you know for X
01:42:40.440 number of years the information should
01:42:42.960 be there we give you the information
01:42:43.980 that if the positions were reversed we
01:42:46.320 would want to get from you and in
01:42:49.619 companies like Coca-Cola or Gillette or
01:42:52.440 Disney or those kind of businesses you
01:42:54.719 will see the information in the reports
01:42:56.460 you have to have some understanding of
01:42:57.659 what they're doing but you have that in
01:42:59.520 your everyday activities you'll get that
01:43:01.800 you'll get that kind of knowledge yeah
01:43:04.199 you won't get it you know in terms of
01:43:05.639 some high-tech company but you'll get it
01:43:07.020 with those kind of companies and then
01:43:08.100 you sit down and you you try to print
01:43:10.020 out the future Charlie
01:43:13.500 I would argue that one filter that's
01:43:15.900 useful in investing
01:43:18.659 it's the simple idea of opportunity cost
01:43:21.600 if you have
01:43:24.000 one opportunity that you
01:43:26.340 already have available in large quantity
01:43:28.920 and you like it better than
01:43:31.500 98 of the other things you see where you
01:43:34.619 can just screen out the other 98 percent
01:43:37.560 because you already know something
01:43:38.760 better
01:43:39.719 so that people who have a lot of
01:43:41.580 opportunities tend to make better
01:43:43.020 Investments than
01:43:46.860 people that don't have a lot of
01:43:48.300 opportunities and and people will have
01:43:50.400 very good opportunities
01:43:52.380 and using a concept of opportunity costs
01:43:55.260 they can make better decisions
01:43:57.719 about
01:43:58.920 what to buy with this attitude you get a
01:44:01.800 concentrated portfolio
01:44:04.020 which we don't mind
01:44:06.780 that
01:44:08.580 practice of ours which is so simple
01:44:11.940 is not widely copied
01:44:14.699 I do not know why now it's copied Among
01:44:16.800 The Berkshire shareholders I mean all
01:44:18.300 you people have learned it but it's not
01:44:20.820 the standard in Investment Management
01:44:22.320 even at Great universities and other
01:44:25.020 intellectual institutions
01:44:28.020 very interesting question if we're right
01:44:30.960 why are so many eminent places so wrong
01:44:37.619 there are several possible answers to
01:44:39.600 that question yeah the
01:44:41.630 [Laughter]
01:44:45.719 the attitude though I mean if somebody
01:44:48.239 shows us a business
01:44:50.340 you know the first thing goes through
01:44:51.420 our head
01:44:53.159 is would we rather
01:44:55.679 own this business and more Coca-Cola
01:44:57.480 would we rather own it than more
01:44:58.739 Gillette
01:44:59.639 now we it's it's crazy not to compare it
01:45:02.580 to things that you're very certain of
01:45:04.139 there's very few businesses that we'll
01:45:05.520 find that we're certain of the future
01:45:06.780 about as as companies such as that
01:45:10.139 and therefore
01:45:13.080 we will we will want companies where the
01:45:15.900 certainty gets close to that
01:45:18.060 uh and then we'll want to figure that
01:45:20.239 we're better off than just buying more
01:45:22.500 of those if every management
01:45:24.900 uh before they bought a business
01:45:27.480 uh and some unrelated field that they
01:45:30.239 might not have even heard of you know
01:45:31.500 more than a short time before that's
01:45:33.420 being promoted to them if they said is
01:45:36.239 this better than buying in our own stock
01:45:38.460 you know is this better than even buying
01:45:41.159 you know buying Coca-Cola stock or
01:45:42.840 something there'd be a lot fewer deals
01:45:44.639 done but but they don't they tend not to
01:45:47.280 measure uh
01:45:49.380 against what we regard as as close to
01:45:51.780 Perfection as we can get
01:45:55.320 Charlie anyone
01:45:58.560 well I will say this that the concept of
01:46:01.619 intrinsic value used to be a lot easier
01:46:04.679 because there were all kinds of stocks
01:46:07.560 that we're selling for 50 percent or
01:46:10.619 less
01:46:11.520 of the amount at which you could have
01:46:13.739 easily liquidated the whole Corporation
01:46:16.080 if you own the whole Corporation
01:46:18.119 indeed in the history of Berkshire
01:46:19.920 Hathaway we bought things at 20 percent
01:46:21.900 of of then liquidating value and in the
01:46:25.440 old days the Ben Graham followers could
01:46:27.719 run their Geiger counters over
01:46:30.360 Corporate America and they could
01:46:32.699 spill out a few things and you could
01:46:35.159 easily see if you were at all familiar
01:46:37.260 with the market prices of of whole
01:46:39.600 corporations
01:46:40.860 that you were buying at a huge discount
01:46:43.619 well no matter how bad the management if
01:46:46.440 you're buying it 50 of asset value or 30
01:46:49.500 percent or so on down you have a lot
01:46:52.199 going for you
01:46:53.460 and uh and
01:46:56.340 as the world is wised up and as docs
01:46:59.699 have behaved so well for people that
01:47:01.739 stocks generally have gone
01:47:04.080 to higher and higher prices that game
01:47:06.659 gets much harder now to find something
01:47:08.820 at a discount from intrinsic value
01:47:12.480 those simple systems
01:47:14.520 ordinarily don't work
01:47:16.679 you've got to get into Warren's kind of
01:47:20.100 thinking and that is a lot
01:47:23.820 harder
01:47:26.040 I think you can predict the future in a
01:47:28.199 few places
01:47:29.400 best if you understand a few basic ideas
01:47:32.400 that come from a good general education
01:47:35.219 and that's what I was talking about in
01:47:38.100 that talk I gave at the USC Business
01:47:39.780 School
01:47:43.380 in other words Coca-Cola is a simple
01:47:45.480 company if it's stripped down and
01:47:48.119 analyzed in terms of some Elemental
01:47:50.760 forces
01:47:53.340 majority it's hard to understand Costco
01:47:55.020 either you know I mean there are certain
01:47:57.420 fundamental models out there that do not
01:47:59.639 take
01:48:00.780 you don't have the kind of ability that
01:48:02.520 quantum mechanics requires you just have
01:48:05.100 to know a few simple things and really
01:48:06.900 know them
01:48:08.880 Charlie talks about liquid email you're
01:48:10.619 not talking about closing up the
01:48:11.699 Enterprise but he's talking about what
01:48:13.860 somebody else would pay for that stream
01:48:15.239 of cash too I mean if you could have
01:48:18.540 looked at a collection of television
01:48:20.219 stations uh owned by a cap cities for
01:48:23.400 example in them
01:48:24.719 in the early well 1974 and it would have
01:48:27.719 been worth we'll say four times what the
01:48:29.460 company was selling for uh not because
01:48:32.340 you'd close the stations but just their
01:48:34.260 stream of income was worth that to
01:48:35.820 somebody else it's just that the
01:48:37.080 marketplace
01:48:38.460 was uh very depressed depressed although
01:48:42.179 like I say on a negotiated basis you
01:48:44.340 could have gone and sold the properties
01:48:45.420 for four times what the the company was
01:48:47.100 selling for and you got wonderful
01:48:48.060 management and I mean those things
01:48:50.040 happen in markets they will happen again
01:48:52.440 at uh uh but part of
01:48:55.679 part of investing and calculating
01:48:57.239 intrinsic values is if you get the wrong
01:48:58.860 answer when you get through in other
01:49:00.300 words if it says don't buy you can't buy
01:49:02.340 just because somebody else thinks it's
01:49:03.659 going to go up or because your friends
01:49:04.860 have made a lot of easy money lately or
01:49:06.360 anything of the sort you just you have
01:49:08.460 to be able to uh to walk away from
01:49:10.860 anything that doesn't work and and very
01:49:13.020 few things work these days you also have
01:49:14.699 to work walk away from anything you
01:49:16.020 don't understand which in my case is a
01:49:18.000 big handicap
01:49:19.380 but you'd agree with Joanne that it's
01:49:21.239 much harder now yeah but I would also
01:49:23.820 agree that almost at any time over the
01:49:25.800 last 40 years that we've been up on a
01:49:27.179 Podium we would have said it was much
01:49:28.260 harder in the past
01:49:29.900 but it is harder now it's way harder it
01:49:32.880 the part of part of it being harder now
01:49:34.619 too is is the amount of capital we run I
01:49:36.840 mean if
01:49:38.639 if we were running a hundred thousand
01:49:40.440 dollars
01:49:41.520 our prospects for returns would be and
01:49:44.219 and we really needed the money our
01:49:46.320 prospects for return would be
01:49:48.420 considerably better than they are
01:49:50.280 uh running Berkshire it's just it's very
01:49:52.380 simple our universe of possible ideas
01:49:54.239 would expand by it a huge Factor we are
01:49:58.020 looking at things today
01:50:00.119 that by their nature a lot of people
01:50:02.159 have to are looking at and and there
01:50:04.619 were times in the past when we were
01:50:06.300 looking at things that very few people
01:50:07.619 were looking at but there were other
01:50:09.239 times in the past when we were looking
01:50:10.560 at things where the whole world was just
01:50:11.820 looking at them kind of crazy
01:50:13.440 and
01:50:14.580 and that that's a decided help
01:50:19.260 Michael zanga from Danvers Massachusetts
01:50:21.440 that's a town who's missed who's banned
01:50:24.179 Mr Buffett so generously sent to the
01:50:25.920 Rose Bowl Parade last year so you're a
01:50:27.840 very popular guy in my town
01:50:29.820 good morning Mr Buffett Mr Munger Mr
01:50:32.460 Buffett I want to ask you this question
01:50:33.900 last week when I ran into after
01:50:35.340 gillette's annual meeting but I choked
01:50:37.500 so now there's no pressure here goes
01:50:40.739 in the years from my reading in the
01:50:43.080 years from 1956 through 69 you achieved
01:50:46.260 the best results of your career
01:50:47.520 quantitatively 29 annually against only
01:50:51.060 seven percent for the Dow
01:50:53.040 your approach then was different than
01:50:54.780 now you look for lots of undervalued
01:50:57.179 stocks with less attention to
01:50:59.159 competitive advantage or favorable
01:51:00.719 economics and sold them rather quickly
01:51:04.080 as a capital base grew you switch your
01:51:06.840 approach to buying undervalued excellent
01:51:09.179 companies with favorable long-term
01:51:11.100 economics
01:51:12.420 my question is if you're investing a
01:51:14.760 small sum today which approach would you
01:51:17.040 use
01:51:18.840 well I would use
01:51:20.880 the approach that
01:51:22.739 I think I'm using now of trying to
01:51:25.560 search out businesses that were I think
01:51:28.560 they're selling at the
01:51:30.239 lowest price relative to the discounted
01:51:32.520 cash they would produce in the future
01:51:34.560 but if I were working with a small
01:51:36.780 amount of money the universe would be
01:51:38.520 huge compared to the universe of
01:51:40.560 possible ideas I work with now you
01:51:42.719 mentioned that 50
01:51:44.580 6 to 69 was the best period actually my
01:51:47.580 best period was before that was from
01:51:49.920 right after I met Ben Graham in 19 early
01:51:52.820 1951 but from the end of 1950
01:51:57.000 through the next 10 years actually
01:51:59.940 returns averaged about 50 percent a year
01:52:02.400 and I think they were 37 points better
01:52:04.500 than the Dow Peri or something like that
01:52:06.119 but that I was working with a tiny tiny
01:52:08.699 tiny amount of money
01:52:10.080 and so I would pour through volumes of
01:52:13.940 businesses and I would find one or two
01:52:16.199 that I could put ten thousand dollars
01:52:18.179 into or fifteen thousand dollars into
01:52:19.800 that which is ridiculous they were
01:52:22.020 ridiculously cheap and obviously as the
01:52:24.780 money increased uh then the universe of
01:52:28.739 possible ideas started shrinking
01:52:30.659 dramatically the times were also better
01:52:32.699 for doing it in that time but I I think
01:52:34.500 that
01:52:35.639 I think if you're working with a small
01:52:37.380 amount of money
01:52:38.580 with exactly the same background that
01:52:41.100 Charlie and I have and same ideas same
01:52:43.619 same whatever ability we have you know I
01:52:47.159 think you can make very significant sums
01:52:49.320 but you but as soon as you start getting
01:52:51.360 the money up into the Millions many
01:52:54.239 millions the the the curve on expectable
01:52:57.840 results falls off just dramatically uh
01:53:01.199 but that's that's the nature of it
01:53:03.000 you've gotta you know one you've you
01:53:06.239 when you get up to things you could put
01:53:07.920 millions of dollars into
01:53:09.719 you've got a lot of competition looking
01:53:11.699 at that and they're not looking as I did
01:53:14.040 when I started when I started I went
01:53:15.600 through the pages of the manuals Page by
01:53:17.400 page I mean I probably went through 20
01:53:19.320 000 Pages uh in the Moody's industrial
01:53:22.139 Transportation Banks and finance manuals
01:53:24.420 and I did it twice
01:53:26.219 and I actually you know looked at every
01:53:27.900 business I didn't look very hard at some
01:53:29.400 well that's not a practical way to
01:53:32.340 invest tens or hundreds of millions of
01:53:34.440 dollars so I would say if you're working
01:53:36.179 with a small sum of money
01:53:38.040 that and you're really interested in in
01:53:40.739 the business and willing to do the work
01:53:43.320 you can you will find something if you
01:53:45.900 were there's no question about in my
01:53:47.520 mind you will find some things that
01:53:49.440 promise
01:53:51.300 very large
01:53:53.280 returns compared to what we will be able
01:53:56.219 to uh deliver with large sums of money
01:53:59.820 Charlie
01:54:03.480 well yeah I think that's right a
01:54:05.159 brilliant man who can't get any money
01:54:06.960 from other people
01:54:08.699 is working with a very small something
01:54:11.639 probably should work in very obscure
01:54:13.980 stocks
01:54:16.199 searching out
01:54:18.000 uh unusual mispriced opportunities
01:54:22.560 but
01:54:24.360 you know you could
01:54:27.600 that's such a small world
01:54:30.780 it may be a way for one person to come
01:54:32.580 up but it's a it's a long slog
01:54:37.440 yeah most smart people unfortunately in
01:54:39.420 Wall Street figured that they can make a
01:54:40.800 lot more money a lot easier
01:54:43.320 just by uh one way or another and um uh
01:54:48.540 getting an override on other people's
01:54:50.340 money or or or
01:54:53.060 uh delivering services in some way that
01:54:56.040 people and the monetization of Hope and
01:54:59.219 greed you know as a way to make a huge
01:55:01.679 amount of money and right now it's very
01:55:03.900 just take hedge funds I mean it's I
01:55:06.900 I've had calls from a couple of friends
01:55:09.840 in the last month that don't know
01:55:11.760 anything about that investing money
01:55:14.159 they've been unsuccessful and everything
01:55:15.360 else and you know one of them called me
01:55:16.920 the name said well I'm forming a small
01:55:18.239 hedge fund 125 5 million he was talking
01:55:20.400 about like the thought that since it was
01:55:22.560 only 125 million maybe we ought to put
01:55:24.119 in 10 million or something I mean if you
01:55:27.119 looked at this fellow Schedule D on his
01:55:29.100 1040 for the last 20 years you know
01:55:31.860 you'd think you ought to be mowing lawns
01:55:33.360 but yeah but he may get his 125 million
01:55:37.440 I mean you know it's it's just
01:55:39.360 astounding to me
01:55:41.420 how willing people are during a bull
01:55:44.400 market just uh just to toss money around
01:55:47.340 because they you know they think it's
01:55:48.420 easy and and of course that's that's
01:55:51.300 what they felt about internet stocks a
01:55:53.340 few years ago they're thinking about
01:55:54.239 something else next year too but uh
01:55:58.320 the
01:56:00.659 the biggest money
01:56:03.719 made you know in Wall Street in recent
01:56:06.540 years
01:56:07.619 has not been made by great performance
01:56:09.420 but it's been by been made by great
01:56:11.340 promotion basically
01:56:13.739 Charlie do you have anything
01:56:16.560 well I would
01:56:18.719 have stated even more strongly
01:56:21.840 I think the current scene is obscene
01:56:27.420 I think there's
01:56:29.280 too much Mania there's too much chasing
01:56:31.560 after easy money
01:56:33.600 there's too much
01:56:36.360 misleading sales material about
01:56:38.159 Investments
01:56:41.219 there's too much on the
01:56:43.679 television
01:56:45.440 emphasizing speculation in stocks
01:56:51.020 Matthew Monahan from Palo Alto
01:56:53.880 California
01:56:54.780 Mr Buffett Mr Munger first of all I want
01:56:57.540 to thank both of you so for so freely
01:56:59.940 sharing your wisdom and knowledge over
01:57:01.619 the years even though we've never met in
01:57:03.600 person I consider Ebola to be close
01:57:05.340 personal mentors and attribute your
01:57:07.560 teachings and philosophies to any
01:57:09.179 success I've had in business so far so
01:57:11.580 thank you here's my question
01:57:14.099 for a 23 year old with high Ambitions
01:57:16.800 some initial working capital and a
01:57:19.380 genetic wiring as you call it for
01:57:21.599 disciplines like Investments Mathematics
01:57:24.060 and Technology what do you foresee is
01:57:26.880 the significant areas of opportunity
01:57:29.159 over the next 50 even 100 years and if
01:57:33.360 you were in my shoes what would be your
01:57:35.820 approach and methodology for really
01:57:38.639 learning tackling and mastering these
01:57:41.880 areas of opportunity for the purpose of
01:57:44.460 massive value creation
01:57:46.860 well I I
01:57:48.420 remain very
01:57:51.179 and and frankly when you get the chance
01:57:53.699 to talk to somebody like Lorimer
01:57:56.099 Davidson as I did was when I was 20
01:57:58.020 years old I probably learned
01:58:00.060 more from Laura Marr Davidson in those
01:58:02.159 four or five hours than I learned in in
01:58:05.400 college with the you know exception of
01:58:07.380 learning some accounting or one or two
01:58:09.000 subjects like that so you just want to
01:58:11.699 soak it up if you have those qualities
01:58:13.380 you talked about
01:58:15.420 you'll see the areas as you go along I
01:58:19.139 mean we have
01:58:20.340 Charlie and I
01:58:21.960 probably you know we've made money in a
01:58:24.900 lot of different ways some of which we
01:58:27.239 didn't anticipate you know when we were
01:58:29.400 30 or 40 years ago
01:58:31.639 but we did have the ability
01:58:35.040 to recognize some we didn't have the
01:58:37.080 ability to recognize others but we did
01:58:39.960 know when we knew what we were doing and
01:58:41.520 when we didn't and we just kept looking
01:58:43.260 we had a curiosity about things you
01:58:46.139 would know at a time like the long-term
01:58:48.119 Capital Management crisis for example
01:58:50.340 that there were going to be ways to make
01:58:52.139 money I mean it just was they were going
01:58:54.300 to be out there and all you had to do
01:58:55.500 was just read and think uh eight or ten
01:58:58.739 hours a day and you were going to cover
01:59:00.480 a lot of possibilities probably a very
01:59:03.300 high percentage of them good and it's
01:59:05.159 and some of them sensational
01:59:07.139 so you can't really lay it out ahead of
01:59:09.179 time you can't you can't have a
01:59:10.920 you can't have a defined road map but
01:59:14.219 you can have a reservoir
01:59:16.440 of thinking looking at different kinds
01:59:19.679 of businesses looking at different kinds
01:59:21.300 of Securities looking at markets in
01:59:23.040 different places and you will then spot
01:59:25.920 a reasonable number of things that come
01:59:27.480 along you won't spot every one of them
01:59:28.860 we've missed all kinds of things but the
01:59:31.920 biggest thing too is to have something
01:59:34.380 in the way you're programmed
01:59:36.840 so that you don't ever do anything where
01:59:38.699 you can lose a lot I mean
01:59:41.659 our best ideas have not been better than
01:59:44.460 other people's best ideas but we've
01:59:46.860 never had a lot of things that pulled us
01:59:48.900 way back so we we never went two steps
01:59:51.780 forward and one step back we probably
01:59:53.460 went two steps forward in a fraction of
01:59:55.320 a step back but but it uh
01:59:58.320 avoiding the catastrophes
02:00:00.780 is a very important thing and it will be
02:00:03.060 important in the future I mean you will
02:00:04.560 have your chance to participate in
02:00:06.119 catastrophes Charlie
02:00:08.400 yeah and of course the place to look
02:00:10.500 when you're young is in the inefficient
02:00:12.360 markets
02:00:15.000 you shouldn't be trying to guess whether
02:00:17.940 you know one drug company has a better
02:00:19.920 drug pipeline than another
02:00:22.080 you want to go
02:00:23.940 when you're young someplace that's very
02:00:25.679 inefficient
02:00:28.199 me trying to guess whether the stock
02:00:29.400 market is going to go up or whether
02:00:30.920 long-term bonds are going to change in
02:00:33.360 yield I mean you don't have anything to
02:00:35.340 going in that kind of a game but you can
02:00:37.739 have a lot going in in in in games that
02:00:40.020 very few people are
02:00:41.520 are playing and maybe where they're even
02:00:43.320 got their heads screwed on wrong in
02:00:44.880 terms of how they're thinking about the
02:00:46.080 subject the RTC was a great example of a
02:00:49.500 chance to to make a lot of money I mean
02:00:53.880 here was a seller of ten hundreds of
02:00:57.060 billions of dollars worth of real estate
02:00:58.560 where the people that were selling it
02:01:00.300 had no economic interest in it were
02:01:01.980 eager to wind up the thing you know and
02:01:04.320 they were selling at a terrible time
02:01:05.639 when the people who had been Ventures
02:01:06.960 cement and lending were no longer
02:01:08.400 lending the people who have been
02:01:09.540 venturesome in in the equity end of real
02:01:12.179 estate had gotten cleaned out so you had
02:01:14.940 a great background of environment and
02:01:16.800 then you had you had an imbalance of
02:01:19.260 intensity in terms of analyzing
02:01:21.719 situations between the seller which was
02:01:24.360 the government with a bunch of people
02:01:26.219 who had no economic interest in it were
02:01:28.260 probably eager to wind up the job and
02:01:30.780 buyers on the other side who were of the
02:01:34.860 generally cautious type because the more
02:01:36.420 Ventures some time it had taken
02:01:37.920 themselves out of action so and there
02:01:39.659 were huge amounts of property so you get
02:01:41.940 these opportunities and you'll get more
02:01:43.619 I mean it there won't be any scarcity of
02:01:46.619 opportunities in in your life although
02:01:48.719 it would be days when you feel that way
02:01:51.840 yes uh hi Mr Buffett Mr Monger this is
02:01:54.060 uh Whitney Tilson a shareholder from New
02:01:55.739 York for many years both of you have
02:01:57.599 been warning about the dangers of
02:01:58.800 derivatives at one point calling them
02:02:00.840 Financial weapons of mass destruction uh
02:02:03.719 yet every year tens of trillions of
02:02:05.580 dollars of derivatives are bought and
02:02:08.040 sold it just seems to be getting bigger
02:02:10.020 and bigger and almost certainly
02:02:11.699 improperly accounted for and so I was
02:02:14.099 wondering if you could comment uh if
02:02:15.900 specifically if you have any thoughts on
02:02:18.060 how much longer this might go on do you
02:02:20.099 see anything imminent that could derail
02:02:22.619 this ever inflating bubble what might
02:02:25.020 trigger it and who should be doing what
02:02:27.960 to try and mitigate this looming Danger
02:02:32.580 well we've tried to do a little to
02:02:33.960 mitigate it ourselves by talking about
02:02:35.400 it but the
02:02:37.920 you're right that
02:02:40.679 and it isn't the derivative of itself
02:02:42.840 and there's nothing evil about a
02:02:44.159 derivative instrument as I mentioned we
02:02:45.420 we have 60 some of them at at Berkshire
02:02:48.119 and on Monday I will go over the
02:02:49.619 directors with the directors I'll go
02:02:51.900 over all 60 some and
02:02:53.760 believe me we'll make money
02:02:55.619 out of those particular instruments uh
02:02:58.320 but
02:03:00.440 the usage of them
02:03:04.380 on an expanding basis more and more
02:03:06.900 imaginative ways of using them
02:03:08.480 introduces essentially more and more
02:03:10.739 leverage
02:03:12.000 into the system
02:03:14.099 and it's an invisible or largely
02:03:16.800 invisible sort of Leverage
02:03:18.599 if you go back to the 1920s
02:03:21.540 uh
02:03:22.920 after the crash
02:03:25.020 the United States government held
02:03:26.699 hearings
02:03:27.840 they decided that
02:03:29.760 leverage margin in those days that they
02:03:32.400 call leverage contributed
02:03:34.860 to perhaps the
02:03:37.560 crash itself and certainly to the extent
02:03:40.500 of the crash and it was like pouring
02:03:43.320 gasoline on a fire was When
02:03:47.780 people's Holdings got tripped you know
02:03:50.400 when stocks went down 10 percent people
02:03:51.960 had to sell another 10 more people had
02:03:53.940 to sell and so on
02:03:55.400 leverage was regarded as dangerous in
02:03:57.960 the federal and the United States
02:03:59.159 government empowered the Federal Reserve
02:04:01.739 to
02:04:03.060 regulate margin requirements regulate
02:04:05.340 leverage and that was taken very
02:04:07.199 seriously
02:04:08.520 and for decades it was a a source
02:04:13.679 of real attention if you went to a bank
02:04:15.900 and tried to borrow money on a stock
02:04:17.280 they may just sign certain papers as to
02:04:19.679 you weren't in violation of the margin
02:04:21.719 requirements and they policed it
02:04:23.880 and it was taken quite seriously when
02:04:26.159 the FED increased or decreased margin
02:04:28.199 requirements it was a signal of Love
02:04:30.000 they felt about
02:04:31.260 the level of speculation well the
02:04:33.480 introduction of
02:04:35.159 of
02:04:36.719 derivatives
02:04:38.219 and index future all that sort of thing
02:04:40.679 uh it's just totally made any regulation
02:04:44.340 of margin requirements a joke they still
02:04:47.940 exist and the you know it's it's a it's
02:04:50.940 an anachronism
02:04:52.880 so
02:04:54.599 I believe I think Charlie probably
02:04:56.219 agrees with me
02:04:57.540 that we may not know
02:05:02.760 where exactly the danger begins and
02:05:05.280 where and at what point it becomes a
02:05:07.860 super danger and so on we certainly
02:05:09.540 don't know what will end it precisely we
02:05:11.639 don't know when it will end precisely
02:05:13.219 but we
02:05:15.000 probably at least I believe that it will
02:05:18.000 go on and increase to the point
02:05:20.460 where at some point
02:05:22.380 uh there'll be some very unpleasant
02:05:25.139 things happen in markets because of it
02:05:26.940 you saw one example
02:05:29.400 uh
02:05:31.080 of what can happen
02:05:33.119 under four sales
02:05:35.400 uh back in October 19 1987 when you had
02:05:39.960 so-called portfolio Insurance well now
02:05:41.820 portfolio insurance and you ought to go
02:05:43.800 back and read the literature for the
02:05:45.780 couple years preceding that I mean this
02:05:47.580 was something that came out of Academia
02:05:49.320 and it was regarded as a great advance
02:05:51.540 in financial theories and everything it
02:05:53.820 was a joke it was a bunch of stop-loss
02:05:56.099 orders which you know go back 150 years
02:05:58.139 or something except that they were done
02:06:00.360 automatically and in large scale by
02:06:03.179 institutions and they were merchandise
02:06:04.800 people paid a lot of money to people to
02:06:07.020 teach them how to put in a stop-loss
02:06:08.639 order and what happened of course was
02:06:11.460 that if you have a whole series of
02:06:13.800 stop-loss orders by very big
02:06:15.480 institutions you are pouring gasoline on
02:06:19.139 on fire and when October 19th came along
02:06:22.020 you had a 22 shrink in the value of
02:06:25.139 American Business caused essentially by
02:06:27.840 a Doomsday Machine a dead hand was
02:06:30.000 selling as each level got hit
02:06:32.820 and three weeks earlier you know people
02:06:35.460 were proclaiming the the beauty of this
02:06:37.199 well that is nothing
02:06:39.560 compared it was a formal arrangement to
02:06:43.560 have these this Dynamic hedging or
02:06:45.719 portfolio Insurance uh sell things but
02:06:48.599 you have the same thing existing when
02:06:51.239 you have
02:06:52.320 fund operators operating with billions
02:06:54.540 in in aggregate trillions of dollars
02:06:57.500 leveraged who will respond to the same
02:07:00.300 stimulus
02:07:02.280 they have what is they have what we
02:07:04.500 would call a crowded trade but they
02:07:06.119 don't know it it's not a formal crowded
02:07:07.739 trade it's just that they're all ready
02:07:10.380 to sell if a certain
02:07:12.780 given signal or certain given activity
02:07:15.679 occurs and when you get that coupled
02:07:18.659 with extreme leverage which derivatives
02:07:20.940 allow you will someday get a very very
02:07:24.060 chaotic situation I have no idea when I
02:07:26.340 have no idea what the exogenous factor I
02:07:28.800 didn't know that shooting some Archduke
02:07:30.300 you know would start World War one and I
02:07:32.040 have no idea what will cause this kind
02:07:34.440 of a thing but it'll happen
02:07:37.500 trying yeah and of course the the
02:07:40.199 accounting
02:07:42.719 being deficient enormously contributes
02:07:45.540 to the risks
02:07:46.860 if you get paid enormous bonuses based
02:07:51.360 on reporting profits that don't exist
02:07:53.300 you're going to keep doing whatever
02:07:56.340 causes those phony profits to keep
02:07:59.219 appearing on the books
02:08:00.900 and
02:08:02.340 and what makes that so difficult is that
02:08:04.920 most of the accounting profession
02:08:06.060 doesn't even recognize how stupidly it
02:08:09.119 is behaving and
02:08:13.980 one of the people in charge of
02:08:15.480 accounting standards said to me
02:08:18.780 well this is better this derivative
02:08:21.360 accounting because it's Mark to Market
02:08:23.820 and don't we want current information
02:08:27.960 and I said yes but if you
02:08:30.119 marked a model
02:08:31.920 and and you create the models and your
02:08:35.760 accountants
02:08:37.260 trust your models
02:08:39.659 and you can just report whatever profit
02:08:41.400 you want as long as you keep expanding
02:08:43.500 the positions bigger and bigger and
02:08:45.000 bigger the way human nature is that will
02:08:47.760 cause terrible results and terrible
02:08:49.920 Behavior
02:08:51.000 and this person said to me well you just
02:08:52.980 don't understand accounting
02:08:58.980 if four years ago or whenever it was
02:09:01.080 when we started to liquidate Henry's
02:09:04.080 portfolio we we had it we had reserves
02:09:06.780 set up for in the hundreds of Millions
02:09:08.280 with and all sorts of sorts of things
02:09:10.080 and our auditor and I emphasize any
02:09:12.900 other of the big four Auditors
02:09:14.760 absolutely would have attested to the
02:09:16.920 fact that our stop was marked to Market
02:09:18.960 you know I just wish I'd sold the
02:09:20.460 portfolio to the Auditors that day maybe
02:09:22.800 400 million better off
02:09:25.260 so it it's a real problem now there's
02:09:27.719 one thing that's that's really quite
02:09:29.280 interesting to me you know if if I owe
02:09:32.219 you on my dry cleaning bill or something
02:09:34.699 15 and they're auditing the dry cleaners
02:09:38.340 they check with me and they find out
02:09:40.139 that I owe you fifteen dollars and it's
02:09:42.540 all fine if they're auditing me they
02:09:44.099 find out that I owe the dry cleaner 15
02:09:45.780 bucks
02:09:47.219 there are only four big auditing firms
02:09:49.920 you know basically in this country
02:09:52.440 and I will and so in many cases if
02:09:55.980 they're auditing my side of the
02:09:57.780 derivative transaction you know what I'm
02:10:00.599 valuing it at the the same firm May
02:10:03.960 often be value at valuing or attesting
02:10:06.900 to the value of the of the mark by the
02:10:10.500 person on the other side of the contract
02:10:12.540 I will guarantee you that if you add up
02:10:15.599 the marks
02:10:17.400 on both sides
02:10:19.260 they don't they don't equate out to zero
02:10:22.040 we we have 60 some contracts you know
02:10:26.099 and I will bet that people are valuing
02:10:28.619 them differently on the other side than
02:10:30.420 we value them themselves and it won't be
02:10:32.400 to the disadvantage of the trader on the
02:10:34.500 other side I don't get paid based on how
02:10:37.080 ours are valued so I've got no reason to
02:10:39.480 want to game the system but there are
02:10:42.659 people out on the other side that do
02:10:44.400 have reasons to gain the system so if
02:10:46.860 I'm valuing some contract
02:10:48.900 at plus a million dollars for Berkshire
02:10:52.199 that contract on the other side is just
02:10:54.239 one piece of paper should be valued at a
02:10:56.520 minus one million by somebody else but I
02:10:59.099 think you probably have cases and this
02:11:00.900 is I'm going to talk about our Auditors
02:11:02.040 I'm talking about all four of the firms
02:11:04.739 but they have many cases where they are
02:11:07.619 attesting the values that of the exact
02:11:09.840 same piece of paper where the numbers
02:11:11.940 are widely different on both sides
02:11:14.340 you have any thoughts on that Charlie
02:11:18.480 sure as God made little green apples
02:11:20.639 this is going to cause a lot of trouble
02:11:22.739 in due course
02:11:24.480 as long as it keeps expanding and
02:11:26.400 ballooning and so on and the convulsions
02:11:28.440 are minor it can just go on and on but
02:11:31.260 eventually
02:11:32.460 there will be
02:11:34.139 a big a big denomo
02:11:39.420 my name is Ethan Berg I'm from Cambridge
02:11:41.639 Massachusetts and I'd like to thank you
02:11:43.800 for the education you've provided
02:11:45.480 particularly with the annual reports
02:11:47.460 I've got three brief questions years ago
02:11:50.520 you wrote to your friend Jory orange the
02:11:53.340 you applying to Columbia's business
02:11:54.659 school because they had a pretty good
02:11:56.219 finance department and a couple of hot
02:11:58.320 shots in Graham and Dodd if you're
02:12:00.659 considering graduate or business school
02:12:02.219 today with which individuals or
02:12:05.420 professors would you want to study
02:12:08.219 second question is a friend who wants to
02:12:10.500 know your thoughts on the concrete
02:12:12.119 cement and Aggregates business and the
02:12:14.880 third question is from my wife
02:12:16.800 you mentioned earlier if someone were
02:12:18.599 buying a parachute they wouldn't buy
02:12:20.760 based on lowest bid we saw you touring
02:12:23.460 around in a car this week that were to
02:12:25.560 be bought today could probably be bought
02:12:27.780 at a relatively low bid
02:12:30.300 as someone interested in your health
02:12:32.159 she's wondering whether you've
02:12:33.960 considered a newer automobile possibly
02:12:36.300 one with lots of airbags
02:12:39.900 actually I picked out the car I have
02:12:41.520 based on the fact that had airbags on
02:12:43.080 both sides so that that was a that was a
02:12:45.780 factor and maybe the first garbage type
02:12:48.900 ever made with airbags but I think I
02:12:51.599 think I I I think my car actually it's
02:12:54.239 both heavy and has airbags and and that
02:12:56.400 those are two primary factors in safety
02:12:58.500 I don't think any any any uh
02:13:00.659 I don't think it's safer car is
02:13:02.040 necessarily being made it might be safer
02:13:04.260 to drive around in a big heavy duty
02:13:05.820 truck or something but I'm not ready for
02:13:07.380 that uh the uh incidentally on a car I
02:13:11.460 look at that like anything else
02:13:15.000 it would take me probably a half a day
02:13:18.000 to go through the you know the exercise
02:13:20.099 of buying a car and reading the owner's
02:13:22.260 manual and all that and that's just a
02:13:23.579 half a day I don't want to give up in my
02:13:24.900 life for for no benefit uh you know if
02:13:27.300 if I could if I could write a check
02:13:29.940 in 30 seconds and be in the same
02:13:31.800 position I'm in now with a newer car I'd
02:13:34.199 be glad to do it this afternoon but I I
02:13:36.300 don't like to I don't like to trade away
02:13:37.679 when there's really no benefit to me at
02:13:39.960 all I'm totally happy with the car
02:13:42.060 I'm I just don't want to trade away the
02:13:44.579 the amount of time I'd have to spend
02:13:45.900 fooling around
02:13:47.420 to get familiar with the and get title
02:13:50.579 to and do all the things rest of the
02:13:52.199 things pick one out saw a new car but if
02:13:54.900 there's a safer car made
02:13:56.520 you know I'll be I'll be driving in it
02:13:58.920 um the the uh the Aggregates business
02:14:02.040 concrete all of that those are
02:14:04.260 businesses and Charlie probably knows
02:14:06.060 more about them than I do we've looked
02:14:07.380 at businesses like that in fact we've
02:14:08.699 even owned a few shares at one time or
02:14:10.380 another because
02:14:11.639 it's an understandable business and in
02:14:14.579 it's a business that
02:14:16.440 well particularly if you get into
02:14:17.639 concrete cement I mean you know there
02:14:20.159 have been periods of substantial over
02:14:21.780 capacity particularly on a regional
02:14:23.340 basis but but those are fundamental
02:14:25.440 businesses and and
02:14:27.119 at a price you know for
02:14:29.340 low cost capacity and uh advantageously
02:14:33.119 located raw materials and so on
02:14:36.420 um you know we would do in fact Charlie
02:14:37.679 and I look talked about one probably 10
02:14:40.079 or 15 years ago quite a bit uh and he's
02:14:43.440 had fair amount of familiarity with it
02:14:45.239 uh
02:14:46.199 and what was the other one I jotted it
02:14:48.000 down here let's see
02:14:51.000 he wanted to know what business school
02:14:52.800 all Business Schools yeah well I would I
02:14:55.079 would say this that
02:14:56.699 that uh I think Bruce Bruce greenwald's
02:15:00.360 class at Columbia
02:15:02.280 is very good he gets in a lot of people
02:15:04.619 that uh
02:15:05.760 that uh our practitioners so there's a
02:15:09.000 lot of practicality to the course and I
02:15:10.860 think Bruce is good he's got a new book
02:15:12.060 coming out that that uh probably within
02:15:15.000 the next six months or so that that
02:15:16.679 we'll deal with that and then
02:15:19.079 they're also been a
02:15:21.360 uh
02:15:24.420 endowed at the University of Florida
02:15:26.840 certain courses relating to Value
02:15:29.760 investing and I think there's been one
02:15:31.079 at the University of Missouri so I would
02:15:32.760 suggest you at least check out the
02:15:34.199 curriculum
02:15:35.340 at the University of Missouri in
02:15:36.900 Columbia and and Florida and uh and do a
02:15:40.560 little comparison and maybe check with a
02:15:42.119 few graduates
02:15:43.260 recent graduates as to what kind of
02:15:45.239 experience they had that I think you can
02:15:47.520 if you can find them I think that's the
02:15:49.260 best the best system for evaluating a
02:15:51.540 place but those three at least have
02:15:52.860 courses that
02:15:54.119 based on the
02:15:56.280 on the catalog sound sound like uh uh
02:15:59.760 they might be of interest to you Charlie
02:16:01.500 yeah
02:16:03.960 a huge majority of the business school
02:16:06.239 teaching
02:16:07.380 on the field of
02:16:09.360 investment
02:16:11.099 of
02:16:12.360 passive portfolios of securities
02:16:15.659 is not what we believe and not
02:16:19.260 what Warren was taught Years Ago by Ben
02:16:21.360 Graham
02:16:22.560 and they're just little pockets of
02:16:25.619 of our attitude left there's one at
02:16:29.400 Stanford
02:16:30.420 Jack McDonald yeah sure and uh yeah
02:16:34.019 that's graduate school he's a graduate
02:16:35.760 school and what's interesting about that
02:16:38.580 is I think it's the most popular course
02:16:40.500 in the whole Stanford Business School
02:16:42.780 they've got some kind of a bidding
02:16:44.340 system
02:16:45.420 and
02:16:47.280 yet I asked Jack how he felt and he's
02:16:51.780 he said he felt lonely
02:16:54.080 he's got the most popular course but in
02:16:57.599 the whole professoriat dealing with
02:17:00.240 investment matters the Jack McDonald's
02:17:02.398 are a little
02:17:04.620 clan of their own and a
02:17:07.200 in a side pocket so to speak now they're
02:17:10.500 right
02:17:11.280 and they can take whatever consolation
02:17:13.439 they get from that but
02:17:15.540 but mostly if you go to a business
02:17:17.218 school you will learn a lot of things we
02:17:19.439 don't believe
02:17:20.459 yeah Jack um
02:17:22.439 Bob Kirby comes in and works with Jack
02:17:24.420 sometimes too and you couldn't and Bob
02:17:26.099 has got a terrific mind in terms of
02:17:28.799 investment so that I mean there's no
02:17:29.939 question about that if it you know it's
02:17:31.679 not the easiest School in the world to
02:17:32.939 get into and and it is at The Graduate
02:17:35.340 level but there are these
02:17:38.000 occasional uh
02:17:41.218 little anomalies as they would say uh in
02:17:44.459 in the teaching world I mean what you
02:17:46.200 really want
02:17:47.939 a course on investing to be is how to
02:17:50.519 value a business that's that's what the
02:17:52.379 game is about I mean if you don't know
02:17:54.240 how to value a business you don't know
02:17:55.439 how to value a stock
02:17:57.058 and if you look at what is being taught
02:18:00.478 uh I think you see very little of how to
02:18:02.939 value a business and and the rest of it
02:18:04.978 is playing around maybe with numbers or
02:18:06.898 you know uh Greek symbols or something
02:18:09.718 of the sort but but it doesn't do you
02:18:12.599 any good I mean then you have to decide
02:18:13.978 you know whether you're going whether
02:18:15.179 you're going to value a business at 400
02:18:17.820 million dollars or 600 million dollars
02:18:19.558 or 800 million dollars and then you
02:18:21.540 compare that with the price
02:18:23.580 and that's that's what investing is and
02:18:26.099 I don't know any other kind of investing
02:18:27.718 you know basically to do and there's
02:18:29.700 that just isn't taught and the reason it
02:18:31.920 isn't taught is because there aren't
02:18:33.898 teachers around you know who know how to
02:18:36.120 teach it I mean they don't know
02:18:37.439 themselves
02:18:38.580 and since they don't know themselves
02:18:40.260 they teach something that says nobody
02:18:41.879 knows anything and which is the
02:18:43.859 efficient market theory and if I didn't
02:18:47.398 know how to do it if I ever teach
02:18:48.840 physics I'm going to come up with a
02:18:50.040 theory that nobody knows anything
02:18:51.179 because it's the the only only way I can
02:18:53.519 get through the day you know but uh
02:18:57.000 it's fascinating to me I'll I'll
02:19:01.200 uh how the you know the really great
02:19:02.760 universities operate in this respect
02:19:04.500 they uh uh if you get a sacred writ I
02:19:08.760 mean you get in the finance department
02:19:09.959 because you sign on
02:19:12.120 you know to whatever the present group
02:19:13.740 thinks and if they think the world is
02:19:15.240 flat you better think the world is flat
02:19:16.859 too you know and your students better
02:19:18.780 answer the world's flat when they got a
02:19:20.939 on exams
02:19:22.620 listen I I would say investment
02:19:25.558 Finance teaching in this country is is
02:19:28.558 uh
02:19:30.120 in general is kind of pathetic
02:19:33.420 well I think the Business Schools do a
02:19:36.058 pretty good job when it comes to
02:19:37.500 accounting or or personnel management or
02:19:41.599 or a whole lot of subjects I think they
02:19:44.580 do quite well with but they miss one
02:19:47.820 enormous opportunity
02:19:49.800 if you learn to think intelligently
02:19:51.960 about how to invest successfully in
02:19:54.000 businesses
02:19:55.560 you'll become a much better business
02:19:58.500 manager
02:20:00.420 than you will if you
02:20:02.820 aren't good at
02:20:05.479 uh understanding
02:20:07.859 what's required for successful
02:20:09.479 investment so they're missing a huge
02:20:11.880 opportunity to improve the management
02:20:14.399 profession by doing such a lousy job
02:20:17.760 in teaching investment you see Charlie
02:20:20.160 and I see CEOs all the time who
02:20:23.340 who in a sense don't know how to think
02:20:24.780 about the value of businesses they're
02:20:26.580 acquiring and then you know so they go
02:20:28.080 out and
02:20:29.040 and hire investment bankers and guess
02:20:30.840 what the investment banker tells them
02:20:32.100 what to do it tells them to do it
02:20:34.680 because they get 20x if they do it and X
02:20:37.859 if they don't do it and guess how the
02:20:39.540 advice comes out so it it's uh
02:20:43.680 when a manager of a business feels
02:20:46.080 helpless
02:20:47.580 which you won't say out loud but but
02:20:49.620 inwardly feels helpless in in the
02:20:52.200 question of asset allocation you know
02:20:53.640 you've got a real problem and and their
02:20:55.260 art they have not gone to business
02:20:57.060 schools that have given them
02:20:58.920 any real help I think in in terms of
02:21:01.020 learning how to think about valuation in
02:21:03.840 businesses and that's one of the reasons
02:21:06.240 that the we write and talk about it some
02:21:08.819 because it's there's a gap there
02:21:13.939 when you try and you've got a wonderful
02:21:16.859 business and you is your shares in it to
02:21:18.720 buy another business I I say
02:21:21.899 at least two times out of three it's a
02:21:24.120 terrible idea well Geico is a great
02:21:26.819 example Geico is a wonderful business
02:21:30.240 uh
02:21:31.680 absolutely wonderful it's more Wonderful
02:21:33.540 by the day has the world's best manager
02:21:35.160 Tony nicely running it Geico
02:21:38.580 in the last 20 years
02:21:40.439 went into three at least three other
02:21:42.240 insurance businesses I can think of they
02:21:43.859 went into Resolute insurance which was a
02:21:45.899 reinsurance operation started in the mid
02:21:47.880 80s it was a disaster
02:21:50.220 they went into two others Southern
02:21:52.800 something or other and another one that
02:21:54.600 started with an M you know they I don't
02:21:56.399 know why in the hell they would go into
02:21:57.600 them I mean they had a great great
02:21:59.040 Insurance business and there aren't that
02:22:00.359 many great Insurance businesses and that
02:22:02.040 neither one of those amounted to
02:22:03.180 anything I think there's you know they
02:22:04.380 sold them off at some point but why
02:22:06.540 would you have an absolutely wonderful
02:22:08.160 business and
02:22:09.600 and start one and buy two others that
02:22:12.300 are obviously
02:22:13.859 mediocre where you bring nothing to the
02:22:16.140 party but Management's it's it's it's
02:22:18.420 very human to want to do that it's no
02:22:20.700 it's no great sin that the Geico
02:22:22.560 management did it because we see it
02:22:23.819 happen Time After Time After Time
02:22:26.220 I can tell you this Charlie and I have
02:22:28.020 no urges like that I mean we want to buy
02:22:30.479 easy things we do not have to prove our
02:22:32.340 manhood by doing something terribly
02:22:33.899 difficult
02:22:35.060 and I think a lot of managements feel
02:22:37.859 that necessity they've got a wonderful
02:22:39.300 business the cigarette companies did
02:22:41.160 that cigarette companies had these great
02:22:42.479 businesses and you know they it it
02:22:45.479 irritated them that they uh
02:22:48.240 they they like to think they were
02:22:49.859 business Jesus said so they would go out
02:22:51.540 and buy other things and those other
02:22:52.800 businesses generally did not do that
02:22:54.300 well I'm not saying they should have
02:22:55.560 been in the cigarette business in the
02:22:56.700 first place but they were not business
02:22:58.260 Geniuses because they got to make a lot
02:23:00.120 of money selling an addictive you know
02:23:02.100 product that did not make them business
02:23:03.720 Geniuses and so they wanted to prove it
02:23:05.399 other ways and they they bought
02:23:06.780 businesses and fell on their face in
02:23:08.220 many cases
02:23:09.300 Charlie do you have any more to add on
02:23:10.620 cigarette coming
02:23:12.600 no but I think a lot of people rise to
02:23:14.939 the top in in public we held
02:23:17.399 corporations
02:23:19.200 who come up in sales or organize you
02:23:22.800 know engineering or drug development or
02:23:25.620 what have you
02:23:27.180 and it's natural to assume once you're
02:23:29.040 sitting in the top chair that now you
02:23:31.200 know pretty much everything
02:23:34.380 or at least how to get wisdom out of
02:23:36.899 this wonderful staff
02:23:38.340 and all these outside advisors that are
02:23:40.439 now available to you and so I think it's
02:23:42.660 very natural at perfectly terrible
02:23:44.520 acquisition
02:23:45.840 decisions get made
02:23:48.000 I'd say more often than not
02:23:52.439 area six
02:23:55.319 yeah we had a break in about five
02:23:56.640 minutes well in fact we'll do this
02:23:58.260 question then we'll break
02:23:59.640 okay my name's Paul thomasic from
02:24:02.640 Illinois I'd like to talk about your
02:24:04.680 thinking if you don't mind
02:24:06.300 in the Fortune magazine article that you
02:24:09.120 sent to all the shareholders you
02:24:10.979 referenced a practice by Darwin that
02:24:13.740 when he found something that was
02:24:15.359 contrary to his established conclusions
02:24:17.880 he quickly wrote it down because the
02:24:20.100 mind would have pushed it out
02:24:21.840 and if you read the Origin of Species
02:24:23.880 Darwin's very careful to avoid fooling
02:24:26.520 himself he very carefully asked and
02:24:30.720 answers the hard questions it's a
02:24:32.819 feedback mechanism and you've picked up
02:24:34.740 on one of his feedback mechanisms to
02:24:37.140 avoid fooling yourself so the two
02:24:39.180 questions are this
02:24:40.680 if you look at model how you think
02:24:43.020 Charlie thinks how physicists thinks how
02:24:46.080 mathematicians think you see the same
02:24:48.359 pattern you want to use logic you're
02:24:50.939 dedicated to logic but logic's not
02:24:53.280 enough you have to avoid fooling
02:24:55.260 yourself so you build feedback
02:24:57.359 mechanisms so the first question is do
02:25:00.359 you see it that way that you're thinking
02:25:01.979 just like mathematicians physicists and
02:25:04.859 some of the other exceptional
02:25:05.760 businessmen by being logical and being
02:25:09.180 careful to have feedback mechanism and
02:25:11.520 the second question is about other
02:25:12.840 feedback mechanisms your partnership
02:25:15.840 sitting next to you is is a great
02:25:17.819 feedback mechanism it's hard to fool
02:25:19.859 yourself when you partner with Charlie
02:25:20.939 Munger right this meetings are hard to
02:25:23.939 fool him too
02:25:26.760 but that's not an accident
02:25:29.399 um the meeting on one levels of feedback
02:25:31.380 mechanism the way you attack the annual
02:25:33.600 report letter is a feedback mechanism so
02:25:36.000 could you comment both of you on other
02:25:37.500 feedback mechanisms you develop thank
02:25:39.540 you well you've come up with two very
02:25:40.920 good ones I mean there's no question
02:25:42.120 that that
02:25:45.600 Charlie will not accept anything I say
02:25:48.720 because I say it
02:25:50.100 uh whereas a lot of other people will
02:25:51.840 you know I mean it's just the way the
02:25:53.399 world Works they and it's it's terrific
02:25:57.000 to have a partner
02:25:58.500 who will uh
02:26:01.319 uh say you know you're not thinking
02:26:02.700 straight uh
02:26:04.800 it doesn't happen very often the there's
02:26:08.100 no question the human might what the
02:26:10.260 human being is best at doing
02:26:12.620 is interpreting all new information so
02:26:15.720 that their prior conclusions remain
02:26:17.280 intact I mean that is that is a talent
02:26:19.800 everyone seems to have mastered and and
02:26:21.660 how do we guard ourselves against it
02:26:23.399 well we don't we don't achieve it
02:26:24.600 perfectly I mean Charlie and I have made
02:26:26.160 big mistakes
02:26:27.540 because in effect we have been unwilling
02:26:30.899 to uh to look afresh at something uh
02:26:36.359 uh you know that happens but we do have
02:26:39.359 I think the annual report is a good
02:26:40.859 feedback mechanism I think that
02:26:42.960 reporting on yourself
02:26:45.420 and particularly being reported honestly
02:26:47.220 whether you do it through an annual
02:26:48.300 report or do it through some other
02:26:49.560 mechanism is is very useful but that I
02:26:52.200 would say
02:26:53.880 a partner
02:26:55.800 who is not
02:26:57.899 subservient and who himself is extremely
02:27:01.200 logical
02:27:02.760 you know it's probably the the best
02:27:04.800 mechanism you can have and I would say
02:27:07.500 that I
02:27:09.240 on the contrary to get back to looking
02:27:11.520 things you have to
02:27:13.080 have to uh
02:27:15.060 be sure you don't fall into I would say
02:27:18.240 the typical corporate organization is
02:27:21.060 designed so that the CEO
02:27:25.380 uh
02:27:27.420 opinions and biases and previous beliefs
02:27:30.420 are reinforced in every possible way I
02:27:32.640 mean uh having staffs around you that
02:27:36.840 know what you want to do
02:27:39.020 uh you are not going to get a lot of uh
02:27:43.020 you're getting a lot of contrary
02:27:44.399 thinking I mean most
02:27:46.560 most staffs if they know you want to buy
02:27:48.720 a company
02:27:49.920 you're going to get a recommendation
02:27:51.060 whatever your hurdle right there but
02:27:52.380 it's 15 internal rate of return which
02:27:55.080 very few deals ever work out at you know
02:27:57.479 or 12 or you're gonna they're gonna come
02:28:00.060 back and and they're going to come back
02:28:01.620 with whatever they feel that you want
02:28:03.060 and if you arrange your organization so
02:28:06.000 that you basically
02:28:07.740 have a bunch of uh you know sycophants
02:28:10.880 who are
02:28:12.840 are cloaked in other you know uh titles
02:28:18.420 uh you're not going to get
02:28:21.180 you're going to leave your prior
02:28:22.500 conclusions intact and you're going to
02:28:24.060 get whatever you go in with your biases
02:28:25.920 wanting and the board is not going to be
02:28:28.260 much of a check on that uh
02:28:30.600 uh I've seen very very few boards that
02:28:33.300 can stand up to the CEO on something
02:28:35.640 that's important to the CEO and just say
02:28:37.740 you know you're not going to get it so I
02:28:40.080 you've hit on a terribly important point
02:28:42.600 that uh you know all of us in this room
02:28:47.160 want to read new information and have it
02:28:49.500 confirm our cherished beliefs I mean it
02:28:51.660 is just built into the the human system
02:28:54.979 uh and that can be
02:28:58.460 very expensive uh in the investment and
02:29:02.340 business world and like I say I think
02:29:05.220 we've got a
02:29:06.660 a pretty good system
02:29:08.640 uh and I think that most of the systems
02:29:11.220 aren't very good that exist in Corporate
02:29:13.140 America uh
02:29:15.420 uh to avoid falling in the Trap you're
02:29:17.100 talking about Charlie
02:29:19.500 yeah I think it also helps to be willing
02:29:22.680 to
02:29:23.880 reverse course
02:29:26.580 even when it's quite painful as we sit
02:29:29.640 here I think Berkshire is the only big
02:29:31.979 Corporation in America that is running
02:29:34.200 off a derivative book
02:29:36.840 and we originally made the decision to
02:29:41.220 allow
02:29:42.300 the general red derivative book to
02:29:44.760 continue
02:29:46.260 it's a very unpleasant thing to do to
02:29:49.340 reverse that decision yet we're
02:29:51.420 perfectly willing to do it nobody else
02:29:53.760 is doing it and yet it's perfectly
02:29:55.859 obvious at least to me
02:29:58.140 to say that derivative Accounting in
02:30:00.359 America is a sewer is an insult to
02:30:03.300 sewage
02:30:06.120 yeah
02:30:06.840 yeah I would I would I would second that
02:30:10.020 I might not have chosen those exact
02:30:11.340 words and we may not even use those
02:30:13.319 words in describing why we got out of it
02:30:15.120 but uh
02:30:17.160 um yeah and and in the first in the
02:30:19.380 first quarter of this year
02:30:21.120 uh will show
02:30:23.220 quite a bit of income
02:30:25.380 and anything we say here we ought to put
02:30:27.180 on the internet Mark but I think we'll
02:30:28.920 show what a hundred and I don't know 60
02:30:30.780 million or something like that of
02:30:33.000 Financial
02:30:34.680 or maybe it's
02:30:36.200 140 I'll take a look here uh
02:30:40.680 yeah what about 160 odd million of
02:30:43.800 of income in that funny little line we
02:30:46.200 have from financials
02:30:48.120 uh income but that will be after an 88
02:30:52.859 million dollar loss
02:30:54.720 in terms of getting the first steps of
02:30:57.899 getting out of the general General re
02:31:00.660 uh what used to be called General
02:31:02.100 refinancial products derivative book
02:31:04.979 you know those losses were there uh I
02:31:08.280 mean some of that is the shutdown loss
02:31:09.899 30 odd 30 million or thereabouts is
02:31:12.000 severance pay and that sort of thing but
02:31:14.580 the truth is that
02:31:17.280 derivative accounting is absolutely
02:31:19.560 terrible in this country and there are a
02:31:20.819 lot of companies that will not want to
02:31:22.380 face up
02:31:23.520 to what would be involved if they
02:31:25.140 actually got out now you're seeing
02:31:26.640 derivative accounting Unwound at Enron
02:31:29.520 in a very major way and believe me it's
02:31:32.640 not being unwounded to profit except to
02:31:34.680 the extent of the bankruptcy court lets
02:31:36.180 them disaffirm certain contracts and I
02:31:38.460 mean it is that
02:31:40.200 there was no place where there was as
02:31:42.720 much potential
02:31:44.160 for phoning numbers uh
02:31:47.700 uh at a place like Enron then in the
02:31:50.160 derivative kind of they were marking the
02:31:52.020 model they were doing all these things
02:31:53.280 you give a whole bunch of Traders
02:31:55.979 the ability to create income by putting
02:31:58.200 Little Numbers down on a piece of paper
02:31:59.700 that nobody can really check
02:32:02.520 and it you know it just it's it can get
02:32:05.040 out of control uh it will get out of
02:32:07.260 control and so we
02:32:09.120 we decided finally to bite the bullet on
02:32:11.939 it and we get out of it and it would
02:32:14.760 incidentally we would not have reported
02:32:16.319 88 million dollars of loss if we'd
02:32:18.060 stayed in it might have reported a tiny
02:32:20.520 profit or something but but uh
02:32:23.399 in the end
02:32:25.920 you know the loss was there and there
02:32:28.620 there will be there could well be some
02:32:31.500 more to come in that because once you
02:32:33.840 get into derivatives I think our longest
02:32:36.000 contract may run 40 years or something
02:32:37.979 like that and then the guy who put the
02:32:39.960 40-year contract on the book probably
02:32:41.460 got paid you know that week
02:32:43.920 for putting it on virtually and uh you
02:32:47.040 know we've got a bunch of assumptions as
02:32:48.479 to how it's all going to work out over
02:32:49.859 40 years it it you couldn't devise a
02:32:52.800 worse system and uh
02:32:55.979 in the end you know we didn't want to be
02:32:57.720 in the business when we got in it and we
02:32:59.220 we're now in the process of getting out
02:33:00.960 but you don't get out of fast out fast
02:33:03.540 of something like this I mean it the
02:33:05.760 uh
02:33:07.020 uh you know it's a little it's a little
02:33:08.819 like hell it's easy to get into and it's
02:33:10.680 hard to get very hard to get out of them
02:33:12.680 well with that we'll go off to lunch and
02:33:15.120 I'll see you here in another half hour
02:33:16.380 or so thanks
02:33:17.910 [Applause]
02:33:21.720 hello Mr Buffett Mr Munger my name is
02:33:24.000 James Claus from New York City and I
02:33:27.780 just wanted to ask you a question both
02:33:29.819 you and Mr Munger have repeatedly said
02:33:31.620 that you don't believe that business
02:33:32.640 valuation is being taught correctly at
02:33:35.160 our universities
02:33:36.600 and as a PhD student at Columbia
02:33:38.640 business school that troubles me
02:33:42.120 understandably because in a couple of
02:33:43.859 years I'll be joining the ranks with
02:33:45.600 those teaching business valuation my
02:33:48.420 question isn't what sources such as
02:33:50.220 Graham or Fisher or Mr monger's talks
02:33:54.180 you would Point people that are teaching
02:33:57.060 business valuation to but do you have
02:33:59.580 any counsel about the techniques
02:34:01.800 of teaching business valuation
02:34:04.680 well I I was lucky I had a sensational
02:34:06.780 teacher in Ben Graham and
02:34:09.660 we had a course there there's at least
02:34:11.399 one fellow up in the audience here that
02:34:13.380 attended with me and
02:34:15.180 and
02:34:16.500 Ben made it terribly interesting because
02:34:18.000 what we did was we walked into that
02:34:19.439 class and we valued companies and he had
02:34:21.780 various little games he would play with
02:34:23.760 us sometimes he would have us evaluate
02:34:25.439 company a and Company B with a whole
02:34:27.240 bunch of figures and then we would find
02:34:28.560 out that A and B with the same company
02:34:31.140 at different points in its history for
02:34:32.819 example and then there were a lot of
02:34:34.920 little
02:34:35.880 uh games he
02:34:37.920 he played to get us to think about
02:34:41.640 what were the key variables and you know
02:34:43.620 how could we go off the track I remember
02:34:45.780 one time Ben met with uh
02:34:48.420 with Charlie and me and about nine or so
02:34:51.660 other people down in San Diego and in
02:34:53.780 1968 or so and he gave
02:34:56.340 gave all of us a little true false test
02:34:58.380 and we all thought we were pretty smart
02:34:59.700 and we all flunked but that was his way
02:35:01.859 of teaching us that
02:35:03.420 teaching us that a
02:35:05.340 a smart man playing his own game and and
02:35:08.460 working at fooling you could do a pretty
02:35:10.859 good job at it but I would you know if I
02:35:13.979 were teaching your course on investments
02:35:16.380 there would be simply one valuation
02:35:19.319 study after another with with the
02:35:21.479 students
02:35:22.380 trying to
02:35:25.020 identify the key variables in that
02:35:28.260 particular business and uh evaluating
02:35:32.460 how predictable they were first because
02:35:34.500 that is the first step if something is
02:35:36.120 not very predictable forget it you know
02:35:38.100 you don't have to be right about every
02:35:39.660 company you have to make a few good
02:35:40.979 decisions in your lifetime
02:35:42.660 but then when you find the important
02:35:44.640 thing is to know when you find one where
02:35:46.020 you really do know the key variables
02:35:48.000 which ones are important and you and you
02:35:49.979 do think you've got to fix on them
02:35:52.460 where we've been where we've done well
02:35:55.439 Charlie and I made a dozen or so
02:35:59.160 very big decisions relative to net worth
02:36:01.200 but not as big as they should have been
02:36:02.580 and
02:36:04.859 we've known we were right based on those
02:36:06.960 going in I mean they did they just
02:36:08.580 weren't that complicated and we knew we
02:36:10.319 were focusing on the right variables and
02:36:12.600 they were dominant
02:36:14.220 and we know that even though we couldn't
02:36:16.740 take it out to five decimal places or
02:36:18.780 anything like that we we knew that in
02:36:20.520 the general way we were right about them
02:36:21.960 and that's what we look for the fat
02:36:23.819 pitch and that's what I would be
02:36:26.160 teaching trying to teach students to do
02:36:27.899 and I would not try to teach them to
02:36:29.640 think they could do the impossible
02:36:31.020 Charlie
02:36:32.880 yes if you're
02:36:34.920 planning to teach business valuation and
02:36:38.760 what you hope to do is uh
02:36:41.939 teach the way people teach real estate
02:36:43.920 appraising so you can take any company
02:36:46.680 and your students after studying your
02:36:49.380 course will be able to
02:36:51.060 give you an appraisal of
02:36:52.920 of that company which will indicate
02:36:57.120 oh
02:37:00.720 really it's future prospects
02:37:03.000 compared to its uh market price I think
02:37:06.420 you're attempting The Impossible
02:37:09.240 you're probably on the final exam I
02:37:10.920 would I would take an internet company
02:37:12.960 and I would say the final exam the
02:37:14.520 question is how much is this worth
02:37:16.500 and anybody that gave me an answer I
02:37:18.180 would flunk
02:37:20.399 right
02:37:21.520 [Applause]
02:37:26.580 make grading papers easy too
02:37:32.520 my name is Phil Young from LA California
02:37:38.700 Mr Warren Buffett Mr
02:37:43.920 I am one of the poor persons who highly
02:37:48.439 admire you both
02:37:51.899 I have two questions
02:37:54.359 question one
02:37:56.939 you of you on World Financial business
02:38:01.260 involvement in the next decade
02:38:05.340 question two
02:38:07.560 U.S position
02:38:09.780 for economic competition in the next
02:38:12.600 decade thank you
02:38:15.060 well you've asked two big questions but
02:38:17.280 but you're going to get very small
02:38:18.359 answers I'm afraid and that's no
02:38:20.640 disrespect but we we just we don't have
02:38:23.220 that we don't think about those things
02:38:25.080 very much we we just we just are looking
02:38:27.359 for decent businesses and incidentally
02:38:29.399 our views in the past wouldn't have been
02:38:30.899 any good
02:38:31.859 on those subjects and
02:38:33.960 we try to we try to think about two
02:38:35.880 things we try to think about things that
02:38:38.280 are important and things that are
02:38:39.960 knowable
02:38:41.100 now there are things that are important
02:38:42.720 that are not knowable in our view those
02:38:44.880 two questions that you raised fall on
02:38:46.560 that there are things that are knowable
02:38:47.880 but not important we don't want to cut
02:38:49.260 our minds up with those so we're we say
02:38:52.319 what is important and what is knowable
02:38:54.720 and
02:38:56.520 what among the things that fall within
02:38:58.979 those two categories can we translate
02:39:00.720 into some kind of an action that is is
02:39:03.660 useful for Berkshire and and we really
02:39:06.240 there are all kinds of important
02:39:07.560 subjects
02:39:08.580 that Charlie and I we don't know
02:39:10.140 anything about
02:39:11.340 and and therefore we don't think about
02:39:13.319 them so we have our view about what the
02:39:15.540 world will look like over the next 10
02:39:16.979 years in in business or competitive
02:39:18.899 situations
02:39:19.979 we're just no good we do think we know
02:39:22.080 something about what Coca-Cola is going
02:39:23.280 to look like in 10 years or what your
02:39:24.540 what's going to look like in 10 years or
02:39:25.740 what Disney's going to look like in 10
02:39:27.000 years or what some of our operating
02:39:28.439 subsidiaries are going to look like in
02:39:29.819 10 years we care a lot about that we
02:39:31.500 think a lot about that we want to be
02:39:33.420 right about that
02:39:34.979 we're right about that
02:39:36.660 the other things get to be
02:39:38.580 uh you know they're they're just they're
02:39:41.580 they're less important and and if we
02:39:45.240 started focusing on those
02:39:47.340 we would miss a lot of big things I've
02:39:49.140 used this example before but
02:39:51.540 Coca-Cola went public and I think it was
02:39:53.580 1919.
02:39:55.620 and the first year
02:39:58.439 one share costs forty dollars
02:40:00.780 the first year it went down a little
02:40:02.280 over 50 at the end of the year it was
02:40:03.899 down to 19 there were some problems with
02:40:06.240 bottler contracts there's problems with
02:40:07.680 sugar various kinds of problems
02:40:09.960 if you'd had perfect foresight
02:40:13.020 you would have seen the world's greatest
02:40:15.060 depression
02:40:16.500 staring you in the face when when the
02:40:18.600 social order even got questioned you
02:40:20.100 would have seen
02:40:21.540 World War II you would have seen atomic
02:40:24.240 bombs and and hydrogen bombs you would
02:40:27.420 have seen all kinds of things
02:40:29.340 and you could always find a reason to
02:40:32.040 postpone
02:40:33.240 uh why you should buy that Shira
02:40:34.979 Coca-Cola but the important thing wasn't
02:40:36.120 to see that the important thing was to
02:40:37.380 see if they were going to be selling a
02:40:38.520 billion eight ounce servings of
02:40:39.899 beverages a day this year or some large
02:40:43.140 number
02:40:44.280 and that the person who could make
02:40:47.040 people happy a billion times a day
02:40:49.439 around the globe ought to make a few
02:40:50.760 bucks off doing it and so that forty
02:40:53.399 dollars which went down to 19 I think
02:40:55.439 with dividends reinvested has to be well
02:40:57.359 over five million dollars now and if you
02:40:59.880 developed a view on these other subjects
02:41:02.580 that in any way
02:41:04.680 forestall do acting on this more
02:41:06.780 important specific narrow
02:41:09.899 view about the future of the company
02:41:13.080 uh you would have missed either missed a
02:41:14.819 great ride so that's that's the kind of
02:41:16.560 thing we focus on Charlie yeah we're not
02:41:19.020 predicting the currents that will come
02:41:21.120 just how some things will swim in the
02:41:23.640 currents whatever they are
02:41:27.380 good morning my name is Ronald Towell
02:41:30.120 I'm from Brooklyn New York I'm very uh
02:41:32.880 appreciative of your graciousness as a
02:41:35.100 host for this wonderful weekend
02:41:37.140 my question has to do with the
02:41:38.790 [Applause]
02:41:44.520 my question has to do with the retailing
02:41:46.380 industry particularly the department
02:41:48.060 stores and mass merchants
02:41:50.160 my question has two parts
02:41:52.380 without resorting to comments about
02:41:54.060 specific companies may I ask your
02:41:55.979 opinion as to the long-term prospects
02:41:57.899 for growth and profitability of this
02:41:59.760 Industry Group
02:42:01.020 the second part of my question is given
02:42:04.260 the fact that it is difficult to pick up
02:42:05.819 a newspaper or to be an investor without
02:42:07.800 being bombarded by what is purported to
02:42:10.260 be the potential for exponential growth
02:42:12.359 in the internet E-Business particularly
02:42:14.399 directly to Consumers
02:42:16.439 which could possibly eat into the
02:42:18.180 revenues of these retailers and if even
02:42:21.300 if we assume a relatively low impact of
02:42:23.399 say five to ten percent Revenue
02:42:25.140 reductions
02:42:26.520 and given the fact that Top Line growth
02:42:28.680 is critical to any business especially
02:42:30.660 the bricks and mortar retailers with
02:42:33.359 their High proportions of fixed overhead
02:42:35.180 what advice could you give to a CEO of
02:42:38.040 such a company and in turn based on the
02:42:40.800 preceding scenario what would be your
02:42:42.479 opinion of the medium and long-term
02:42:44.340 prospects for this industry
02:42:47.040 well that's a good question too and
02:42:51.120 obviously the internet is going to have
02:42:54.660 an important impact on retailing it will
02:42:57.240 have
02:42:58.319 a huge impact on some forms of retailing
02:43:00.899 change them in maybe revolutionize them
02:43:05.040 I think there's some other areas where
02:43:06.680 the impact will be less but anytime we
02:43:09.660 buy into a business and anytime we
02:43:12.359 bought in for some time
02:43:14.160 we have tried to think of what
02:43:17.160 that business is going to look like in 5
02:43:19.319 or 10 or 15 years and
02:43:21.899 we recognize
02:43:23.880 that the internet in many forms of
02:43:26.399 retailing
02:43:27.479 is likely to pose such a threat
02:43:30.180 that we simply wouldn't want to get into
02:43:31.920 the business I mean it
02:43:34.460 not that we can measure it perfectly but
02:43:36.960 but there are a number of retailing
02:43:39.240 operations that we think are threatened
02:43:41.819 and we do not think that's the case in
02:43:45.000 Furniture retailing and we have three
02:43:46.979 very important operations there we could
02:43:49.260 be wrong but uh so far that you know
02:43:52.260 that would be my judgment that furniture
02:43:53.640 retailing will not be hurt you've seen
02:43:55.800 other forms of retailing where you're
02:43:57.120 already starting to see some inroads
02:43:59.700 being made but but it's just started the
02:44:02.100 internet is going to be a huge force in
02:44:04.560 many Arenas but it'll certainly be a
02:44:06.600 huge Force in retailing now it may
02:44:09.120 benefit us
02:44:10.640 in certain areas I would expect the
02:44:13.140 internet
02:44:14.220 to benefit
02:44:15.740 abortiones in a very big way and you
02:44:18.120 noticed in the in the movie that we
02:44:20.040 talked about borsheims.com coming online
02:44:22.620 in in May there's something up there now
02:44:24.780 but you'll see a new format uh within a
02:44:28.140 month or so
02:44:29.220 now you might
02:44:30.540 say in in jewelry retailing
02:44:33.420 you know with millions of things that
02:44:35.880 you can click onto
02:44:37.500 10 years from now you know who is going
02:44:39.899 to be important in terms of online
02:44:43.080 uh retailing of jewelry I would argue
02:44:45.180 that
02:44:46.080 that two firms
02:44:49.200 have a an enormous Advantage going in I
02:44:52.979 would argue that Tiffany has such an
02:44:54.720 advantage we don't own any Tiffany but I
02:44:56.580 would say that because of their name
02:44:58.080 brand names are going to mean very very
02:45:00.479 much when you have literally you know
02:45:03.300 thousands and thousands of choices
02:45:04.740 people can't they have to trust somebody
02:45:06.979 and I think that Tiffany has a name that
02:45:09.720 that people would trust and I think
02:45:11.939 borsheim's has a name that people with
02:45:14.460 trust and borsheim sells jewelry a whole
02:45:16.680 lot cheaper than Tiffany so I would say
02:45:18.420 that that people who are price conscious
02:45:22.020 but also want to deal deal with a
02:45:25.260 jeweler that they trust implicitly will
02:45:27.780 find their way to to uh to borsheims in
02:45:32.280 increasing numbers uh over the internet
02:45:34.560 and I would say that people that like
02:45:36.060 the blue box you know are going to find
02:45:37.920 their way to Tiffany's uh over time and
02:45:40.140 they'll pay more money
02:45:41.540 but I don't see them going for Brand X
02:45:45.120 in buying Fine Jewelry over the Internet
02:45:47.640 so I think that with the brand that
02:45:50.520 borsheims has and with with the careful
02:45:53.939 nurturing of that brand I I would say
02:45:55.740 that the internet
02:45:57.300 offers borsheims a chance to have the
02:46:00.060 advantage in cost that comes from a huge
02:46:03.000 one-store location and yet
02:46:06.000 also go into the homes of people in in
02:46:08.520 every part of the world and uh that kind
02:46:11.399 of a company should prosper
02:46:13.979 um
02:46:14.819 there are other of our companies I worry
02:46:17.100 about you know I can worry about them
02:46:19.140 being heard in various ways Geico is a
02:46:21.479 is going to be a big beneficiary of the
02:46:23.160 internet we already are developing
02:46:24.540 substantial business through it but I I
02:46:27.479 if I were to buy buy into any retailing
02:46:29.939 business
02:46:30.840 whether I was buying the stock of it or
02:46:32.520 buying the whole business I would think
02:46:33.840 very hard
02:46:35.100 about what people are going to be trying
02:46:37.859 to do to that business through the
02:46:40.500 internet and and you know it affects it
02:46:43.319 affects real estate that is dedicated to
02:46:45.300 retailing and if you uh substitute five
02:46:49.260 percent of the retail volume uh uh via
02:46:53.520 the Internet where real estate is
02:46:54.840 essentially free they're they're you
02:46:57.300 know you can have a store in in every in
02:47:00.420 every town in the world through the
02:47:01.920 internet without having any rental
02:47:03.120 expense uh so I would be think I would I
02:47:06.420 would give a lot of thought to that if I
02:47:08.040 were if I were owning a lot of retail a
02:47:11.100 rental space Charlie
02:47:13.979 well I think it is uh
02:47:18.240 tricky predicting that
02:47:21.500 technological change either will or
02:47:24.540 won't destroy some business when I was
02:47:27.060 young the department stores
02:47:29.939 had a bunch of sort of monopolistic
02:47:31.800 advantages
02:47:33.060 a they were downtown where the streetcar
02:47:34.979 lines met B they had sort of a monopoly
02:47:37.800 on extending revolving credit and D they
02:47:40.560 had one stop shopping and all kinds of
02:47:42.840 weather
02:47:43.620 and nobody else did and they lost all
02:47:47.100 three of those advantages and
02:47:50.040 yet they've done well a lot of them for
02:47:52.200 many decades since
02:47:55.140 at other times you get a change and you
02:47:57.899 just get destroyed our trading stamp
02:48:00.060 business was destroyed by changes in the
02:48:03.380 economic world and our world book
02:48:05.580 business has been seriously hurt by the
02:48:08.340 personal computer and the CD-ROM and so
02:48:11.399 forth
02:48:15.000 yeah I agree it's a big risk but it's
02:48:17.100 it's not easy to uh
02:48:20.880 to make predictions in which you have
02:48:22.920 great confidence
02:48:24.840 if you go down to 16th and Farnam area
02:48:26.700 where the streetcar tracks used to cross
02:48:28.439 that was the that was the best real
02:48:30.600 estate in town and
02:48:32.160 and people sign 100 Year 50-year leases
02:48:34.319 on it and it it looked like there was
02:48:35.939 nothing more safe because they weren't
02:48:37.200 going to move the streetcar lines
02:48:39.000 the only thing was that they moved the
02:48:40.439 streetcars they just took and converted
02:48:43.020 them into junk
02:48:44.600 and it seemed very permanent the
02:48:46.680 advantage of the big department store
02:48:48.000 the Marshall Field in Chicago or the
02:48:49.740 Macy's in New York was this incredible
02:48:51.720 breadth of merchandise you could go and
02:48:53.939 you could find 300 different types of
02:48:56.340 spools of thread or 500 different you
02:48:58.319 can see 500 different wedding dresses or
02:49:00.060 whatever and you had these million
02:49:01.620 square foot and even 2 million square
02:49:03.060 foot
02:49:04.080 downtown stores and they were these huge
02:49:06.120 emporiums and then the shopping center
02:49:08.220 came along and of course the shopping
02:49:09.540 center created in effect
02:49:12.060 a store of many stores and so you had
02:49:14.460 millions of square feet now and and but
02:49:16.500 you still had this incredible variety
02:49:18.120 being offered
02:49:19.920 the internet becomes a store in your you
02:49:22.380 know in your computer and it has an
02:49:25.020 incredible variety of of offerings too
02:49:27.240 some of them don't lend themselves very
02:49:28.859 well it seems to me too the retailing
02:49:31.620 and and you know and others do uh uh but
02:49:34.439 Charlie's right it it it's hard to
02:49:36.120 predict exactly how it will turn out I
02:49:37.740 would expect
02:49:38.819 I would expect
02:49:40.680 you know automobile retailing to change
02:49:43.560 and
02:49:44.520 in some important ways and in part in in
02:49:47.580 very significant part influenced by the
02:49:49.740 internet but I wouldn't
02:49:51.300 you know I can't predict exactly how
02:49:52.859 that will happen but uh I don't think
02:49:55.800 it'll look the same
02:49:57.540 10 or 15 years from now
02:50:00.780 zones
02:50:02.580 good morning my name is Jad Corey I'm
02:50:05.580 from Gaithersburg Maryland I just want
02:50:08.520 to thank you for sharing your wisdom
02:50:11.100 and my question is um
02:50:14.520 what criteria do you use to sell stock
02:50:19.319 I kind of understand how you buy it but
02:50:22.319 I'm not sure how you spell yeah well the
02:50:24.960 best thing to do is buy a stock that you
02:50:26.700 don't ever want to sell I mean that and
02:50:28.380 that's what we're trying to do
02:50:29.880 uh and that's true when we buy an entire
02:50:31.920 business I mean we've bought all of
02:50:33.300 Geico we bought all of C's candy or the
02:50:35.280 Buffalo news we're not buying those to
02:50:37.439 resell I mean what we're trying to do is
02:50:39.359 buy a business that we will be happy
02:50:40.979 with
02:50:42.000 if we own it the rest of our lives and
02:50:43.560 we expect to with those it's the same
02:50:45.600 principle applies to marketable
02:50:47.040 Securities you get extra options with
02:50:49.560 marketable Securities you can you you
02:50:51.240 can add the Holdings obviously easier we
02:50:53.939 can never own more than 100 of a
02:50:55.620 business but if we own two percent of a
02:50:57.060 business and we like it at a given price
02:50:59.160 we can add and have four or five percent
02:51:01.439 so that's that's a that's an advantage
02:51:03.899 sometimes if we if we need money to move
02:51:06.479 to another sector like we did last year
02:51:08.280 we will trim from some Holdings but that
02:51:10.500 doesn't mean we're negative on those
02:51:11.640 businesses at all I mean we think
02:51:12.960 they're wonderful businesses or we
02:51:14.160 wouldn't own them and
02:51:16.380 we would sell
02:51:18.359 uh a if we needed money for other things
02:51:20.700 the Geico stock that I bought in 19
02:51:24.060 51 I sold
02:51:26.399 in 1952 it was you know went on to be
02:51:29.700 worth 100 or more times before the 1976
02:51:33.240 problems 100 or more times what I'd paid
02:51:35.220 but I didn't have the money to do
02:51:36.840 something else so you sell if you need
02:51:38.399 money for something else you may sell
02:51:40.740 if you believe that valuations between
02:51:43.200 different kinds of markets are are
02:51:45.120 somewhat out of whack
02:51:46.560 and uh you know we we have done a little
02:51:49.260 trimming last year uh uh in that matter
02:51:53.160 but that will be a mistake I mean the
02:51:55.380 real thing to do with a great business
02:51:56.819 is just hang on for dear life Charlie
02:52:00.060 yes but this the sales that do happen
02:52:03.600 the ideal is when you found something
02:52:05.760 you like immensely better
02:52:09.479 isn't that obvious that's the that's the
02:52:12.120 ideal way to sell
02:52:13.560 and incidentally the ideal purchase is
02:52:15.479 defined as is to have something that you
02:52:17.880 already like be selling at a price where
02:52:19.740 you feel like buying more of it I mean
02:52:21.420 that uh
02:52:22.500 we probably should have done more of
02:52:23.760 that in the past and in some situations
02:52:25.740 but that's the beauty of marketable
02:52:27.720 Securities you really do if you're in a
02:52:29.340 wonderful business you do get a chance
02:52:30.740 periodically maybe to double up in it or
02:52:33.180 something to sort uh if if the market
02:52:36.000 the stock market would sell a lot
02:52:37.800 cheaper than it is now
02:52:39.359 we would probably be buying more of the
02:52:41.880 businesses that were all we that we
02:52:44.760 already own that they would certainly be
02:52:46.439 the first ones that we would think about
02:52:47.640 they're they're the businesses we like
02:52:49.140 the best
02:52:50.700 really nothing more okay Charlie and I
02:52:55.140 I've thought about options all our life
02:52:56.939 I mean my guess is Charlie was thinking
02:52:58.859 about that and
02:53:00.060 in grade school and uh
02:53:03.300 um you know and I I mean you have to
02:53:06.479 understand you don't have to understand
02:53:08.520 Black Shoals at all but you have to
02:53:10.620 understand
02:53:11.939 uh
02:53:13.439 uh the utility
02:53:15.620 uh and in a general sense the value of
02:53:18.840 options and you have to understand the
02:53:21.840 cost of issuing options which is very
02:53:25.140 unpopular subject in certain quarters
02:53:28.640 any option has value I mean I bought a
02:53:31.800 house
02:53:32.700 in 1958 for thirty one thousand five
02:53:35.520 hundred dollars
02:53:36.540 and let's assume the seller of that
02:53:38.279 house has said to me I'd like an option
02:53:39.960 on it
02:53:40.979 good in perpetuity at two hundred
02:53:42.840 thousand dollars
02:53:44.399 well that wouldn't have seemed like it
02:53:46.200 cost me much if I'd given it to him
02:53:48.779 but an option has value any option has
02:53:51.479 value and that's why
02:53:53.460 some people who are
02:53:55.319 uh
02:53:56.460 you know kind of slick in business
02:53:59.460 matters sometimes get options for very
02:54:01.620 little or for nothing
02:54:03.439 uh I'm talking about stock options I'm
02:54:06.240 just talking about an option to purchase
02:54:08.100 anything they got options for
02:54:11.340 far less than really a market value
02:54:13.979 would be Black Shoals is
02:54:18.840 an attempt to measure the market value
02:54:21.840 of options and it cranks in certain
02:54:25.800 variables but the most important
02:54:27.540 variable that cranks in that that might
02:54:30.060 be subject uh
02:54:32.100 well might be a case where if you had
02:54:33.720 differing views you could make some
02:54:34.859 money but it it it it's based upon the
02:54:37.979 past volatility
02:54:39.600 uh uh of the asset involved and
02:54:43.859 past volatilities are not the best
02:54:46.439 judge a value I mean if you looked at a
02:54:49.140 at a
02:54:50.760 five-year option at Birch on Berkshire
02:54:52.979 stock at various times Berkshire stocks
02:54:54.779 had a fairly low beta as they call it
02:54:56.760 the betas is a measure that
02:54:59.279 people in Academia always like to give
02:55:01.680 Greek names or things that are fairly
02:55:03.180 simple and so that they have sort of a
02:55:04.680 priesthood you know
02:55:06.260 so it's you know it's like priest
02:55:08.399 talking in Latin or something I mean it
02:55:10.080 it it kind of cows the the laity but
02:55:16.260 they
02:55:17.700 beta is a measure of past volatility
02:55:20.399 Berkshires had a low volatility but that
02:55:22.680 didn't mean that the option value of it
02:55:24.899 to anybody that really understood the
02:55:26.520 business
02:55:27.359 was low than than a stock with a higher
02:55:31.560 beta and
02:55:33.000 I think Charlie what Charlie said is
02:55:35.040 that
02:55:35.819 last year is that over that for longer
02:55:38.640 term options in particular
02:55:40.680 uh Black Shoals can give some silly
02:55:44.640 results I mean it it misprices things
02:55:46.740 but it's a mechanical system and any
02:55:49.200 mechanical system in Securities markets
02:55:51.060 is going to misprice things from time to
02:55:52.859 time and that's we we made one as I
02:55:55.800 mentioned last year we made one large
02:55:57.420 commitment
02:55:58.680 that basically was uh
02:56:02.340 uh had somebody on the other side of it
02:56:04.580 using Black Shoals and using market
02:56:07.260 prices
02:56:08.359 took the other side of it and we made
02:56:10.380 120 million dollars last year
02:56:12.979 and we love the idea of other people
02:56:15.779 using mechanistic formulas to price
02:56:18.600 things because they may be right 99
02:56:20.640 times out of 100 but we don't have to
02:56:23.160 play those 99 times we just play the one
02:56:25.140 time when we have a differing View
02:56:27.540 Charlie you want to comment on
02:56:30.840 yeah Black Shoals is a
02:56:33.840 what I would call an a no-nothing value
02:56:36.720 system
02:56:37.740 if you don't know anything at all about
02:56:41.580 value compared with price in other words
02:56:44.520 if if if price is teaching you all that
02:56:48.240 can be known
02:56:49.560 then Black Shoals on a very short-term
02:56:51.779 basis is a pretty good guess you know
02:56:55.200 for what a 90-day option may be worth in
02:56:57.899 some stock or another the minute you get
02:57:00.180 into longer term options
02:57:02.580 where you don't have the know nothing
02:57:05.220 Factor so extreme
02:57:07.680 it's crazy to use Black Shoals
02:57:10.880 people use it just because they want
02:57:13.260 some kind of a mechanical system but at
02:57:16.979 Costco for instance with a fairly short
02:57:19.500 period we issued stock options at 30 and
02:57:23.700 we also issued stock options at 60.
02:57:27.479 and Black Shoals valued the options we
02:57:29.880 issued at 60.
02:57:32.399 was a strike price
02:57:34.140 way higher than me options we
02:57:37.200 issued a 30. well this is insane
02:57:41.700 but we like a certain amount of insanity
02:57:44.000 yeah well it's good for Warren who
02:57:47.100 picked up this extra 120 million dollars
02:57:49.319 but
02:57:51.479 and so he he's he's founder of this kind
02:57:53.819 of insanity than I am
02:57:56.580 no we will pay you real money if you
02:57:58.680 will deliver to our officers at Key West
02:58:00.479 Plaza somebody who wants to use the
02:58:02.040 black shoals model and is willing to
02:58:03.600 price
02:58:04.560 uh a hundred options for three years
02:58:07.319 willing to using the black trolls model
02:58:09.300 and letting us pick and choose
02:58:11.100 among those because as Charlie says it's
02:58:13.380 a know nothing
02:58:14.700 uh Affair and and we are know nothing
02:58:17.520 guys in respect to an awful lot of
02:58:19.979 things but every now and then we find
02:58:21.600 something where we think we know
02:58:22.560 something and and uh and anybody that's
02:58:25.920 using a mechanistic formula is going to
02:58:28.380 get in trouble in in that situation but
02:58:30.720 options have value
02:58:32.279 I mean we we issued options in a sense
02:58:35.160 last year when we when we sold those the
02:58:37.680 400 million of of bonds uh and we know
02:58:42.300 what we're giving up
02:58:43.979 when we when we when we sell those bonds
02:58:46.439 I mean we may have gotten what
02:58:48.420 uh a negative coupon of sorts but but
02:58:51.359 that's because we gave up option value
02:58:53.040 and then uh it wasn't it isn't truly a
02:58:56.760 negative cost instrument at all because
02:58:58.700 options have value
02:59:01.560 let's go to number four
02:59:03.960 hello my name is Martin Wiegand from
02:59:06.479 Bethesda Maryland and first I'd like to
02:59:08.220 thank you and all the folks working here
02:59:10.380 at the microphones and Staffing the
02:59:11.880 booths for hosting this wonderful
02:59:13.740 shareholders weekend we enjoy your
02:59:16.140 efforts Thanks Martin
02:59:18.530 [Applause]
02:59:22.560 my question is about a a company getting
02:59:25.319 its employee compensation
02:59:27.960 aligned with shareholder interest
02:59:29.640 Charlie Munger in one of his outstanding
02:59:31.979 investor digest interviews cites the
02:59:34.080 case of FedEx getting it right in the
02:59:37.080 newspapers we've all just read about
02:59:38.640 American Airlines Bethlehem Steel and a
02:59:40.979 lot of other companies getting it wrong
02:59:43.140 I find precious little written about
02:59:45.260 compensation systems would you share
02:59:47.939 with us how you get it right at
02:59:50.100 Berkshire companies also your old golf
02:59:53.580 coach and racetrack friend Bob Dwyer
02:59:55.920 asked me if you would like to share with
02:59:57.779 us you're picking the Kentucky Derby is
03:00:00.899 Bob is Bob back there with you Martin no
03:00:03.359 in the middle oh Bob yeah Bob Bob and I
03:00:08.160 did spend a lot of time at the racetrack
03:00:09.600 in high school he was a
03:00:11.340 he was not on the basketball coach at
03:00:13.080 Woodrow Wilson High but he was also the
03:00:14.640 golf coach and
03:00:16.140 whenever I wanted to go to the races he
03:00:18.120 would he would write an excuse to my
03:00:20.220 other teachers saying that we had to go
03:00:21.779 out for the golf team
03:00:25.620 and then we would head off to Charleston
03:00:27.240 or Robert aguara Pimlico or someplace
03:00:29.279 and and uh
03:00:33.060 he he cleaned up his act subsequently uh
03:00:36.300 it's good to have Bob with us he was
03:00:38.220 known for his famous three iron shots he
03:00:41.160 was known as trolley wire Dwyer in in in
03:00:43.500 those days Charlie do you want to talk
03:00:45.960 about comp a little
03:00:50.580 well as the shareholders know our system
03:00:53.220 is different from that of
03:00:55.800 most big corporations we think it's less
03:00:58.979 capricious
03:01:01.520 the stock option system
03:01:04.560 will give
03:01:07.020 extraordinarily liberal Awards sort of
03:01:10.140 by accident to some people and it will
03:01:12.720 deny other people any reward at all at
03:01:14.880 some different time in spite of great
03:01:17.819 contributions made by the people who are
03:01:19.979 getting nothing so except where we
03:01:23.100 inherited we just don't use it but we
03:01:27.420 must be in a minority far less than one
03:01:30.060 percent right it's where we like to be
03:01:31.979 right oh they it's interesting we
03:01:35.399 inherited some stock options at
03:01:36.960 Berkshire primarily in the general
03:01:38.520 re-transaction
03:01:40.260 and not through any failing of anybody
03:01:43.380 or or or there's no dispersion to be
03:01:46.260 cast but at all but those options turned
03:01:50.040 out to be quite valuable
03:01:52.500 they would not have been valuable if
03:01:54.359 General Reed had been left alone as a
03:01:55.859 standalone company
03:01:57.120 uh they were they profited from the fact
03:02:00.420 that other parts of Berkshire did well
03:02:02.819 and the money went to the people that
03:02:04.859 had these options who delivered nothing
03:02:07.380 to the performance of Berkshire for a
03:02:09.120 while now that's that's that is not an
03:02:11.580 indictment of anybody in the least a
03:02:13.200 genre it's an indictment of an option
03:02:15.300 system which represents a lottery ticket
03:02:17.760 and also a royalty on the passage of
03:02:19.920 time because as you know
03:02:22.080 an option holder
03:02:24.240 has benefits from retained earnings and
03:02:27.300 benefits not at all from dividends
03:02:31.680 and that puts his interest
03:02:34.200 well maybe quite contrary to that of the
03:02:36.479 shareholders so
03:02:39.120 We Believe
03:02:40.620 in paying for performance but we believe
03:02:43.560 in tiring performance to what is
03:02:46.260 actually under the reasonable control of
03:02:49.439 the person that's being measured and and
03:02:52.500 we
03:02:54.300 to give a lottery ticket
03:02:56.819 on on the overall results of Berkshire
03:02:59.279 Hathaway
03:03:00.740 to someone who is running a business
03:03:02.939 that's one percent of the whole
03:03:05.279 is really crazy and and I would say that
03:03:08.160 you have seen
03:03:10.140 probably more misdirected
03:03:13.399 compensation throughout the corporate
03:03:16.020 system Corporate America in the last
03:03:18.120 five years you know then in the hundred
03:03:20.640 years before that it's been
03:03:22.620 extraordinary and uh
03:03:25.399 there was there there was wealth
03:03:27.600 creation
03:03:29.040 in the 90s just like in the 80s and the
03:03:31.380 70s and the 60s and the 50s but there
03:03:33.600 was a wealth transfer
03:03:35.880 like I've never been experienced before
03:03:39.359 and you know you can't blame people for
03:03:41.580 wanting to cash in on it you know if
03:03:44.640 anybody wants to walk up and hand me a
03:03:46.319 half a dozen lottery tickets for the
03:03:47.700 Nebraska Lottery you know I'll accept
03:03:49.680 them but it will have nothing to do with
03:03:51.960 how I do in terms of running Berkshire
03:03:54.180 uh actually Charlie and I think a
03:03:57.720 properly designed option system
03:04:00.660 which includes cost of capital and some
03:04:02.760 other factors and and ties it to the
03:04:04.740 performance of the people involved we
03:04:07.680 think that can make sense when we've
03:04:09.899 used various incentive programs that are
03:04:11.760 similar to that
03:04:13.260 but the idea of just passing them out
03:04:15.840 and telling people that for 10 years
03:04:17.460 they get a free ride and then repricing
03:04:19.979 you know if your stock goes down their
03:04:21.840 stock doesn't go down their option price
03:04:23.399 goes down you know that is not our idea
03:04:25.859 of a great compensation system
03:04:29.100 yeah if we're if we're right with our
03:04:31.319 general approach
03:04:33.000 uh
03:04:35.700 it has considerably important
03:04:37.680 implications
03:04:39.300 because
03:04:40.740 the natural implication is that more
03:04:43.800 than 99 of corporate compensation
03:04:46.140 systems are more than a little crazy in
03:04:48.899 America
03:04:50.279 and and I want to emphasize that
03:04:53.340 Berkshire is not illiberal I mean we've
03:04:55.140 got various incentive systems out where
03:04:57.720 people make tens of millions and they
03:05:00.660 make hundreds of Millions
03:05:02.640 so we're not against
03:05:05.520 rewards for people who make vast
03:05:08.700 contributions but a system that's
03:05:11.399 basically capricious
03:05:13.260 and which doesn't tailor the
03:05:17.760 results per person
03:05:20.040 and per activity very well we just think
03:05:22.680 it's crazy
03:05:23.760 we love to see people
03:05:25.979 that are associated with Berkshire
03:05:27.479 making money as long as they're making
03:05:29.700 money for you at the same time it's very
03:05:31.500 simple and but we don't want them to get
03:05:33.960 a free ride off your money
03:05:41.040 compensation is an interesting subject
03:05:42.899 and I'm going to write about it next
03:05:44.160 year or something but you know it
03:05:47.580 it's not a market system you can read
03:05:49.560 all you want I mean you know the the pr
03:05:52.500 people will tell you you know that ex
03:05:54.600 Joe Smith's
03:05:56.399 conversation was determined by a market
03:05:58.319 system and he's just like a baseball
03:05:59.640 player or anything of the sort but he's
03:06:01.140 not just like a baseball player and the
03:06:03.359 baseball player negotiates with somebody
03:06:05.819 who's spending his money
03:06:08.100 to hire the baseball player making a
03:06:10.319 calculation whether he's better off
03:06:12.300 laying out the money out of his own
03:06:13.740 pocket the owner of the team to get that
03:06:16.500 player but when you get a cop committee
03:06:19.140 at a large American corporation
03:06:23.220 you have somebody with an enormous
03:06:25.680 interest in the amount of comp on one
03:06:27.420 side of the table and you've got
03:06:28.560 somebody on the other side of the table
03:06:30.600 who was not picked because they were the
03:06:32.340 Doberman of the board believe me uh and
03:06:35.340 who is dealing with what
03:06:37.560 many times is what my friend Tom Murphy
03:06:39.840 would used to call play money I mean it
03:06:42.359 you know it's it's almost meaningless to
03:06:45.180 the person on one side of the table
03:06:46.439 whether somebody gets a hundred thousand
03:06:47.939 shares of restricted stock or a million
03:06:49.680 shares of restricted stock and it's not
03:06:51.240 meaningless to the guy on the other side
03:06:52.620 of the table almost every other
03:06:54.779 negotiation in American Business you
03:06:57.540 have some parody of concern
03:07:00.540 but you do not have a parody of concern
03:07:02.399 you know in terms of the uh in terms of
03:07:05.460 comp at the top levels you have a parody
03:07:07.740 of concern when you get down to labor
03:07:09.300 unions I mean the management wants to
03:07:10.680 keep down the prices and the union wants
03:07:12.180 to get more money and you know and and
03:07:14.240 that's a real negotiation and you have
03:07:17.760 you know I mean you have lots of other
03:07:19.260 real negotiations in American business
03:07:21.140 but the compensation in many companies
03:07:24.960 not all obviously but but in many many
03:07:27.420 companies
03:07:28.439 has not been a real negotiation at all
03:07:30.420 and the management is hired
03:07:32.279 comp Consultants to come in and I have
03:07:34.500 never seen a comp consultant come in and
03:07:36.120 say we ought to reduce this guy's salary
03:07:37.560 I've also never
03:07:38.880 seen a comp consultant come in and say
03:07:40.560 why don't you get rid of this bozo you
03:07:42.180 know I mean you know they can't all be
03:07:44.100 wonderful but uh
03:07:45.899 you know can you imagine a comp
03:07:47.760 consultant doing that never getting
03:07:49.020 another assignment it wouldn't happen so
03:07:51.300 it's it's a bad system and it needs
03:07:54.420 Improvement and it may be getting a
03:07:56.220 little Improvement and as I wrote in the
03:07:57.779 annual report this year what happens
03:07:58.920 with comp is the acid test of corporate
03:08:00.960 reform because frankly the CEOs of
03:08:03.240 America they don't care whether their
03:08:04.979 boards are diverse or not diverse or
03:08:06.840 anything of the sort they care about how
03:08:08.100 much money they make in in the great
03:08:09.720 many cases and and you the owners and
03:08:13.140 big owners in particular you know have
03:08:15.479 to provide some countervailing force or
03:08:18.600 you'll have what you've had in the last
03:08:19.920 20 years which is an enormous disparity
03:08:22.460 in the rates of compensation of people
03:08:25.020 at the top compared to people at the
03:08:26.520 bottom and also a disconnect between the
03:08:30.060 comp of people running businesses and
03:08:32.040 the results of the owners who gave them
03:08:33.479 the money
03:08:34.620 so arise you know shareholder
03:08:37.970 [Applause]
03:08:43.140 let's go to number five
03:08:47.100 the um well the answer is I do believe
03:08:49.979 in dividends and in a great many
03:08:52.319 situations including many of the ones
03:08:54.240 that companies in which we own stock
03:08:56.700 to test about whether to pay dividends
03:08:58.620 is whether you can can
03:09:02.220 continue to create more than one dollar
03:09:04.620 of value for every dollar you retain
03:09:07.260 and there are many business we take
03:09:10.920 seeds candy which we own See's Candy has
03:09:13.680 paid everything virtually out to us that
03:09:15.359 they've earned because they do not have
03:09:16.800 the ability Within These candy
03:09:19.580 to use large sums which they earn uh
03:09:23.939 intelligently in their business so it'd
03:09:26.279 be an enormous mistake for See's Candy
03:09:28.020 to retain money so they distributed
03:09:29.939 Berkshire
03:09:31.020 and we hope that we move that around in
03:09:34.500 some other area where that dollar
03:09:36.660 becomes worth a dollar ten cents or a
03:09:38.880 dollar twenty cents in terms of present
03:09:40.439 value terms if we do that
03:09:43.260 the shareholder whether they're taxable
03:09:45.960 or whether they're not taxable whether
03:09:47.640 they're a foundation or whether they're
03:09:49.800 living on income even they are better
03:09:52.200 off if if we retain the money because if
03:09:55.319 in if they were going to get a dollar in
03:09:56.880 dividends and it became worth a dollar
03:09:59.460 ten or a dollar twenty in market value
03:10:01.260 immediately on a present value basis uh
03:10:04.800 they're better off selling a small
03:10:06.359 percentage of their stock and and
03:10:08.640 realizing uh the required amount that
03:10:11.939 way and they will have more money when
03:10:13.740 they get all through doing that than if
03:10:15.600 we paid it in dividends but if the time
03:10:17.760 comes
03:10:18.960 uh and it will come someday when the if
03:10:21.960 the time comes when we don't think we
03:10:24.359 can use the money effectively to create
03:10:26.760 more than a dollar a market value per
03:10:28.380 dollar retained then it should be paid
03:10:31.140 out and like I say we do that
03:10:32.880 individually within Berkshire but
03:10:35.279 because we have this
03:10:36.779 ability to redistribute money
03:10:39.899 uh in a tax efficient way within the
03:10:43.920 company we probably had more
03:10:47.100 we had more reason to retain all of our
03:10:50.220 earnings if See's Candy were Standalone
03:10:52.080 company
03:10:53.399 we would simply pay out a lot of the the
03:10:56.220 earnings practically all of the earnings
03:10:58.020 and dividends just like we do now except
03:10:59.819 it goes to Berkshire that
03:11:02.760 we like our we like the companies in
03:11:05.160 which we have Investments
03:11:07.560 to pay to us the money they can't use
03:11:09.600 efficiently in their own business in
03:11:11.819 some cases that's a hundred percent of
03:11:13.260 what they earn in some cases is zero
03:11:15.120 percent of the year and we own some
03:11:16.200 stocks that don't pay any dividends big
03:11:18.660 opportunities in life have to be seized
03:11:21.260 uh we don't do very many things but when
03:11:23.760 we get the chance to do something that's
03:11:25.200 right and big we've got to do it
03:11:27.479 and even to do it in a small scale is
03:11:29.760 just as big a mistake almost as not
03:11:31.260 doing it at all I mean you've really
03:11:32.700 gotta you gotta grab them when they come
03:11:34.380 and because they you're not going to get
03:11:36.479 500 great opportunities you would be
03:11:39.060 better off if when you got out of school
03:11:40.560 here
03:11:41.460 you got a punch card with 20 punches on
03:11:44.340 it
03:11:45.000 and every big Financial every financial
03:11:46.979 decision you made you used up a punch
03:11:49.439 you'd get very rich because you'd think
03:11:51.479 through very hard each one I mean he
03:11:53.700 went to a cocktail party and somebody
03:11:54.779 talked about a company he didn't even
03:11:56.100 understand what they did or couldn't
03:11:57.240 pronounce the name but they made some
03:11:59.520 money last week and another one like it
03:12:01.200 you wouldn't buy it if you only had 20
03:12:03.000 punches on that card there's a
03:12:04.500 temptation to dabble if uh particularly
03:12:07.620 during bull markets uh uh in stocks it's
03:12:10.680 so easy you know it's easier now than
03:12:12.540 ever because you can do it online you
03:12:14.279 know just you click it in and maybe it
03:12:15.779 goes up a point and get excited about
03:12:17.520 that and you buy another one the next
03:12:18.660 day and so on you can't make any money
03:12:20.580 over time doing that but if you had a
03:12:22.800 punch card with only 20 punches you
03:12:25.020 weren't going to get another one the
03:12:25.979 rest of your life you would think a long
03:12:27.660 time before every investment decision
03:12:29.640 and you would make good ones and you'd
03:12:32.279 make big ones and you probably wouldn't
03:12:34.380 even use all 20 punches at the in your
03:12:36.960 lifetime but you wouldn't need to
03:12:39.000 hi I'm uh Steve casbell from Atlanta
03:12:42.779 um my question involves interest rates
03:12:44.779 when you calculate the intrinsic value
03:12:47.279 of a business and a period of low
03:12:49.680 interest rates like we have currently do
03:12:52.080 you use a higher discount rate to factor
03:12:54.359 in higher rates in the future
03:12:56.279 and also um when do you ever look at a
03:12:59.340 company's free cash flow yield relative
03:13:01.859 to current rates and if I could also get
03:13:04.200 your thoughts on the dividend tax cut if
03:13:07.560 by some miracle the politicians think
03:13:10.380 logically and get rid of the dividend
03:13:12.680 taxes would Berkshire ever pay a
03:13:15.120 dividend
03:13:16.920 the question on discount rates we
03:13:21.359 we use the same discount I mean in
03:13:24.180 theory we would use the same discount
03:13:25.680 rate across
03:13:27.660 all Securities because if you really
03:13:30.060 knew the cash they were going to produce
03:13:32.460 you know that would that would take care
03:13:34.020 of we may be more conservative in
03:13:36.300 estimating the returns of cash from some
03:13:38.399 but the the discount rate we would use
03:13:40.500 as a constant now in terms of where we
03:13:42.600 commit
03:13:44.160 you know we don't want to use the fact
03:13:46.380 that short-term rates are one and a
03:13:48.000 quarter percent to think that something
03:13:49.620 that yields us three percent or four
03:13:51.540 percent is a good deal so we sort of
03:13:53.819 have a minimum threshold in our mind
03:13:56.880 about which we're below which were
03:13:58.979 unwilling to commit money
03:14:01.560 and we're unwilling to commit it with
03:14:02.939 their interest rates are six or seven
03:14:04.439 percent or whether they're three or four
03:14:06.000 percent or whether they're on a
03:14:07.319 short-term basis one percent we just we
03:14:09.540 don't want to get hooked
03:14:11.279 into long-term Investments at low rates
03:14:13.740 just because they're a little bit better
03:14:15.540 than than short rates would be or or low
03:14:19.080 government rates would be so we
03:14:21.600 we have minimum thresholds in our mind I
03:14:24.000 can't tell you precisely what they are
03:14:25.620 but they're uh they're a whole lot
03:14:27.840 higher than present government rates
03:14:29.880 would be
03:14:31.140 and at other times we'd be very happy
03:14:32.939 owning governments just because we feel
03:14:34.680 that they offer attractive enough rates
03:14:37.200 uh uh I would
03:14:40.380 when we're looking at a business we're
03:14:42.000 looking at holding it forever and and we
03:14:45.600 want to be sure we're getting an
03:14:46.800 adequate return on Capital
03:14:49.620 we don't regard what we can get on
03:14:51.420 short-term rates now is adequate but
03:14:53.340 we'll still sit
03:14:55.939 then you know a little bit and start
03:14:58.500 settling for lower rates for 30 years
03:15:01.920 because rates for 30 days or so low we
03:15:04.620 would rather just sit it out and wait a
03:15:07.020 while
03:15:08.460 um the tax on dividends
03:15:10.500 uh
03:15:11.880 you know I've used this illustration
03:15:13.319 before but I'm paying about the same
03:15:15.600 percentage
03:15:16.920 of my income to the federal government
03:15:19.920 as my secretary does now I pay more
03:15:23.460 in income tax rates than she does I pay
03:15:26.220 a higher marginal tax rate by some
03:15:28.200 margin than she does but she pays way
03:15:29.819 more in Social Security taxes than I do
03:15:31.859 because I only pay out the first
03:15:33.660 whatever it is 70 or 80 000 of income
03:15:35.880 and so she's paying
03:15:38.460 between what we pay at the company for
03:15:40.740 and what she pays who are paying 12 or
03:15:43.200 13 percent or whatever it is of that so
03:15:46.140 we both end up paying fairly similar
03:15:48.740 percentages of our income to the federal
03:15:51.720 government every year
03:15:53.640 if Berkshire were to declare a billion
03:15:55.920 dollar dividend and my share of it was
03:15:57.779 330 million and it were tax-free
03:16:01.560 as
03:16:03.479 the bush people originally suggested and
03:16:05.700 it would be tax-free I mean we have lots
03:16:07.680 of taxable earnings at Berkshire you
03:16:10.260 know I might be paying
03:16:12.120 one tenth of the rate to the federal
03:16:14.819 government of my income that she would
03:16:16.740 be now I can make the
03:16:18.600 argument about
03:16:21.060 the fact that structure shouldn't govern
03:16:22.920 tax rates that that sub chapter S and
03:16:26.279 sub chapters and chapter C and
03:16:28.319 Partnerships and all of these things
03:16:29.760 that the tax code should be neutral
03:16:31.319 between them and I've made those kind of
03:16:33.120 arguments in the past
03:16:34.859 but I can make no argument in my mind
03:16:37.080 that says that I with everything that
03:16:40.020 you know all the luck I've had in life
03:16:41.760 you know I was wired a certain way at
03:16:43.500 Birth that enabled me to make a lot of
03:16:45.300 money and frankly it was better to be
03:16:46.620 born a boy than a a girl in terms of
03:16:48.960 money making possibilities in 1930 and
03:16:51.240 probably still is but not to the same
03:16:52.920 degree I mean the fact that
03:16:55.319 that I would send one-tenth
03:16:58.380 portion of my income in the year to the
03:17:00.540 federal government that my secretary
03:17:02.700 would I it just it screams at Injustice
03:17:06.000 to me in terms of what the society gives
03:17:08.220 back to me
03:17:09.600 so I'm not I am not for the I'm not for
03:17:11.700 the bush plan at them Charlie
03:17:15.600 well I I agree with you even if you
03:17:17.939 assume that the whole economy would work
03:17:20.819 better if we'd never gotten into this
03:17:23.279 double taxation system on corporate
03:17:25.620 earnings which I don't think is a clear
03:17:27.660 thing anyway but even if you even if you
03:17:29.700 assume that
03:17:30.960 I think even you live in a democracy
03:17:33.120 where there's lots of
03:17:34.740 envy and resentment and what have you
03:17:37.800 to have the absolute most fortunate
03:17:40.140 people
03:17:41.399 paying practically no income taxes
03:17:44.399 I I just think it's unacceptable
03:17:47.520 I think there has to be some
03:17:50.399 fairness in in uh in some of these
03:17:54.180 Arrangements
03:17:55.380 uh
03:17:58.740 even if there's some theoretical
03:18:00.660 argument that the economy might work a
03:18:03.540 little better some other way
03:18:06.420 yeah there are IRAs now obviously that
03:18:09.060 work very well for people with modest
03:18:11.340 amounts of dividends that they they're
03:18:13.020 getting tax deferred for a very long
03:18:15.300 period of time which has huge benefits
03:18:17.160 the big benefits
03:18:19.560 of exempting dividends would go to
03:18:21.960 fellows like me and Charlie you know and
03:18:23.760 that's not going to stimulate the
03:18:24.899 economy it's going to stimulate us but
03:18:27.120 uh
03:18:28.319 and it's going to result in US
03:18:31.800 sending a very small percentage
03:18:35.100 of the income of our income
03:18:38.040 to Washington compared to what the
03:18:41.160 people you know working in our shoe
03:18:43.140 factories send and uh
03:18:45.240 that you know when somebody says you
03:18:47.760 know what did you do during the war
03:18:48.960 Grandpa I'm not sure that's what I want
03:18:50.399 to explain to them
03:18:52.260 number three
03:18:54.779 hi my name is Charlie rice and I'm a
03:18:57.120 stockholder from St Louis Missouri
03:18:59.939 appreciate hearing your comments on
03:19:02.220 publicly held companies using their cash
03:19:05.160 for uh dividends versus stock BuyBacks
03:19:10.439 well we the equation is pretty simple
03:19:13.020 but the practice doesn't necessarily
03:19:15.540 follow logic
03:19:17.160 the
03:19:19.439 it's obviously as long as you're telling
03:19:21.720 the truth your shareholders about what's
03:19:23.160 going on so that you aren't manipulating
03:19:24.899 the stock downward or something
03:19:27.120 when a stock can be bought well below
03:19:29.399 its business value
03:19:31.140 uh that probably is the best use of cash
03:19:34.200 it's something the Washington posted on
03:19:36.120 a huge scale
03:19:37.620 back in the 1970s Teledyne may have
03:19:40.620 bought 90 or something or close to it of
03:19:42.840 their stock back and that was the reason
03:19:45.500 a very significant percentage of
03:19:47.640 companies bought stock back in the past
03:19:49.140 because they actually thought it was
03:19:50.279 selling for less than it was worth
03:19:52.319 uh like I say that that can be abused if
03:19:55.620 you do various things to bury your stock
03:19:57.540 in one way or another but but that
03:19:59.580 wasn't the usual case
03:20:01.700 it stock repurchases were relatively
03:20:04.680 unpopular in those days they become
03:20:07.200 quite popular now and and and to the
03:20:09.720 extent that I've been around a good
03:20:10.979 number of them and
03:20:12.420 and been able to pick up on what I
03:20:14.399 thought was the underlying rationale if
03:20:16.500 not the professed rationale
03:20:19.080 you know I think it's often done for
03:20:21.180 people that that are hoping that it
03:20:23.760 causes their
03:20:25.020 their stock price not to go down and uh
03:20:27.720 and they're you know and often done at
03:20:30.120 prices that don't really make a lot of
03:20:31.620 sense for continuing shareholders
03:20:34.200 um if we wanted to
03:20:36.720 return a bunch of
03:20:38.580 cash to shareholders we would if our
03:20:41.160 stock was undervalued we would we would
03:20:44.100 we would go to the shareholders and say
03:20:46.500 we think it's cheap and and we think
03:20:48.600 that this cash can be better used by you
03:20:50.700 than by us and we will therefore have be
03:20:54.240 repurchasing at what we think is a
03:20:56.520 discount intrinsic value and the people
03:20:58.200 that remain will be better off and the
03:21:00.240 people to get out will get out at a
03:21:01.680 little bit better price than they would
03:21:02.819 otherwise
03:21:04.500 um
03:21:05.160 in terms of dividends you get into an
03:21:07.920 expectational situation
03:21:10.260 and for most companies
03:21:12.240 that follow a that pay a cash dividend
03:21:15.779 it doesn't make sense to be
03:21:17.760 to bounce around the dividend from year
03:21:19.560 to year although private companies
03:21:21.660 frequently do that
03:21:23.760 and we do it ourselves with our
03:21:25.319 subsidiaries they have some some
03:21:26.640 subsidiary can pay us a lot of money one
03:21:28.620 year and not so much money the next year
03:21:30.680 but with public companies
03:21:34.500 people do a lot of people do buy stocks
03:21:37.260 to obtain dividends and they hope for
03:21:39.420 regularity and if there's a signaling
03:21:41.160 aspect to it and everything so
03:21:43.920 I would I would say that once you
03:21:46.260 establish a dividend policy with a
03:21:48.359 public company you should think a long
03:21:50.340 time before you change that policy in a
03:21:53.520 material way
03:21:54.840 but I think the best use of cash if you
03:21:57.420 don't have a good use for it in the
03:21:58.620 business if the stock is underpriced as
03:22:01.140 to repurchase it and if it's over a
03:22:02.700 price you've got no business buying in a
03:22:04.140 single share but a lot of companies do
03:22:06.600 it Charlie
03:22:12.060 yeah the Dividends are a very
03:22:14.220 interesting subject
03:22:15.840 if you count the unnecessary stock
03:22:18.060 trading and the cost of investment
03:22:19.979 advice and the cost of making a lot of
03:22:22.800 errors in the trading costs in and out
03:22:25.920 I don't think would be too extreme to
03:22:27.779 say that now
03:22:30.240 the total amount that's paid out in
03:22:31.920 dividends is roughly equal to the amount
03:22:34.380 that is wasted in illustrating and
03:22:36.779 investment advice
03:22:38.580 so that
03:22:40.439 the net dividends that come to the
03:22:42.479 shareholders are approximately zero this
03:22:44.880 is a very peculiar way to run a republic
03:22:47.580 and
03:22:49.560 very few people comment about it yeah
03:22:52.080 actually I did in an article some time
03:22:54.720 ago and Fortune the frictional costs
03:22:58.680 to American shareholders in sort of
03:23:00.779 changing chairs
03:23:04.319 for All American businesses to hold
03:23:06.060 those frictional costs are probably not
03:23:08.220 much different than the entire amount
03:23:09.600 paid out by American corporations so but
03:23:14.220 getting to the individual Corporation
03:23:16.140 level a company that expects to
03:23:18.600 regularly earn more than it than it can
03:23:21.840 profitably employ in its business should
03:23:24.359 be paying out dividends take a
03:23:26.460 subsidiary of ours like See's Candy we
03:23:28.620 would love to expand C's candy to double
03:23:30.960 or triple its present size but it
03:23:32.700 doesn't work we've tried it a lot of
03:23:34.200 different ways so it should be paying
03:23:35.939 out attorneys if it was a public company
03:23:38.520 and it was at one time you know you
03:23:40.979 could argue that something approaching a
03:23:43.140 100 payout would would make sense there
03:23:45.540 but most Management's worrying about
03:23:48.540 earnings falling off at some time in the
03:23:50.279 future would rather establish a lower
03:23:52.200 level and and and and and and therefore
03:23:55.399 ensure regularity of dividends uh by by
03:23:59.520 going with it with a conservative level
03:24:01.500 uh
03:24:03.840 I
03:24:05.279 you know we it's obviously something we
03:24:07.800 think about at Berkshire when we have 30
03:24:10.200 odd billion dollars around if we can't
03:24:11.880 figure out a way to employ that over
03:24:13.560 time you know it's it's a mistake to
03:24:16.020 keep it in corporate form but
03:24:19.020 we have this expectation and I think
03:24:21.120 it's a reasonable expectation that we
03:24:23.100 get the put it to work if we ever came
03:24:25.439 to the different conclusion
03:24:27.600 if our stock we thought our stock was
03:24:29.939 significantly undervalued we'd probably
03:24:31.680 figure in terms of dispersing it through
03:24:34.380 repurchases particularly where now
03:24:36.779 dividends and capital gains are are
03:24:39.239 neutral for for individuals uh
03:24:43.080 and
03:24:45.200 if our stock was not underpriced and we
03:24:47.939 felt we would we would probably do
03:24:49.500 something by a dividend
03:24:53.160 it's not going to happen soon however
03:24:59.340 good afternoon Mr Buffett Mr Munger my
03:25:02.340 name is Mark stender from San Francisco
03:25:06.060 um my question involves
03:25:08.279 if you live in California which I
03:25:10.319 understand you do sometime of the year
03:25:12.540 it's almost mandatory that you shop at
03:25:14.460 Whole Foods Markets
03:25:17.000 they sell a lot of organic food there
03:25:19.560 and I was wondering if anyone ever tried
03:25:21.779 to feed you organic food or
03:25:24.680 organic food stock
03:25:27.359 I've never been near the place but um
03:25:31.439 Charlie
03:25:33.800 well I've never thought it was a health
03:25:35.819 nut but he may have some comment to make
03:25:38.700 on this being a Californian
03:25:42.239 no my idea of a good place to shop is
03:25:44.700 Costco
03:25:49.859 has these heavily marbled filet steaks
03:25:54.180 in the finest grade and
03:25:57.500 the idea of eating a little whole grain
03:26:00.899 whatever I'm washing it down with some
03:26:03.120 carrot juice is just never appeal to me
03:26:09.300 we don't have a lot of arguments between
03:26:10.979 the two of us about where to eat
03:26:13.979 number nine
03:26:15.800 hello thank you I'm Sherman Silber from
03:26:19.200 St Louis I'm a fertility doctor in St
03:26:21.720 Louis we kind of view ourselves as the
03:26:24.479 Berkshire Hathaway of infertility
03:26:26.460 treatment we don't know anything really
03:26:29.040 about business we're doctors and
03:26:30.720 scientists and so first I'd just like to
03:26:33.060 say I really appreciate you the people
03:26:35.819 that you have on your board and would
03:26:37.800 like to keep it that way because we do
03:26:39.779 know a lot about character and I'm happy
03:26:41.819 to have our savings safe with you and
03:26:46.020 the people of character that represent
03:26:48.720 the company
03:26:56.160 I just had an opportunity a couple of
03:26:58.140 weeks ago I was talking to
03:27:00.260 one of the former managers of the
03:27:03.200 Fidelity Magellan fund manage huge
03:27:06.660 amounts of money and he he never really
03:27:08.340 met you and I was saying I may have a
03:27:09.899 chance to ask Warren Buffett and Charlie
03:27:12.720 Munger a question what would that
03:27:14.399 question be I wanted to have some idea
03:27:16.859 of something intelligent I could ask
03:27:19.140 business-wise and he thought if he had
03:27:22.020 the opportunity to talk to you the best
03:27:24.120 thing is to give you what would sound
03:27:25.620 like a softball question because
03:27:28.680 um because you could maybe bring more
03:27:30.779 profoundness to this than we hear
03:27:32.520 usually
03:27:33.779 what in view of the Iraq War uh Consumer
03:27:38.279 Debt that's increasing declining job
03:27:41.399 growth
03:27:42.500 declining pay in the jobs that are
03:27:45.120 growing prospects of increased interest
03:27:48.000 rates
03:27:49.580 he has this view that the next five to
03:27:52.380 ten years are going to be very difficult
03:27:53.960 what would your view be about this the
03:27:57.120 investment future for the next five to
03:27:59.460 ten years in view of all these negative
03:28:02.220 factors going on
03:28:05.680 [Laughter]
03:28:09.960 well I would say that at any given point
03:28:12.300 in history including when stocks were
03:28:14.640 their cheapest you could find
03:28:18.300 um an equally impressive number of
03:28:21.239 negative factors I mean you can you
03:28:24.300 could have sat down in 1974 when stocks
03:28:27.060 were screaming Bargains and you could
03:28:29.640 have written down all kinds of things
03:28:31.739 that would would have caused you to say
03:28:34.680 you know the future is just going to be
03:28:36.420 terrible
03:28:37.380 and similarly it at the top you know or
03:28:41.220 anytime you can write down a large list
03:28:43.439 of of things that would be quite on the
03:28:47.640 bullish side we don't panic we really
03:28:49.680 don't pay any attention to that sort of
03:28:51.420 thing I mean we we have
03:28:53.340 uh you might say that our underlying
03:28:55.620 premise
03:28:56.819 and I think it's a pretty sound
03:28:58.319 underlying premise is that this country
03:29:00.720 will do very well
03:29:04.620 um and and in particular it will do well
03:29:07.020 for business businesses done very well
03:29:08.700 you know the Dow went from 66 to
03:29:12.120 ten thousand plus in the Hundred Years
03:29:14.700 of the 20th century and we had two world
03:29:17.700 wars and nuclear bombs and flu epidemics
03:29:21.420 and we you know you name it cold war
03:29:24.239 there's always they're always there's
03:29:26.760 always problems in the future there are
03:29:28.380 always opportunities in the future and
03:29:29.939 in this country the opportunities have
03:29:32.220 won out over the problems over time and
03:29:34.140 I think
03:29:35.100 they will continue to do so absent
03:29:37.800 the weapons of mass destruction which is
03:29:40.020 another question and business won't make
03:29:42.779 much difference if anything really
03:29:44.760 drastic happens along that line so
03:29:48.060 we don't
03:29:49.439 I don't I can't remember
03:29:51.660 any discussions Charlie that I have had
03:29:54.779 ever going back to 1959
03:29:57.680 that where we would have come to the
03:30:00.600 conclusion at the end of them that we
03:30:02.880 would have passed on a great business
03:30:04.260 opportunity a business to buy because of
03:30:08.100 external conditions nor did we ever buy
03:30:10.920 anything we thought was
03:30:12.420 uh mediocre simply because we thought
03:30:15.300 the world was going to be wonderful at
03:30:17.399 the uh it won't be the American economy
03:30:20.580 in my view the Dozen investors over a 5
03:30:24.239 or 10 or 20 year period it will be the
03:30:26.460 investors themselves uh if you look at
03:30:29.340 the record of the 20th century you'd say
03:30:30.720 how could anybody have missed you know
03:30:32.939 and owning equities during that time and
03:30:35.040 yet you know we had
03:30:36.479 we had all kinds of people wiped out you
03:30:39.180 know in the 2932 period we had we had
03:30:42.840 all kinds of things that were bad but if
03:30:45.720 if you would just own stocks right
03:30:48.180 straight through didn't leverage them
03:30:50.160 you know you would you have gotten a
03:30:52.260 perfectly decent return so we're
03:30:55.200 were unaffected
03:30:57.120 in essence by the
03:30:59.520 by the variables you mentioned just show
03:31:02.160 us a good business tomorrow and we'll
03:31:03.540 jump at the hook Charlie
03:31:06.120 yeah I think but it's also true that
03:31:08.040 both of us have sat at various times
03:31:10.140 over the last three years that we
03:31:12.540 wouldn't be at all surprised if
03:31:15.300 professionally invested
03:31:17.399 money in America had a pretty modest
03:31:20.160 result over a fairly extended period of
03:31:22.620 the future compared to the very
03:31:24.359 dramatically High returns that it had
03:31:27.840 achieved
03:31:29.399 up to about three years ago
03:31:31.979 and so far that's been proved out to be
03:31:35.760 pretty much right certain stretches are
03:31:38.700 easier than other stretches yeah our
03:31:41.160 expectations were
03:31:43.439 were more modest than most people's a
03:31:45.720 few years ago we didn't say the world
03:31:47.100 was coming to an end or anything we just
03:31:48.660 said that people have gone crazy in
03:31:50.100 certain sectors and that and that
03:31:52.080 anybody that thought that
03:31:53.700 that you could you know sit at home and
03:31:56.340 day trade and make double-digit returns
03:31:58.680 over time or do anything that you were
03:32:01.260 entitled to that you know by just
03:32:03.420 sticking a little money in your 401k or
03:32:05.399 something was really living in a Fool's
03:32:08.520 Paradise
03:32:09.779 but that was never accompanied by any
03:32:13.739 predictions of disaster for the American
03:32:16.260 economy as a whole or for American
03:32:17.819 Business as a whole
03:32:19.319 uh
03:32:21.120 it's people get crazy Notions from time
03:32:23.939 to time in financial markets you know
03:32:25.680 with coming on this earlier but they
03:32:27.960 just believe things that there's
03:32:29.939 it's hard to understand how they can
03:32:31.500 believe now since some extent they get
03:32:33.000 sold up by other people
03:32:35.580 but uh
03:32:37.279 uh American Business
03:32:40.080 really is has never let investors Down
03:32:43.979 Under the group but investors have done
03:32:45.540 themselves and quite frequently
03:32:50.279 Lauren and Charlie my name is Peter
03:32:52.500 brochie from Beverly Massachusetts and I
03:32:54.899 would like to thank you both for helping
03:32:56.460 me become a better businessman and a
03:32:58.500 better investor
03:32:59.939 perhaps more importantly you have
03:33:01.560 created by example a kind of True North
03:33:03.840 on the moral compass for me to steer by
03:33:06.899 while the education has been fantastic I
03:33:09.840 have found that the demands of owning a
03:33:11.460 successful business and having a large
03:33:13.560 family do not leave time to apply the
03:33:16.500 research stance I have become so
03:33:19.080 wonderfully accustomed to by being a
03:33:20.819 member of this cult
03:33:22.380 please imagine for a moment that you are
03:33:24.540 30 years younger and have only a few
03:33:27.000 holes left in your investment punch card
03:33:30.060 if you were in my situation to the
03:33:32.460 extent that you would diversify your
03:33:34.200 Holdings Beyond Berkshire Hathaway
03:33:37.020 given this environment how would you
03:33:39.359 choose the investment managers or as
03:33:42.180 Charlie has just discussed when
03:33:44.460 addressing foundations would you hunt
03:33:46.920 for two more great companies to invest
03:33:49.500 in Via Common Stocks
03:33:52.020 Charlie why don't you take a swing of
03:33:53.640 that
03:33:54.600 well of course you're hunting that's
03:33:57.600 part of the fun of life
03:33:59.279 and uh but I would say they the chief
03:34:03.540 lesson would be that
03:34:05.819 you're unlikely to find very many in a
03:34:07.979 whole lifetime
03:34:09.300 and when you find one in which you
03:34:11.580 really have thought it out and have
03:34:13.439 confidence for God's sakes don't do it
03:34:15.420 in a niggardly fashion the idea that
03:34:18.300 very smart people with investment skills
03:34:20.580 should have hugely Diversified
03:34:22.319 portfolios
03:34:23.939 is madness it's a very conventional
03:34:26.939 Madness and it's taught in all the
03:34:29.100 Business Schools but they're wrong
03:34:37.979 the question of
03:34:39.960 finding other advisors is a tough one I
03:34:42.720 mean when I wound up my partnership
03:34:45.840 in 19 the end of 1969 and I had all
03:34:49.920 these partners that had counted on me
03:34:52.020 and I was going to mail them back a lot
03:34:53.580 of money
03:34:55.140 um you know I felt an obligation
03:34:57.960 to at least suggest some alternatives
03:35:00.660 for them
03:35:01.800 and i s i recommended
03:35:04.560 two people
03:35:06.479 who I knew were exceptionally good and
03:35:08.899 exceptionally honest
03:35:10.979 uh we put one of them on the board not
03:35:14.220 long ago and reaffirmed it today uh
03:35:16.680 Sandy gottisman the other one was Bill
03:35:18.239 ruane
03:35:19.560 now I've been around the investment
03:35:21.660 world for a long time at that point
03:35:24.720 and those were the two I knew but they
03:35:26.520 were more or less contemporaries of mine
03:35:28.200 and I'd gotten to gnome over the years
03:35:30.060 and I'd seen them for a long time so I
03:35:32.220 not only knew their results but I knew
03:35:33.720 how they'd accomplish their results
03:35:34.920 which is terribly important
03:35:36.960 uh
03:35:38.160 I don't know that generation of managers
03:35:41.399 now but the fact that with the number of
03:35:45.720 people I knew that I could only come up
03:35:47.939 with two at a time when I was very
03:35:50.100 active
03:35:51.319 says something about the difficulties of
03:35:54.239 of finding managers the one thing
03:35:57.540 I can almost guarantee to you is that
03:35:59.880 the promotional types going around to
03:36:02.340 solicit the institutional investors are
03:36:04.920 very unlikely
03:36:06.840 to meet any long-term tests of
03:36:09.899 of ability and sometimes integrity
03:36:13.140 it's not an easy
03:36:15.120 job spotting an investor I think it's
03:36:17.880 probably easier depending on the amount
03:36:19.260 of time you know you mentioned having
03:36:20.819 children in the business and the amount
03:36:22.080 of time you can spend on every now and
03:36:23.819 then you do if you if you're
03:36:25.920 if you're conscious of
03:36:28.080 the investment world and you have
03:36:30.600 some kind of sort of grounding knowledge
03:36:32.700 about what's going on you can see
03:36:34.439 something
03:36:35.640 you know as we did in junk bonds a
03:36:38.100 couple of years ago or as we did with
03:36:39.720 all kinds of things some years back when
03:36:42.300 stocks were cheaper you you will
03:36:44.399 occasionally say something that that you
03:36:46.620 should load up on and and Charlie says
03:36:49.080 that's what you really have to do I mean
03:36:50.760 some of the people in this room
03:36:52.439 loaded up on Berkshire many years ago
03:36:57.180 and the truth was they didn't need
03:36:58.500 diversification you know I loaded up on
03:37:00.660 it that uh Charlie did and you'll see
03:37:04.080 opportunities
03:37:05.640 occasionally but you're not going to see
03:37:07.560 them every day or every week if you if
03:37:08.939 you think you're going to see an
03:37:09.840 opportunity every week you're going to
03:37:11.520 lose a lot of money
03:37:13.220 because people will come around and tell
03:37:15.300 you that they've got them and they may
03:37:16.560 not be quite as flagrant as that fellow
03:37:18.180 we had in the movie but they're a
03:37:20.819 version of that
03:37:22.260 Charlie yeah
03:37:24.239 the business of selecting investment
03:37:26.520 managers
03:37:29.700 was recently shown to be even harder
03:37:31.920 than
03:37:32.819 than I had previously thought it was a
03:37:35.640 significant fraction of the
03:37:37.920 institutional investment managers who
03:37:40.380 run the nation's mutual funds
03:37:44.399 actually accepted propositions to take
03:37:48.000 bribes
03:37:49.140 for betraying their own shareholders it
03:37:53.640 was as if
03:37:55.020 a man came to you and said I have a
03:37:58.020 wonderful proposition
03:38:00.060 why don't I kill your mother and we'll
03:38:02.279 split the insurance money
03:38:04.620 and it was that ridiculous and yet a
03:38:07.920 significant number of the people said
03:38:09.960 Gee I would like some insurance money
03:38:12.420 and they just went right ahead and they
03:38:14.640 were already rich beforehand yes the the
03:38:17.180 Absol and they've destroyed themselves
03:38:19.380 many of them by making this insane
03:38:22.080 decision
03:38:23.100 and and I think many of them are
03:38:25.439 probably think the outcome is unjust
03:38:27.779 and I mean the the downfall they've had
03:38:30.239 and the interesting thing about it of
03:38:32.160 course is that here is a huge industry
03:38:34.739 that
03:38:36.060 where the people who weren't doing it
03:38:38.220 have a great interest in having that
03:38:40.080 reputation of the industry not get
03:38:41.819 stained
03:38:43.080 and a number of them had to know what
03:38:45.180 was going on I mean this would I don't I
03:38:47.580 I it's hard for me to imagine that
03:38:50.279 people at most large mutual funds even
03:38:52.800 the ones that didn't their mutual fund
03:38:54.779 management companies even the ones that
03:38:56.160 weren't engaging in the activities
03:38:59.100 mentioned
03:39:00.300 uh weren't aware of it I mean you just
03:39:02.640 if you're in an industry like that
03:39:04.140 you're going to hear what's going on and
03:39:06.540 the Investment Company Institute was
03:39:08.340 busy patting itself on the back you know
03:39:10.439 one meeting and after another and and
03:39:12.120 becoming very cozy with legislators and
03:39:16.140 there wasn't one thing done until
03:39:19.680 a whistleblower went to Elliot Spitzer
03:39:21.899 and uh uh and he got active
03:39:26.460 in the very strong way with a very
03:39:28.260 limited staff
03:39:29.760 and he uncovered
03:39:32.100 and put on the front pages
03:39:34.739 what was taking place but the industry
03:39:36.840 itself
03:39:38.340 with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
03:39:41.220 of people that must have known what was
03:39:42.600 going on
03:39:43.920 uh and it went on for a long time
03:39:46.739 never said a word it's it's a
03:39:49.859 you know it makes you wonder a little
03:39:51.479 bit
03:39:53.399 number three
03:39:57.420 number three
03:40:00.840 Dear Mr Buffett Dear Mr manga My Name is
03:40:03.960 Oliver crouchite from Frankfurt in
03:40:05.939 Germany
03:40:07.319 the subprime crisis has led to
03:40:09.420 inconsistent pricing in capital markets
03:40:12.600 credits are trading at large discounts
03:40:14.939 and at the same time the equities do not
03:40:18.120 respect do not reflect this
03:40:20.520 my question is when will this be over
03:40:23.340 and how do you take advantage of Market
03:40:25.859 dislocations
03:40:29.640 well when there are Market dislocations
03:40:31.439 there are always ways to take advantage
03:40:32.880 of it but we'll
03:40:34.500 we'll leave you the joy of searching for
03:40:37.140 those the
03:40:38.939 but there have been some really
03:40:40.920 important dislocations and I brought
03:40:43.439 along just for your amusement uh
03:40:46.500 a few figures on something that
03:40:49.080 that we've done recently but it doesn't
03:40:52.500 have any big significance for Berkshire
03:40:54.540 I mean Berkshire will make some extra
03:40:56.160 money out of this it doesn't take any
03:40:58.380 time to think about but it does
03:41:00.239 illustrate just how dramatic the changes
03:41:04.200 were and the ones I brought along relate
03:41:07.260 to the
03:41:08.340 the
03:41:09.020 tax-exempt money market funds
03:41:12.420 uh there were 330 billion of these
03:41:15.060 that's a lot of money 330 billion and
03:41:17.939 they relied on repricing
03:41:20.520 a really almost all cases first grade
03:41:24.120 municipal bonds every seven days they
03:41:26.700 had these auctions and it was all set up
03:41:28.920 very elaborately so that people could
03:41:31.080 have
03:41:31.920 their money more or less in their minds
03:41:34.380 instantly available and something that
03:41:35.939 was tax exempt and they were marketed
03:41:38.100 extensively
03:41:39.420 and
03:41:40.739 I brought along for example here's one
03:41:42.600 that related to the
03:41:45.060 they were backed by various Municipal
03:41:46.979 issues this happens to be one by the L.A
03:41:48.720 County Museum of Art just pull that out
03:41:51.180 and on
03:41:52.739 January 24th
03:41:54.899 uh it was marketed at 3.15 percent
03:41:58.500 January 31st 4.0 February 7th 3.5
03:42:03.660 February 14th eight percent now how can
03:42:06.479 a tax-exempt bond of short-term nature
03:42:10.739 be selling at a three and a half percent
03:42:12.300 rate one week and one week later on
03:42:14.760 Valentine's Day be it eight percent and
03:42:17.399 one week after that be at 10 percent
03:42:19.920 it's now back to 4.2 percent now those
03:42:22.439 are in huge dislocations in markets
03:42:24.840 that's crazy it'd be one thing to be
03:42:26.819 some little obscure item but this
03:42:28.200 happened with billions and billions and
03:42:30.600 billions of dollars of Securities it
03:42:32.939 even happened
03:42:34.260 we got these bid sheets every day
03:42:36.720 and this happens to be a bid sheet I
03:42:39.359 think from Citigroup and they were
03:42:42.000 repricing these every seven days
03:42:44.700 and what you would find on these are
03:42:47.700 you'll see there's lots of issues
03:42:49.200 involved
03:42:50.520 the same issue would appear on several
03:42:53.460 different pages because it would
03:42:54.779 represent some different auction
03:42:56.720 although handled by the same broker at
03:42:59.580 the same time
03:43:01.140 on one page
03:43:03.000 you would find an issue we would bid all
03:43:06.180 these we have to bid these at 11.3
03:43:08.100 percent
03:43:09.180 on one page we bought them at eleven
03:43:11.160 three percent
03:43:12.479 on another page the same issue we bid
03:43:15.420 the 11.3 percent and somebody else bid
03:43:17.760 six percent so you had the same issue
03:43:20.100 with the same broker at the same time
03:43:22.500 being sold at 11.3 percent and six
03:43:25.319 percent those remarks of extreme
03:43:27.479 dislocation and you find those
03:43:29.640 occasionally you found that after the
03:43:31.739 long-term Capital Management crisis in
03:43:33.779 1998 you found the equivalent of it in
03:43:36.840 the stock market in 1974 and so on and
03:43:40.140 those are great times to make unusual
03:43:42.479 amounts of money and if you
03:43:44.520 there's certain things we can't figure
03:43:46.319 out I see in the Wall Street Journal I
03:43:48.180 see advertisements these days of
03:43:50.220 auctions taking place
03:43:51.899 in some esoteric mortgage Securities if
03:43:54.899 you had enough time you could probably
03:43:57.180 figure out some of those who were very
03:43:59.399 mispriced we don't fool around with that
03:44:01.260 that we just don't have the time we were
03:44:03.660 able to do four we have about four
03:44:05.700 billion in this right now when we got
03:44:07.859 all through we'll have made some extra
03:44:09.239 money for a couple of months it won't be
03:44:11.340 significant in relation to Berkshire
03:44:12.840 size but but it's something that's very
03:44:15.300 easy to do you may be able to find by
03:44:18.000 working very very hard
03:44:20.220 on some smaller issues you might be able
03:44:22.920 to find in this
03:44:24.899 mess in mortgages and it's gone beyond
03:44:27.060 subprime it's gone into all days and
03:44:29.100 it's gone into option arms and that sort
03:44:31.319 of thing you may there very well could
03:44:33.239 be some great opportunities out there
03:44:34.800 that Charlie and I will no longer spot
03:44:37.200 because we just can't be looking at that
03:44:39.899 many things Charlie
03:44:42.060 yeah what is interesting is that
03:44:47.100 how brief
03:44:49.200 these opportunities to take advantage of
03:44:52.260 this locations frequently are
03:44:54.840 some idiot hedge fund bought unlimited
03:44:57.420 municipal bonds that
03:44:59.460 you know incredible margins I think they
03:45:02.460 bought 20 times more Minnesota bonds
03:45:04.319 than they could afford with their own
03:45:06.060 money borrowing all the rest of them
03:45:08.100 those things were dumped on margin calls
03:45:11.580 municipal bonds suddenly got
03:45:14.520 mispriced in America but to this
03:45:17.040 location
03:45:19.080 was very brief
03:45:21.540 so you but very extreme you've been very
03:45:24.420 extreme and so if you can't think fast
03:45:26.340 and act resolutely it does you no good
03:45:29.180 so you're like a man standing by a
03:45:32.340 stream trying to spear a fish and the
03:45:34.200 fish just comes by once a week or once a
03:45:36.300 month or once every 10 years
03:45:38.580 and you've got to be there to throw that
03:45:40.979 spear fast before the fish swims on
03:45:44.220 it's a pretty demanding business if you
03:45:46.319 do it right
03:45:48.840 but there have been times I mean the in
03:45:50.580 the junk Mark mon Market there was a
03:45:53.160 three or four month period in 19 in 2002
03:45:56.939 with some really incredible things
03:45:58.380 happen and they happened on a large
03:45:59.819 scale so that um uh yeah it happens
03:46:02.939 about twice a century
03:46:06.779 which means that he and I have only had
03:46:08.939 four or five times when we could do it
03:46:11.660 my question is is you know how do you
03:46:14.520 what are the mental tricks you have or
03:46:16.319 how do you overcome these behavioral and
03:46:18.660 emotional traps like anchoring and what
03:46:21.239 advice do you have for us well that's a
03:46:23.340 good question and of course it first
03:46:26.580 in recognition of the fact that they can
03:46:28.920 be traps and that you and that you will
03:46:31.319 be affected by them and you will make
03:46:33.600 some mistakes because of them but uh
03:46:37.739 Charlie and his in poor Charlie's
03:46:40.500 Almanac which I probably do take credit
03:46:43.620 for the name of and uh the uh
03:46:46.979 he talks about
03:46:48.720 the various
03:46:50.160 psychological traps that people fall
03:46:52.680 into and and
03:46:55.020 simply reading that section you will
03:46:57.779 come away wiser than than before you
03:47:01.080 started on it
03:47:03.620 we will
03:47:07.140 our personalities are such that Charlie
03:47:09.899 and I probably are a little less prone
03:47:12.120 to some of those mistakes
03:47:13.859 than other people are but as our record
03:47:16.020 clearly indicates we still are prone to
03:47:18.120 them and we we make them and we'll make
03:47:20.279 them again
03:47:21.479 we're probably a little less inclined to
03:47:23.460 make some of them than we were
03:47:25.620 30 or 40 years ago but uh you know the
03:47:30.120 nice thing about it is though is that if
03:47:31.859 you make fewer of those mistakes than
03:47:33.420 others you know they will continue
03:47:35.160 making their share and you'll get very
03:47:36.840 rich Charlie
03:47:38.880 yeah you don't have to have perfect
03:47:40.620 wisdom to get very rich
03:47:42.540 all you've got to do is have slightly
03:47:44.640 more than other people on average over a
03:47:46.859 long time
03:47:52.439 it's the old story about the guy out
03:47:55.080 running the bear I mean they don't have
03:47:56.700 to outrun the bear I just have to outrun
03:47:58.140 that other fellow and
03:48:03.060 number five
03:48:06.960 I think what has happened that
03:48:09.720 at Berkshire is just wonderfully for the
03:48:12.359 good
03:48:13.140 and I do think we have a perfectly
03:48:16.140 marvelous board
03:48:17.700 what makes me sad as I said earlier is I
03:48:20.340 don't see more of the same
03:48:22.020 practice followed elsewhere a director
03:48:24.960 getting a hundred and fifty thousand
03:48:26.580 dollars a year from a company who needs
03:48:29.040 it is not an independent director
03:48:32.279 that director it automatically becomes
03:48:35.340 an inside director
03:48:36.960 and so it's a typical government
03:48:38.760 intervention
03:48:40.500 ah
03:48:41.700 it's just it says it's doing one thing
03:48:44.279 and it does another yeah I have never
03:48:46.380 I've been on 19 boards I've never seen a
03:48:48.899 director where the director's fees were
03:48:50.580 important to them
03:48:52.500 object to an acquisition proposal
03:48:56.220 object to a compensation arrangement
03:48:59.520 of the CEO it's just never happened
03:49:03.840 you know and uh in my in my experience
03:49:06.359 and and uh you know they do not
03:49:09.540 they frequently
03:49:11.160 do not behave as they would if they own
03:49:13.920 the place and and basically we want
03:49:16.260 people that that the behaviors if they
03:49:18.779 own the place the correct system is the
03:49:21.000 Lu root system
03:49:23.279 Ellie who wrote who had three different
03:49:25.260 cabinet appointments if I remember right
03:49:28.800 said no man was fit to hold public
03:49:30.779 office it wasn't perfectly willing to
03:49:32.880 leave it at any time
03:49:34.439 and the fellow who wrote didn't approve
03:49:37.260 of something the government asked him to
03:49:38.640 do he could always go back and be the
03:49:40.200 most sought after lawyer in the world
03:49:42.300 he had an identity to go back to and he
03:49:45.060 didn't need the government's salary
03:49:47.640 and
03:49:49.200 I think that ought to be more the test
03:49:52.140 in corporate directorships is a man
03:49:55.620 really fit to make tough calls who isn't
03:49:57.960 perfectly willing to leave the office at
03:49:59.640 any time
03:50:01.800 my answer is no
03:50:04.979 yeah we have one of our directors who
03:50:07.020 was
03:50:08.160 who's been removed twice from
03:50:10.739 compensation Committees of other
03:50:13.020 corporations because he had the temerity
03:50:15.359 to actually question whether the
03:50:17.700 compensation
03:50:19.140 Arrangement being suggested was the
03:50:21.720 appropriate one I mean it uh
03:50:24.180 it's not it's it's it's
03:50:26.819 being put on the
03:50:28.739 comp Committee of American corporations
03:50:30.660 as I've said they're not
03:50:32.640 they're looking for Chihuahuas and and
03:50:34.859 and not Great Danes and governments and
03:50:37.859 uh
03:50:40.620 yeah and I hope I'm not insulting any of
03:50:42.300 my friends that are on cop committees
03:50:44.180 you're insulting the dogs
03:50:46.370 [Laughter]
03:50:48.010 [Applause]
03:50:56.880 okay number one
03:51:00.180 number seven
03:51:02.220 well it's more uh it's more
03:51:03.960 nerve-wracking than I thought it would
03:51:05.160 be
03:51:06.600 um hello Warren Charlie
03:51:09.779 um my name is Aki progakis I'm from
03:51:12.300 Montreal Canada
03:51:14.100 a Warren I wrote a letter back in
03:51:16.560 January um I wrote a letter to you
03:51:18.540 recommending a beautiful Canadian retail
03:51:20.460 company in which I described the my
03:51:22.680 analysis to you I'd like to thank you
03:51:25.439 for taking the time to respond to me uh
03:51:27.960 you said some nice kind words it meant a
03:51:29.760 lot to me and I think you're an amazing
03:51:31.319 individual
03:51:33.899 um my question uh
03:51:36.600 people what is the single most difficult
03:51:38.939 decision you've had to make in your
03:51:40.620 lifetime whether it be business or
03:51:42.420 personal
03:51:46.200 I think I want to let Charlie answer
03:51:47.640 that one first
03:51:49.680 yeah I would argue that that may be one
03:51:52.260 that you shouldn't ask
03:51:58.310 [Applause]
03:52:00.779 Ed or let's put it this way I think you
03:52:02.700 should answer it with several
03:52:04.020 interesting examples before you ask us
03:52:06.300 to answer
03:52:07.460 [Music]
03:52:09.560 that's a little dirty joke
03:52:13.859 it's interesting but as Charlie was
03:52:16.500 talking I was
03:52:18.479 I haven't I I
03:52:20.460 I can't think of a lot of difficult I
03:52:22.680 think of a lot of wrong decisions I've
03:52:24.300 made
03:52:25.140 uh
03:52:26.700 but I I certainly can't think of
03:52:29.939 I can't think of anything I agonized
03:52:32.939 over making for any long period of time
03:52:35.340 uh like I say that isn't you know I mean
03:52:39.000 it's calling balls and Strikes I mean
03:52:40.620 you gotta you got a second there and if
03:52:42.540 you don't do it that you're you're no
03:52:44.100 longer an Umpire uh so
03:52:48.479 I uh I made I made plenty of wrong
03:52:51.060 decisions I'm going to make plenty more
03:52:52.319 that that that's just part of the living
03:52:54.600 but
03:52:55.560 I don't I don't think in terms of being
03:52:59.040 difficult as measured by the time it
03:53:02.040 took me
03:53:03.479 to do it or the uh
03:53:06.020 not a lot of them pop to mind and if
03:53:08.520 they do I'll probably
03:53:10.020 I'll probably give you the same answer
03:53:11.880 surely Charlie Charlie have you thought
03:53:13.560 of any more there while we were talking
03:53:15.000 oh
03:53:17.340 let's go on to another okay
03:53:20.640 that was not a bad decision number eight
03:53:25.560 would you say that the USS uh
03:53:27.960 quote-unquote a castle with a moat and
03:53:31.200 if so
03:53:32.220 how can we make the mode any bigger
03:53:35.040 thank you yeah well the US has been
03:53:37.020 pretty remarkable as I indicated in my
03:53:39.960 earlier
03:53:40.920 comment I mean
03:53:42.600 you know essentially the the same
03:53:44.520 population pool pretty much and and
03:53:47.540 they've garnered over this 215-year
03:53:50.640 period
03:53:51.779 a remarkable share of the world's wealth
03:53:54.840 uh and it's an interesting question as
03:53:57.899 to
03:53:58.739 just why this
03:54:00.600 group of people here
03:54:02.399 have been able to do so much better
03:54:05.580 than the rest of the world considering
03:54:07.080 we're not any smarter or anything of the
03:54:08.700 smart and uh
03:54:11.819 um
03:54:12.600 it's not an economic hassle anymore I
03:54:14.939 wouldn't I wouldn't call it that
03:54:18.000 what we do is no secret
03:54:20.399 and I think that the relative importance
03:54:23.939 of America I mean
03:54:26.399 when you know we've
03:54:28.140 we have been a dominant factor in the
03:54:30.060 world and
03:54:31.739 post-world War II and I think it will
03:54:34.620 decline somewhat although I'm not an
03:54:36.300 alarmist on that but I think to some
03:54:38.640 extent the rest of the world or much of
03:54:40.380 the rest or some of the rest of the
03:54:41.580 world is catching on
03:54:43.739 and adopting some you know sort of best
03:54:46.140 practices as they say in industry
03:54:48.840 and
03:54:50.100 our
03:54:51.979 our Castle will grow in size but there
03:54:55.140 will be more castles
03:54:56.760 around it and I basically think that's a
03:54:58.859 very good thing for the world I think
03:55:00.060 the more prosperous generally the rest
03:55:02.399 of the world is
03:55:03.960 uh you know the better generally it will
03:55:07.739 be for us and you know I've talked about
03:55:09.960 our trade problems the more trade we
03:55:12.660 have the better
03:55:13.979 we had 1.1 trillion
03:55:16.739 of real trade last year in the country
03:55:19.080 we would have with the world and then we
03:55:21.600 had another 600 billion six tenths of a
03:55:24.180 trillion that unilaterally we bought
03:55:26.640 well I I would love to see the 1.1
03:55:29.460 trillion grow and grow and grow it'd be
03:55:31.140 good for us and good for the rest of the
03:55:32.520 world but I don't think that our
03:55:34.920 Prosperity will come in the future will
03:55:37.979 come at the expense of the rest of the
03:55:39.540 world at all and I I do think that there
03:55:42.420 were parts of the world
03:55:43.920 that will grow
03:55:45.979 economically from a lower base but much
03:55:48.720 faster than the US and basically I think
03:55:50.580 that's that's a good thing I mean
03:55:52.260 there's six billion people in this world
03:55:53.819 and a lot of them don't live very well
03:55:55.920 and and I would hope that 20 or 50 years
03:55:58.140 from now that it's a higher percentage
03:56:00.359 of them would live well and that but I
03:56:02.220 don't think it comes out of our height
03:56:03.420 at all Charlie
03:56:05.699 well I don't think it comes out of our
03:56:07.500 height in that sense but
03:56:09.479 if we're
03:56:11.760 well I don't think it comes out of our
03:56:13.380 height in that sense but
03:56:15.420 if we are now the richest and most
03:56:18.239 powerful nation in the world and 50 or
03:56:20.760 100 years from now now the richest and
03:56:22.920 most powerful nation in the world and 50
03:56:25.500 or 100 years from now we're a poor third
03:56:29.399 some country in Asia uh sure we're
03:56:32.880 richer but it's A peculiar type of
03:56:36.300 richness where you've lost your relative
03:56:37.979 position in the world
03:56:39.600 uh
03:56:41.340 it's not all I think
03:56:44.760 if I had to bet I would bet that the
03:56:47.040 part of the world that does best is Asia
03:56:49.859 in terms of percentage gains per annum
03:56:53.160 and uh and I think it might do amazingly
03:56:56.220 well if it doesn't
03:56:57.600 blow up in some way and if it does
03:57:00.000 amazingly well
03:57:01.739 it will eventually be a much richer
03:57:03.779 place than
03:57:05.040 than ours
03:57:08.819 my understanding is that the University
03:57:10.800 of Florida
03:57:12.300 has instituted a couple of courses that
03:57:14.779 actually Mason Hawkins gave them a
03:57:17.580 significant amount of money to finance
03:57:20.460 and I believe they're
03:57:23.040 they're teaching something other than
03:57:24.600 efficient markets there there's there's
03:57:26.760 a very good course at Columbia I know
03:57:28.319 that it gets a lot of visiting
03:57:31.319 uh teachers to come in I I go in there
03:57:34.380 and teach occasionally and and and
03:57:36.540 but a number of practitioners do so
03:57:38.460 they're I think the efficient market uh
03:57:41.699 theory is less wholly written now than
03:57:44.399 it was 15 or 20 years ago and
03:57:46.800 in uh in universities but it's it it's
03:57:51.060 there's a lot of a talk but I think you
03:57:52.620 can find more diversity in what is being
03:57:54.720 offered now than than 10 or 20 years ago
03:57:56.760 and I'd recommend you know looking into
03:57:58.260 those
03:57:59.160 to schools you know it's really quite
03:58:01.260 useful
03:58:02.520 uh
03:58:03.899 if you had a merchant shipping business
03:58:05.819 if all of your competitors believe the
03:58:07.979 World is Flat
03:58:09.420 you know that it is a huge Edge because
03:58:11.640 they will not take any uh they will not
03:58:14.040 take on any any cargo to uh to go to
03:58:17.580 places that are Beyond where they think
03:58:18.779 they will fall off and so we should be
03:58:21.239 encouraging
03:58:22.500 the teaching of efficient market
03:58:23.880 theories in in universities and
03:58:28.560 it amazes it it amazes me but what it
03:58:31.380 you know it I think one time that uh
03:58:34.380 was it canes that said that uh most
03:58:37.680 economists are most economical about
03:58:39.779 ideas that they make the ones they
03:58:41.279 learned in graduate school last a
03:58:42.660 lifetime and what happens is that you
03:58:46.080 spend years getting your PhD in finance
03:58:48.540 and you
03:58:49.560 you learn theories with a lot of
03:58:51.300 mathematics and then that the average
03:58:53.160 Layman can't uh can't do and and you
03:58:56.399 become sort of a high priest
03:58:58.319 and you get an enormous
03:59:00.600 come out of yourself an ego and even
03:59:03.779 Professional Security
03:59:05.779 invested in those ideas and it gets very
03:59:08.939 hard to back off after after a given
03:59:11.279 point and I think that to some extent
03:59:13.620 has contaminated that uh the teaching of
03:59:16.800 investing
03:59:18.120 in the universities Charlie
03:59:20.580 well I would argue that the
03:59:22.319 contamination was massive
03:59:27.720 but it's waning it yeah it is waning
03:59:30.479 it's winning it the good ideas
03:59:31.920 eventually Triumph
