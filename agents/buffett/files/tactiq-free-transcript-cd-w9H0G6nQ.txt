00:00:16.000 well
00:00:16.720 a berkshire hathaway uh shareholders
00:00:18.400 meeting is
00:00:19.760 partly a um uh
00:00:23.519 a class in business it's partly a fun
00:00:26.000 festival it's sort of a
00:00:27.840 mardi gras for people that come every
00:00:29.599 year
00:00:31.599 it's a chance for us to have a lot of
00:00:33.840 fun and meet the people that have
00:00:35.120 entrusted us
00:00:36.719 with their money and we want to make
00:00:38.800 sure they have a good time and we hope
00:00:40.239 they learn
00:00:40.800 more about the not only berkshire but
00:00:43.360 just the attitude they should have
00:00:45.360 uh toward investments in general
00:00:51.039 we're a berkshire as a corporation
00:00:54.480 but it goes beyond that in in in
00:00:57.520 in terms of our our feeling toward the
00:01:00.000 people who are shareholders
00:01:01.440 we regard them as our partners uh
00:01:03.440 charlie and i are the managing partners
00:01:05.600 uh the others are are are silent
00:01:08.799 partners but
00:01:09.760 uh the attitude is partnership they're
00:01:12.000 they're not some
00:01:13.439 uh faceless group of people and that's
00:01:15.920 why at the annual meeting i you know i
00:01:17.439 love seeing forty thousand of them or so
00:01:19.200 it's it
00:01:19.759 it gives real meaning to what we're
00:01:21.040 doing every day
00:01:25.439 you know i i'm probably one of the few
00:01:28.400 ceos that actually enjoys
00:01:30.079 writing the annual report or as some
00:01:32.880 writers say i enjoy
00:01:34.079 having written them having written the
00:01:36.000 the the actual process of writing could
00:01:37.759 be
00:01:38.159 a lot of work but i want to uh
00:01:41.680 i want to tell them uh uh
00:01:44.880 or talk to them about what i would like
00:01:47.200 to know if our positions were reversed
00:01:49.040 and they were running the company and i
00:01:50.320 was the
00:01:51.200 shareholder so i i mentally envisioned
00:01:54.399 my
00:01:54.880 two sisters doris and bertie they're
00:01:57.280 very very smart
00:01:58.640 they have a very high percentage of
00:02:00.159 their net worth in berkshire so they're
00:02:01.840 interested
00:02:02.719 but they're not following business day
00:02:04.399 to day so i i
00:02:06.000 pretend that they've been gone for a
00:02:08.239 year and
00:02:09.038 i'm bringing them up to date about the
00:02:10.800 kind of things i would like to
00:02:12.319 to know if they were running the
00:02:13.520 business i was uh the silent partner
00:02:19.120 yeah ted williams wrote a book called
00:02:20.640 the science of hitting and ended he had
00:02:22.560 a uh
00:02:23.599 a picture of himself at bat and the
00:02:26.160 strike zone
00:02:27.520 broken into i think 77 uh
00:02:30.959 uh squares uh all the way from
00:02:34.480 the letters down to his knees and the
00:02:36.319 width of the plate and he said if he
00:02:38.879 the most important thing in in batting
00:02:42.000 was to
00:02:42.720 wait for the right pitch that if he
00:02:44.080 waited for the pitch that was really in
00:02:46.000 his sweet spot
00:02:47.040 he would bat 400 and if he had to swing
00:02:49.200 at something on the lower
00:02:51.120 corner he would probably bat 235 and
00:02:54.239 and in investing uh i'm in a no
00:02:57.519 called strike business which is the best
00:02:59.200 business you can be and
00:03:00.560 if if the count on ted went to 0 owen
00:03:03.200 two or one and two he
00:03:04.560 and that ball came across the plate in
00:03:06.480 the in that corner where he only batted
00:03:08.159 235 he still had to swing or he would
00:03:10.000 have been called out
00:03:11.440 in investing there are no call strikes i
00:03:13.200 can look at a thousand different
00:03:14.319 companies
00:03:15.120 and i don't have to be right on every
00:03:16.879 one of them or or
00:03:18.640 even 50 of them or even 25 of them i
00:03:21.280 just
00:03:22.000 the only the only way i can have a
00:03:23.840 strike call is if i swing and miss so i
00:03:25.840 can pick the ball i want to hit
00:03:27.440 and i can wait there and the pitcher can
00:03:29.120 throw pitch after pitch and if they are
00:03:30.720 not in my sweet spot
00:03:32.000 i don't have to swing and that's an
00:03:34.480 enormous advantage
00:03:35.840 over most businesses the problem of
00:03:37.840 course is that if you have an audience
00:03:40.080 that says yelling swing you bum while
00:03:42.720 you're waiting there with a bet on your
00:03:43.920 shoulder time after time you may get
00:03:45.280 tempted to
00:03:46.000 swing at the wrong pitches so you have
00:03:47.360 to make sure you're
00:03:49.760 that you don't psychologically get in
00:03:51.760 the position where you feel
00:03:52.959 you have to swing at pitches that really
00:03:54.480 aren't in your sweet spot
00:03:59.439 yeah probably probably if i make one
00:04:00.959 great decision every two years i'm
00:04:04.000 you have to make very very few right
00:04:06.000 decisions in investing in your life
00:04:07.599 you might say that a person who bought
00:04:08.879 berkshire hathaway 50 years ago only had
00:04:11.120 to make one decision and
00:04:12.400 and there's a temptation for people to
00:04:16.000 act far too frequently in stock simply
00:04:18.720 because they're so liquid
00:04:19.918 they know they can't buy and sell farms
00:04:21.440 every day or buy and sell apartment
00:04:22.880 houses every day
00:04:23.919 they can buy and sell stocks and that's
00:04:26.320 and in a very liquid market with very
00:04:28.160 low transaction costs and that should be
00:04:29.919 a huge advantage
00:04:31.199 but people turn it into a disadvantage
00:04:33.120 because they think the availability of
00:04:35.840 the opportunity to trade uh
00:04:38.880 is something that they have to uh take
00:04:41.919 advantage of every day and actually
00:04:43.600 active trading just costs them a lot of
00:04:45.600 commissions the main thing to do is buy
00:04:47.600 into a wonderful business and just sit
00:04:49.199 there with it
00:04:54.000 i don't i would say i get very very
00:04:56.479 little
00:04:57.840 hate mail uh uh
00:05:02.400 i i get a lot of requests for money and
00:05:06.000 i had one fellow that would ask me for
00:05:08.240 1.3 billion he broke me about 70 times
00:05:10.560 and he never dropped his price i kind of
00:05:12.160 admired his
00:05:13.360 position of non-negotiation but
00:05:16.639 i uh
00:05:19.680 there may be a social but probably when
00:05:21.680 i uh wrote about taxes i got i got a few
00:05:24.479 letters saying you know why don't you
00:05:25.759 just
00:05:26.720 uh send all your money to the u.s
00:05:28.240 government if you think it's so
00:05:29.199 wonderful
00:05:30.320 but i i would say there's very very very
00:05:32.720 little hate mail
00:05:37.680 well omaha and nebraska are home to me
00:05:39.759 and and and
00:05:40.720 uh uh i had a great time uh
00:05:44.560 growing up here until i was about 12 and
00:05:46.320 we moved to washington i
00:05:47.919 made lots of friends uh everything about
00:05:50.800 it seems like home i go back
00:05:52.800 uh i've probably gone back at least a
00:05:54.560 half a dozen times to my grammar school
00:05:56.720 rose hill and i go there for fairs they
00:06:00.080 may have occasionally i might even talk
00:06:02.000 to a
00:06:02.880 great school class or two i uh there's a
00:06:06.160 lot of
00:06:07.600 continuity there's a lot of community
00:06:09.600 there's a lot of friendship
00:06:11.199 uh i know the i probably know the
00:06:14.560 parents the grandparents now a lot of
00:06:16.319 people i meet
00:06:17.360 but if i go to a restaurant here there's
00:06:20.720 there's a lot of people just say hi
00:06:22.000 warren to me that that either i know or
00:06:24.639 that
00:06:25.680 that they're just friendly my children
00:06:29.039 had a good time growing up here
00:06:32.240 they had their aunts and uncles and
00:06:34.400 grandparents uh
00:06:35.759 living within a mile or two uh uh so
00:06:38.960 it's been
00:06:40.080 it's a very solid place and friendly
00:06:42.000 place uh in which to
00:06:43.840 uh grow up in in which to conduct a
00:06:46.240 business uh we have
00:06:49.039 25 people in the office and
00:06:52.880 if you go back a year ago to our
00:06:54.880 christmas party we're going to take a
00:06:55.840 picture of the 25 this year
00:06:57.599 it's the exact same 25 as a year ago the
00:07:00.160 exact same ones now we have a company
00:07:01.919 with 350
00:07:03.039 000 employees and here in the
00:07:05.039 headquarters i don't think there's
00:07:06.080 another company in the world that
00:07:07.199 probably didn't have
00:07:08.080 that we didn't go up one we didn't go
00:07:09.599 down one and we didn't change one
00:07:15.120 well working in omaha certainly
00:07:17.840 maximizes both
00:07:19.919 my enjoyment and my output in terms of
00:07:22.160 work i mean
00:07:23.280 everything is is made to order i live
00:07:26.160 five minutes away
00:07:27.440 from the office and i've been making
00:07:29.599 that five-minute trip back and forth now
00:07:32.240 for
00:07:33.520 what um 53 years uh
00:07:37.120 uh you know there's no stress i have i
00:07:40.000 have no stress whatsoever
00:07:41.840 in business that uh i think it's
00:07:44.560 probably helped me not only
00:07:46.800 live longer but and certainly live
00:07:48.960 happier as well
00:07:53.360 i had a when i came back from new york
00:07:56.639 in early 1956 uh i had no idea what i
00:08:00.800 was going to do i knew i was going to
00:08:02.240 take some classes at school i knew i was
00:08:04.240 going to do a lot of reading
00:08:05.759 i had no idea that i would set up an
00:08:07.599 investment partnership
00:08:09.759 but a few months after i came back some
00:08:11.280 members of the family uh
00:08:13.120 said what should we do with our money
00:08:14.479 and i said well i'm not going back in
00:08:16.240 the business of selling stocks but if
00:08:17.759 you would like to join me in a
00:08:18.960 partnership
00:08:19.680 uh somewhat along the lines of the one
00:08:21.840 i'd worked
00:08:22.720 for when i was with ben graham i said
00:08:24.800 i'll be glad to do it so
00:08:26.400 within a couple of months after coming
00:08:27.919 back i set up the first partnership
00:08:29.919 and i was then renting a house i never
00:08:33.039 owned a house to that point and
00:08:34.719 i was renting a house at uh a block and
00:08:37.200 a half away from the family grocery
00:08:38.719 store
00:08:39.279 and it had a little tiny room off the
00:08:42.399 bedroom and
00:08:43.360 that became the office and then two
00:08:45.920 years later i bought the house i live in
00:08:47.760 today in 1958
00:08:49.920 and that too had a room off the bedroom
00:08:52.399 and i worked out of that
00:08:54.240 room for about four years so there was
00:08:57.519 about six years in which i
00:08:59.680 uh worked at home i drove down and
00:09:03.279 picked up the mail
00:09:05.519 i wrote checks eventually i was running
00:09:08.240 11 partnerships finally i wrote all the
00:09:10.080 checks individually i filed 11 income
00:09:12.160 tax returns i took delivery on stocks
00:09:14.240 for
00:09:14.720 all the different companies i i was a
00:09:17.120 one-man band there for six years
00:09:23.360 there came a time at the start of 1962
00:09:26.399 i i moved to kiwi plaza they were just
00:09:29.200 building the building then
00:09:30.320 and finishing it and
00:09:33.600 i hired two people one one was a
00:09:36.959 secretary and one was a
00:09:39.200 a fellow that analyzed investments with
00:09:40.959 me bill scott
00:09:42.480 bill and i are still friends he still
00:09:43.920 lives in omaha and
00:09:46.480 and we started to look like we were
00:09:48.480 really were a business
00:09:49.519 by the time i moved to keyword plaza we
00:09:51.200 had seven million dollars in invested
00:09:53.440 we started the first partnership started
00:09:54.959 with a hundred and five thousand one
00:09:56.399 hundred dollars
00:09:57.360 i put up the hundred and the other
00:09:58.560 people put up the hundred and five
00:09:59.760 thousand
00:10:00.560 and then as as people came along uh and
00:10:05.760 saw what was being done in the earlier
00:10:07.440 partnerships i made this mistake of
00:10:08.880 forming new partnerships so
00:10:10.720 i had this multiple uh
00:10:14.560 multiple checks multiple tax returns and
00:10:16.560 all that sort of thing
00:10:17.760 finally it just made sense to put them
00:10:19.120 together so when i put it together in
00:10:21.040 january 1st 1962 we had 7 million
00:10:25.760 and a lot of that was new people that
00:10:28.560 had come in over the years and
00:10:30.079 and some but fair amount was profits
00:10:36.079 i closed down the partnerships well just
00:10:38.800 one partnership by that point
00:10:40.399 i closed down the partnership at the end
00:10:41.920 of 1969
00:10:44.000 because i really wasn't seeing uh
00:10:46.640 opportunities in the investment world
00:10:48.800 and
00:10:49.120 and and there were some crazy things
00:10:51.360 going on in the late 60s and
00:10:53.760 i didn't want to do i understood what
00:10:56.480 people were doing but i didn't believe
00:10:57.839 in what they were doing
00:10:59.279 so i didn't want to join that game on
00:11:01.519 the other hand i didn't like
00:11:02.959 sending it out and having having my
00:11:05.279 results look bad
00:11:06.720 so i decided to give the money back to
00:11:09.600 the partners i didn't think
00:11:12.240 i didn't want my competitive juices to
00:11:14.720 to force me to play in a game
00:11:16.399 where i really didn't think i had an
00:11:17.839 advantage anymore uh
00:11:19.519 so uh it was a it was a
00:11:23.519 lifestyle decision i had all the money i
00:11:26.240 needed and the partners had all done
00:11:27.839 well
00:11:28.480 and i had a way of providing for their
00:11:30.240 continued uh
00:11:31.680 shepherding by a couple of friends of
00:11:33.680 mine that were very good managers
00:11:36.800 the i had various social ideas too but
00:11:40.720 the two were not in conflict i could
00:11:42.240 have gone on on
00:11:44.000 on a double track throughout the rest of
00:11:45.839 my life and
00:11:47.040 and in a certain sense i have uh but not
00:11:50.000 in
00:11:50.399 i didn't have that all planned out back
00:11:52.000 in 1969 when i decided to wind up the
00:11:54.839 partnership
00:11:58.560 there was a time in in the late 60s when
00:12:02.399 my wife susie said to me she said i
00:12:04.639 don't mind being married
00:12:06.320 to the next to last guy in the country
00:12:08.160 to have a crew cut but she's i really
00:12:09.680 wouldn't want to be married to the last
00:12:11.040 guy so
00:12:11.680 at that point at that point i left the
00:12:13.839 crew cut style
00:12:19.040 we had a we had a terrific and susie was
00:12:20.720 great at planning parties and so
00:12:22.880 she was very imaginative we had loads of
00:12:25.279 friends uh
00:12:26.160 and uh uh so i like i liked the stage
00:12:29.839 delicatessen in new york so when we were
00:12:31.519 in new york i'd
00:12:32.720 we'd always go by there susie and i uh
00:12:35.200 so she decided to have a stage
00:12:36.399 delegation party in
00:12:38.000 in omaha and uh i don't know how many
00:12:41.360 people we had we had a lot of people
00:12:42.800 over that uh
00:12:43.760 that night and everybody had a lot of
00:12:45.120 fun it was it was the
00:12:46.800 it was the 1960s and and
00:12:50.160 she was imaginative about parties and
00:12:52.160 and and she was good at it she
00:12:54.240 she threw herself into it and came up
00:12:56.160 with a lot of great ideas and
00:12:57.760 i just went and ate the food and paid
00:13:00.480 the bills
00:13:06.320 the partnership had acquired control of
00:13:08.160 berkshire hathaway in 1965
00:13:10.800 and although i never took the chairman's
00:13:12.800 role or the president's role
00:13:14.240 i was in charge of berkshire hathaway we
00:13:15.839 owned control of it so
00:13:18.720 i made all the decisions i bought
00:13:20.800 national indemnity i bought this on
00:13:22.320 newspapers for it
00:13:24.240 the fellow who operated the textile
00:13:25.839 business checked with me on
00:13:27.680 buying new equipment and so i was the
00:13:31.120 ceo but i never saw
00:13:32.720 there was no reason to take the title
00:13:34.240 malcolm chase who was chairman was a
00:13:35.920 wonderful gentleman who had helped me in
00:13:37.839 acquiring control of berkshire so there
00:13:40.160 was no reason to
00:13:41.519 change his title he would remain the
00:13:43.279 chairman but he
00:13:44.639 he was not running the business he he
00:13:47.199 let me run the business and
00:13:48.800 there was no need it was clear that
00:13:50.240 buffett partnership was the controlling
00:13:51.760 shareholder
00:13:52.639 when we dissolved the partnership at the
00:13:54.560 end of 1969 and distributed the
00:13:57.120 the berkshire stock uh i took on the
00:13:59.600 title of chairman just
00:14:01.040 to formalize it going forward now that
00:14:03.040 the control block had really been
00:14:04.959 broken up with our various partners but
00:14:07.199 nothing really changed in 1970 from 1969
00:14:14.959 well i think i think the desire to
00:14:17.760 participate in
00:14:19.839 uh some of the conversation on
00:14:23.120 things like civil rights or or uh
00:14:27.040 the right to family planning or
00:14:28.560 something like that i mean it
00:14:30.639 if i can't speak out on who can i mean
00:14:33.360 you know i can't be
00:14:34.240 damaged in terms of my employer firing
00:14:37.440 me because i
00:14:39.040 made some talk someplace and and uh
00:14:42.959 uh so i've i've had strong feelings on
00:14:47.279 certain social policies uh you can't pop
00:14:50.000 off too
00:14:50.720 too often i mean there's uh some very
00:14:53.279 very rich guy who goes around the pining
00:14:55.199 on everything
00:14:56.399 can get a little get a little boring
00:14:58.560 after a while so i
00:15:00.240 i don't want to do it too often but when
00:15:02.800 i do see myself paying a lower tax rate
00:15:05.279 than anybody else in the office i mean
00:15:07.040 that bothers me then that
00:15:09.600 the degree of inequality in our in the
00:15:13.440 richest society that the world has ever
00:15:15.680 seen uh
00:15:16.800 bothers me i don't want to throw away
00:15:19.199 that greatest society that's ever
00:15:20.720 existed in the process of changing
00:15:22.240 things but i
00:15:23.440 uh i get i feel like speaking out i like
00:15:26.399 running berkshire but i
00:15:27.839 but i can't i can't pretend i'm not a
00:15:30.320 citizen either when
00:15:32.880 i've said at the shareholders meeting
00:15:34.959 that uh
00:15:36.399 i'm willing to work for a very small
00:15:38.800 salary but i'm not willing to
00:15:40.399 i'm not willing to put my morals in a
00:15:42.000 blind trust and uh
00:15:44.160 that does not come with a job so if if
00:15:46.560 people that are shareholders of
00:15:48.079 berkshire
00:15:49.120 are bothered a little bit about me
00:15:50.720 speaking on taxes or something of sort
00:15:53.440 you know they'll either have to accept
00:15:55.440 it or go elsewhere because i
00:15:57.839 i really don't feel i should give up my
00:15:59.279 citizenship just because i have a
00:16:01.519 a job as as head of a major corporation
00:16:07.920 america
00:16:08.720 america has been unbelievably good to me
00:16:12.399 and the and my family i you know there
00:16:14.480 were there's 7 billion people in this
00:16:16.639 world only 320 million plus
00:16:19.040 in the united states i mean i was very
00:16:21.680 very lucky to be
00:16:23.360 born in this country and have and and
00:16:25.519 and in the time when
00:16:26.720 america's prospered like never before so
00:16:29.120 it
00:16:30.560 uh and it isn't because i'm a better
00:16:33.199 person
00:16:34.320 than the guy next door i just i'm wired
00:16:36.880 in a certain way
00:16:38.320 that enables me just like some people to
00:16:40.800 go to chess some people are going to
00:16:42.240 bridge some
00:16:42.880 you know some people are good at writing
00:16:45.040 musical scores
00:16:46.399 i happen to be good at something that
00:16:47.920 pays off enormously
00:16:49.759 in this society would have paid off that
00:16:52.000 well 200 years ago it wouldn't have paid
00:16:53.839 off that well in many other countries
00:16:56.079 so america's been extraordinary for me
00:16:58.959 and
00:17:00.959 and it's going to be even better in the
00:17:02.480 future overall
00:17:04.160 so i just i would like to see everybody
00:17:06.240 participate not equally at all
00:17:08.480 but but nobody should have a
00:17:11.760 bad economic future in the united states
00:17:14.240 we can afford for
00:17:15.439 everybody to have a who's willing to
00:17:17.520 work to get a decent result in the
00:17:19.919 society
00:17:24.880 well the best the the best gift i was
00:17:27.199 ever given
00:17:27.919 uh was to have a father that i had when
00:17:30.160 i was born i made it
00:17:32.160 you know i had nothing to do with that
00:17:34.799 uh
00:17:35.760 i was also i i was genetically
00:17:39.039 blessed with a certain wiring that's
00:17:41.200 very useful in a
00:17:42.559 in a highly developed market system
00:17:44.400 where there's there's lots of chips on
00:17:46.400 the table and
00:17:47.360 you know i happen to be good at that
00:17:49.120 game and other people
00:17:50.799 are wonderful with their hands in
00:17:52.240 medicine they could do things surgically
00:17:53.840 that i never could do other people
00:17:55.200 couldn't
00:17:55.760 be out magnificently there's all kinds
00:17:57.840 of different gifts but i happen to be
00:17:59.120 given one
00:18:00.160 that that has enormous commercial value
00:18:03.039 at this time in this country uh
00:18:06.240 so i would uh but where i've really been
00:18:08.880 blessed
00:18:09.440 is is with the people that i've come in
00:18:11.840 contact with
00:18:12.960 some of them i i'll give myself a little
00:18:15.039 credit for for choosing to be associated
00:18:17.280 with but
00:18:18.080 if you start off with my dad i had no no
00:18:20.320 no uh
00:18:21.360 no voice in that and and just think of
00:18:24.720 this you know wonderful start that gave
00:18:26.400 me in the first
00:18:28.480 20 years of my life for really as long
00:18:30.559 as he lived
00:18:35.360 well charlie munger has been a wonderful
00:18:38.080 partner
00:18:38.799 he uh he's ungodly smart
00:18:42.000 he's he's he's got a much broader
00:18:43.760 intellect than i do he's
00:18:45.200 he's he's he's a smarter guy in about
00:18:48.320 100 fields than that i am
00:18:51.760 and he's he's
00:18:55.760 magnificent at being able to condense
00:18:57.840 important ideas into
00:18:59.440 just a very few words and uh he's always
00:19:02.640 honest in
00:19:03.520 in in what he tells me so i i listened
00:19:05.919 to him
00:19:06.559 in fact i just changed my behavior on
00:19:08.320 something last week
00:19:10.160 because of uh of uh probably a 10 word
00:19:13.679 sentence he
00:19:14.960 he said to me in investing
00:19:18.480 he had a big impact on me in in
00:19:22.480 moving me somewhat away from ben graham
00:19:24.720 and looking for
00:19:26.000 really wonderful companies at fair
00:19:28.320 prices rather than fair companies at
00:19:30.240 wonderful prices
00:19:31.520 so so he he moved me toward quality
00:19:34.320 businesses
00:19:35.520 and that was enormously important
00:19:37.200 because it enabled berkshire to scale up
00:19:39.200 in a way that would have been impossible
00:19:41.360 buying the kind of of lower grade
00:19:44.240 businesses we bought at cheap prices
00:19:45.919 originally
00:19:51.360 well susie uh when i was
00:19:55.039 in my teens uh uh i developed
00:19:58.720 uh
00:20:02.000 really pretty decent skills in terms of
00:20:04.559 business or
00:20:05.440 but but i hadn't really come to terms
00:20:08.000 with the world exactly
00:20:09.760 and uh i was an unbalanced individual i
00:20:13.440 may still be but
00:20:14.559 but she uh susie
00:20:17.840 really put me together and uh
00:20:21.039 she was the one that had the little
00:20:23.120 watering can and
00:20:24.559 i was the seed in the uh in the soil but
00:20:27.039 that it took the watering can
00:20:29.039 uh from susie to uh to help me
00:20:32.640 really grow up and mature
00:20:36.799 she was a wonderful person and uh
00:20:41.280 she believed in me she she she she put
00:20:44.000 me together and
00:20:45.520 i would i would not have been
00:20:48.640 uh i would not only turn out to be the
00:20:51.120 person i'd
00:20:51.760 turned up me but i i would not have i
00:20:53.520 actually wouldn't have been as
00:20:54.320 successful in business without that
00:20:56.960 uh she made me more of a whole person
00:20:59.280 she never cared about
00:21:01.039 money or or business at all
00:21:04.159 one time we had dinner with a friend of
00:21:05.679 mine her wolf in new york and as we were
00:21:07.440 coming back on the subway
00:21:08.960 to manhattan he lived out out of ways
00:21:12.480 she said warren she said how many
00:21:15.039 hundred thousands are there in a million
00:21:16.960 uh and at that time i i knew i shouldn't
00:21:19.840 turn the checkbook over
00:21:26.080 well i don't know that you know you'll
00:21:28.080 have to go to rogers and hammerstein or
00:21:29.679 somebody to
00:21:30.640 figure out exactly what happens when you
00:21:32.320 meet somebody and
00:21:33.679 you know that stranger across the room
00:21:35.440 or something of the sort but
00:21:36.960 but i knew she was for me so i i didn't
00:21:39.120 waste any time i
00:21:40.799 i uh i wasn't getting any place for
00:21:44.000 but my pursuit was was avid and and uh
00:21:48.240 so she she married me when she was 19
00:21:50.159 and i was 21. i bought the ring i told
00:21:52.240 bill gates
00:21:52.960 when i was trying to sell him a rig when
00:21:54.480 he was going to get married in 19
00:21:56.559 he got married on january 1st 1994 i
00:21:58.799 said i spent six percent of my net worth
00:22:01.039 on my ring for susie so i think when you
00:22:02.880 come out to our jewelry store that
00:22:04.640 that's just it's a guideline but uh you
00:22:07.039 know you might bury it a little bit but
00:22:08.559 six percent is more or less the standard
00:22:10.240 amount
00:22:10.880 the wedding gate was kind of interesting
00:22:12.240 because i was a member of the national
00:22:13.600 guard
00:22:14.640 uh here in nebraska and on april 19th
00:22:17.840 in 1952 the missouri river was
00:22:21.360 coming up over its banks and i was
00:22:23.679 getting married at three in the
00:22:24.880 afternoon and at
00:22:26.080 noon i got a call and the guy i
00:22:29.760 answered the phone and fellow said
00:22:31.760 corporal buffett and i said yes sir and
00:22:33.360 he said this is captain murphy and
00:22:35.440 he said what time are you getting
00:22:36.559 married i said three o'clock he said
00:22:38.640 well
00:22:39.360 we've been activated so be at the armory
00:22:41.280 at five so that was
00:22:43.200 uh that was not an auspicious start for
00:22:46.000 the uh
00:22:46.640 wedding day and then a little while
00:22:48.400 later i got a call from
00:22:50.159 the commanding general of the 34th
00:22:51.760 division and he said i'm countermanding
00:22:53.360 captain murphy's
00:22:54.480 orders so go and have a great time on
00:22:56.480 the honeymoon uh
00:22:57.840 fortunately my uh the original call
00:23:00.960 from captain murphy captain murphy
00:23:02.559 stuttered somewhat and otherwise i would
00:23:04.159 have thought it was one of the
00:23:05.919 the ushers in the wedding or something
00:23:08.080 playing a game out of me i might have
00:23:09.520 i might have made some comment that
00:23:10.880 would have landed me in the bearings for
00:23:12.640 a few months i
00:23:13.520 did not wear my glasses in my wedding i
00:23:15.039 can't i couldn't then i think one of the
00:23:17.360 eyes has been corrected somewhat but
00:23:19.440 uh i couldn't see anything without my
00:23:20.880 glasses and i was so nervous that i
00:23:23.039 i just decided take off my glasses and i
00:23:25.840 wouldn't i wouldn't be able to see all
00:23:27.120 those people out there
00:23:32.400 well she had a fantastic voice and
00:23:35.600 and uh she always likes to sing i like
00:23:38.400 to sing too but
00:23:39.679 unfortunately i didn't have the voice
00:23:40.960 she had but uh
00:23:42.880 so she decided in the mid 1970s that
00:23:46.320 she'd like to try and uh do it in front
00:23:50.240 of crowds and it's no fun
00:23:52.080 initially singing in front of crowd but
00:23:53.679 i encourage her to do it and
00:23:55.600 and she started performing uh her
00:23:58.080 locally some
00:23:59.120 and then she also did a little a little
00:24:02.080 bit in
00:24:02.960 in new york my friend bill rowan we
00:24:04.480 started calling him broadway bill
00:24:06.000 because he went around
00:24:07.520 greenwich village and places lined up
00:24:09.520 lined up gigs for
00:24:10.880 uh she was very very good
00:24:18.480 well i like to eat everything that i had
00:24:20.880 at my sixth birthday party i thought
00:24:22.480 that was
00:24:23.200 i thought the menu there was superb you
00:24:24.799 know with hamburgers and hot dogs and
00:24:27.039 and uh coke and
00:24:30.640 uh chocolate sundaes and so
00:24:33.919 i found what agreed to me at a very
00:24:36.640 early age and i've continued now to age
00:24:38.559 85 and it still seems to work
00:24:41.679 i've i've really never eaten
00:24:45.600 i don't see any reason to eat your 40th
00:24:48.640 favorite
00:24:49.520 food when you can eat your favorite food
00:24:51.360 and and uh
00:24:53.039 uh i've really found
00:24:56.640 i've had 500 meals or maybe even
00:25:00.240 thousand dollar meals and i found
00:25:01.679 they're not as good as you know
00:25:03.520 what i can have when i get a good
00:25:05.600 hamburger and some fresh fries and a
00:25:07.360 coke so
00:25:08.400 i i don't see any reason to uh
00:25:11.440 to eat what other people like and i know
00:25:14.559 that if i'd
00:25:15.360 been eating broccoli and spinach and
00:25:17.600 brussels sprouts and
00:25:18.799 asparagus all my life that that i don't
00:25:21.360 think i'd have lived this long i i think
00:25:23.120 that
00:25:23.440 uh i think that it would have seemed
00:25:25.840 like a long time but i uh
00:25:29.120 i think my diet has worked very well for
00:25:30.880 me i'm not advocating it for others but
00:25:33.279 but uh it seemed to work very well for
00:25:35.200 me
00:25:39.200 well my mother had a tough time i mean
00:25:42.480 her mother ended up in a mental hospital
00:25:44.960 and and
00:25:46.159 and she already she carried a lot of the
00:25:48.720 burdens of her family her
00:25:50.720 her brother who she worshiped died very
00:25:53.200 young
00:25:53.760 and and and she was looked at as the
00:25:55.760 mainstay and
00:25:57.279 and uh uh you know she followed my
00:26:01.120 dad obviously to washington she pitched
00:26:03.440 in on everything involving my dad but
00:26:05.360 but uh uh she had
00:26:08.840 uh i'm almost sure that
00:26:11.840 they were migraine she they had a
00:26:13.600 different term in those days for him and
00:26:15.279 and so she
00:26:16.640 she uh she had she carried a lot of the
00:26:19.679 world's burdens
00:26:20.799 on her shoulders and and uh
00:26:24.960 she uh
00:26:28.080 she would she could be difficult
00:26:30.000 sometimes and then she could be
00:26:31.279 wonderful
00:26:31.919 other times but but when she uh when she
00:26:35.200 got difficult
00:26:36.480 the three children felt it she was very
00:26:39.679 very bright and she was very gregarious
00:26:42.080 she was a good campaigner for my dad
00:26:44.240 but but uh
00:26:48.159 she'd gone through a lot of strains i
00:26:49.600 mean she after she
00:26:51.200 graduated from high school she worked
00:26:53.440 for a couple years before
00:26:55.919 to get the funds actually to go to the
00:26:57.679 university of nebraska where she met my
00:26:59.360 dad and
00:27:01.760 i think there was a lot of unhappiness
00:27:04.159 which she never talked about you know in
00:27:06.159 her growing up that
00:27:07.279 uh uh affected uh
00:27:10.320 uh her attitude to some extent and i
00:27:12.480 think
00:27:14.480 they didn't call them my i forget the
00:27:15.679 terms that they used in those days but
00:27:17.600 uh but i think they were migraines and
00:27:20.080 and
00:27:20.960 she was in physical pain a fair amount
00:27:23.120 of the time
00:27:28.159 well he had various nicknames for me
00:27:30.159 he'd call me fireball sometimes and
00:27:32.399 uh it would you know i got very
00:27:34.960 interested in the stock market so
00:27:36.799 uh jesse livermore was a famous stock
00:27:38.720 speculator sometimes he called me that
00:27:40.159 he had he had a lot of different names
00:27:41.600 for me that uh
00:27:42.880 that uh but he probably fireball was the
00:27:47.200 uh number one term i had a lot of energy
00:27:50.720 is
00:27:50.960 you know i i still have a lot of energy
00:27:54.159 when i'm doing something i like and and
00:27:56.080 uh i was
00:27:57.360 i was inquisitive and and uh
00:28:00.640 and i like to talk to grown-ups a lot so
00:28:02.799 anytime his friends came over
00:28:04.240 uh uh or the family's friends uh i would
00:28:07.360 have a great time
00:28:08.320 uh uh talking uh i i usually would talk
00:28:12.159 to the men when they came over but
00:28:13.919 if i was wandering around the
00:28:15.520 neighborhood i'd go in and talk to
00:28:17.120 housewives various places i
00:28:19.279 uh and i had a lot of energy and ideas
00:28:23.360 and you know
00:28:23.840 and i'd start little businesses or
00:28:26.240 something of a sort and
00:28:27.360 and i think he was entertained by it and
00:28:30.320 i think maybe that's where the fireball
00:28:31.760 came from
00:28:36.080 well when i
00:28:39.440 first first books i read on investment
00:28:42.320 were actually in my dad's office
00:28:44.000 i would go down on on saturday to
00:28:47.919 he would have lunch down at johnny's
00:28:49.760 cafe uh
00:28:51.120 with us either one or two partners uh
00:28:55.120 uh at the south all my feed company and
00:28:58.240 so i would i i love to go to those
00:29:00.799 lunches but i get down there early and
00:29:02.240 i'd
00:29:02.480 be reading the books in the office and
00:29:04.559 pretty soon i read all the books in the
00:29:05.840 office so i started
00:29:06.799 going over to the public library and i i
00:29:10.880 i you know i love to just run go to the
00:29:13.279 stacks where the business books were
00:29:14.799 and i read them all uh all the
00:29:16.799 investment books
00:29:18.000 um well before we moved to washington
00:29:20.480 when i was 12
00:29:21.440 and read some of them more than once and
00:29:24.320 uh
00:29:25.360 you know i i basically loved reading and
00:29:28.320 uh
00:29:29.200 the library uh uh we didn't buy books in
00:29:32.240 those days uh
00:29:33.279 the library was uh was a great place for
00:29:37.120 me and i would
00:29:38.000 take the street car down often and go to
00:29:39.679 the ymca and go to the library and
00:29:42.320 and then go home uh around dinner time
00:29:45.279 uh
00:29:46.080 uh i actually got locked into the
00:29:50.159 what was then the university of omaha
00:29:51.760 library one time when i got
00:29:53.360 i got uh terribly enmeshed in
00:29:56.559 in reading in some stacks that were way
00:29:58.559 in the back and they locked the place up
00:30:00.240 and
00:30:00.799 i couldn't get out so i it took me
00:30:03.039 several hours before i could
00:30:04.640 rouse my father-in-law who was a dean
00:30:06.799 there and he got a janitor to
00:30:09.120 finally let me out of the library
00:30:15.520 well when we were in omaha but before i
00:30:17.440 was we moved to washington i would say i
00:30:19.200 was
00:30:19.840 quite gregarious and i was but i was
00:30:21.679 gregarious with adults as well as
00:30:23.840 as kids i was i was certainly shy with
00:30:27.279 girls although
00:30:28.240 that was not unusual in those days but i
00:30:30.799 did
00:30:31.520 i i've always i've i like being with
00:30:34.840 people
00:30:39.919 focus has always been
00:30:43.360 a strong part of my personality if i get
00:30:45.919 interested in something i get really
00:30:47.200 interested
00:30:47.840 and and that was true
00:30:50.960 um about any subject i mean my
00:30:54.320 if i get if i get interested in new
00:30:55.840 subject i want to read about it i want
00:30:57.200 to talk about it and i want to meet
00:30:58.559 people that are
00:30:59.519 involved in it and and uh but that's
00:31:04.080 true of most of my friends i mean
00:31:05.919 charlie munger is a very focused guy
00:31:08.000 that uh for example and and uh uh
00:31:12.480 i don't think i could have done remotely
00:31:15.360 what i've
00:31:15.919 been able to do in business unless i if
00:31:18.720 i hadn't had that
00:31:20.399 really intense focus i mean i i i would
00:31:23.279 go through a 2000 page
00:31:25.600 moody's manual you know page by page at
00:31:28.240 night you know
00:31:29.519 looking at companies and thinking about
00:31:31.519 them and
00:31:34.880 and it it really it paid off
00:31:41.919 my my my two sisters uh uh
00:31:45.360 about equidistant on each side of me a
00:31:47.200 couple years older with doris a couple
00:31:49.279 years younger with birdie and
00:31:50.720 and uh we actually we had a lot of fun
00:31:53.760 together
00:31:54.320 uh uh they you know as they
00:31:57.760 as they grew older that uh you know
00:32:00.960 doris got interested in boys first
00:32:02.640 because she was the oldest and and
00:32:04.320 uh so they were the age difference to
00:32:07.039 some extent
00:32:08.320 affected the relate the precise
00:32:10.880 relationship we had at any time but but
00:32:13.840 but uh i really liked both of my sisters
00:32:18.000 a lot and and uh we were competitive in
00:32:20.799 certain ways uh
00:32:22.000 we used to have spell downs in grade
00:32:24.000 school where you'd have
00:32:25.440 six from each class and you'd go to the
00:32:28.799 next class upward then those 12 would
00:32:32.080 spell words until they're only six
00:32:34.000 remaining and then they would go up to
00:32:35.760 the further class it was always
00:32:37.360 my ambition to move up past doris who
00:32:40.240 was a couple years ahead of me and i'm
00:32:41.679 sure bernie's ambition was to get past
00:32:43.440 me so
00:32:44.480 uh but we you know we had we had fun
00:32:47.279 driving in the cars we had fun singing
00:32:49.360 a whole bunch of different things it was
00:32:51.200 uh i was lucky to have the sisters i had
00:32:57.120 when i was born in 1930 the difference
00:32:59.279 between being a male baby and a female
00:33:01.360 baby was
00:33:02.159 was huge at birth that my sisters
00:33:05.840 are fully as smart as i am uh
00:33:09.120 they've got better personalities than i
00:33:10.960 have certainly they didn't
00:33:12.399 in our younger years particularly and uh
00:33:16.000 no one ever said my dad mother loved us
00:33:19.039 all equally that
00:33:20.159 the teachers took equal interest in it
00:33:23.039 in us but
00:33:24.240 but the expectations were just different
00:33:26.960 because i was a boy and they were girls
00:33:28.960 i mean the
00:33:29.440 the the the thought was for them that
00:33:33.120 you know they should marry well and
00:33:34.720 maybe learn to be a
00:33:36.399 secretary or whatever it might be if
00:33:38.480 they wanted to have some temporary
00:33:39.919 employment before they got married and
00:33:41.279 started having children
00:33:42.240 the expectation with me was that that
00:33:44.640 the sky was the limit and
00:33:46.080 uh it it was just night and day and that
00:33:50.000 that struck me very early on as as
00:33:52.720 really
00:33:53.279 incredibly unfair uh and uh
00:33:56.480 uh and of course i continue to see other
00:33:58.480 examples in my life but the
00:33:59.840 the initial examples really were my
00:34:01.440 sisters i mean here were here were two
00:34:04.080 human beings that uh terrific
00:34:06.720 personalities very bright you know
00:34:09.040 you couldn't have better people and
00:34:12.239 the teachers never said to them you
00:34:13.839 don't have the same opportunities as
00:34:15.440 warren my parents certainly never said
00:34:17.199 anything like that
00:34:18.239 but it was there and it was there
00:34:19.760 throughout the society
00:34:24.639 well in the investment world uh
00:34:28.879 you really if you if you're emotional
00:34:31.760 about investments you're not gonna
00:34:33.119 you're not going to do well i mean facts
00:34:35.679 are facts and reason is reason
00:34:37.520 and and you can develop
00:34:41.280 all these attachments or or
00:34:44.960 or angers or whatever about your stock i
00:34:49.119 mean you may love the ones that go up
00:34:50.560 and hate the ones
00:34:51.520 that that's crazy i mean the stock
00:34:53.599 doesn't know you own it you may have all
00:34:55.119 these feelings about the stock the stock
00:34:56.639 has no feelings about you
00:34:58.240 it's going to reflect what the company
00:34:59.760 behind the stock does so
00:35:01.440 uh our charlie
00:35:05.359 mongers and my investment decisions and
00:35:07.760 our business decisions
00:35:09.280 don't have emotion in them we have
00:35:10.720 plenty of emotions
00:35:12.320 for other situations i mean it's not
00:35:14.320 that we're unemotional about
00:35:15.680 about about the people we care about or
00:35:18.160 anything of the sort
00:35:19.520 but business and investment decisions uh
00:35:24.079 if you get emotions in the equation
00:35:25.760 you're going to do a lot of dumb things
00:35:31.520 i really think that business in america
00:35:35.599 uh obviously the country's developed new
00:35:39.040 products come along and all of that but
00:35:40.480 i
00:35:40.800 i think uh
00:35:44.320 the role of managers really hasn't
00:35:47.280 changed significantly i mean you want
00:35:49.040 people who are leaders you want people
00:35:50.880 who can
00:35:51.920 who can see over the next hill and
00:35:54.560 people are willing to follow them
00:35:56.000 uh you want people that are always
00:35:58.400 dissatisfied
00:36:00.160 uh with the status quo and figure
00:36:02.160 there's a better way of
00:36:03.839 of making that widget or getting to
00:36:05.760 market or whatever it may be
00:36:07.920 uh the market system that this country
00:36:11.040 has enjoyed is
00:36:12.079 is remarkable in terms of unleashing
00:36:14.240 human potential
00:36:15.200 and and it continues to do that
00:36:18.400 decade after decade and that's why in my
00:36:21.760 lifetime alone the real gdp
00:36:24.880 per person in the united states has gone
00:36:26.400 up six for one in one person's lifetime
00:36:28.480 i mean it's
00:36:29.280 when you think of the centuries that in
00:36:32.240 the past where
00:36:33.599 humans at the end of the century were
00:36:35.040 living exactly the same as at the start
00:36:36.880 of the century
00:36:37.920 and then you see the galloping uh
00:36:41.680 uh pace
00:36:45.040 of progress in this country since 1776
00:36:48.160 it
00:36:48.880 it makes you realize we really have
00:36:50.720 found the secret sauce in a market
00:36:52.400 system now there's
00:36:53.680 a lot of things that that also need some
00:36:56.560 tempering in a market system but
00:36:58.400 but it does lead to more and more
00:37:01.839 uh goods and services that people want
00:37:05.520 than than any any other system in the
00:37:08.079 world
00:37:12.800 the nature of an advanced market system
00:37:16.240 is to concentrate greater and greater
00:37:19.920 rewards on the people that
00:37:21.520 happen to be adapted very well to it
00:37:24.640 and to leave a greater and greater
00:37:27.359 distance between them
00:37:29.280 and the people that absolutely are
00:37:31.839 necessary to their success
00:37:34.480 further behind so the gap will widen uh
00:37:38.400 absent taxation or other government
00:37:41.680 policies that that
00:37:43.520 treat the people that do something to
00:37:45.599 emil ameliorate that difference
00:37:48.079 between those who have market skills of
00:37:51.680 enormous value
00:37:53.280 uh you know just an arbitrary juror in
00:37:56.000 new york who makes
00:37:57.359 you know tens of millions of dollars a
00:37:59.119 year spotting little discrepancies in
00:38:00.960 price
00:38:01.680 compared to a soldier in afghanistan you
00:38:03.920 know is getting shot at for
00:38:05.839 for a pittance per month so it
00:38:09.040 it's a wonderful system for turning out
00:38:10.720 the market system is a wonderful system
00:38:12.400 for turning out lots of goods and
00:38:13.680 services
00:38:14.640 uh it's going to distribute them more
00:38:16.640 and more unequally
00:38:18.240 as it progresses it's a natural
00:38:20.000 phenomenon it's not because people are
00:38:21.359 evil or anything of the sort and
00:38:23.040 and so there there have to be has to be
00:38:26.320 some countervailing
00:38:28.320 activities primarily by government to
00:38:31.359 make sure that in an incredibly
00:38:33.119 prosperous society that people who work
00:38:35.119 hard
00:38:35.760 and are good citizens uh don't end up uh
00:38:39.520 uh really being left behind in a true in
00:38:41.920 an abysmal way
00:38:43.359 the philanthropy comes uh
00:38:46.800 from the realization that
00:38:50.000 money that has no utility to me it can't
00:38:52.000 be a buy me one thing i've got
00:38:53.680 everything i want
00:38:54.800 and i could have everything i want with
00:38:56.720 one percent of the net worth i have or
00:38:58.480 even
00:38:58.960 a tenth of one percent of the net worth
00:39:00.480 i have uh on the other hand
00:39:02.960 that money has enormous utility other
00:39:04.560 people it can it can save lives it can
00:39:06.240 educate people it can do all kinds of
00:39:07.920 things so
00:39:08.960 it's silly for me to not
00:39:12.880 transfer that utility over to uh
00:39:17.200 to people who can use it that it's doing
00:39:19.200 me no good
00:39:24.000 well i wouldn't say that i would say the
00:39:26.320 greed
00:39:27.680 has gotten me in trouble i uh
00:39:31.920 i don't i don't think greed is a big
00:39:34.320 part of
00:39:35.599 of investing i mean investing is an
00:39:38.480 attempt to
00:39:39.920 put capital into places that where it's
00:39:41.760 going to
00:39:43.040 produce a very good return and
00:39:46.640 but i think i think usually greed has
00:39:50.480 some aspect of perhaps of nd in it it's
00:39:52.960 the aspiration just to have
00:39:55.119 have money for its own sake uh uh
00:39:58.640 money really doesn't it doesn't do you
00:40:00.960 any good beyond a point so it's
00:40:02.960 it agreed would be sort of an illogical
00:40:06.800 uh pursuit uh uh i want to do
00:40:09.680 intelligent things
00:40:11.040 and i want to do them i'm doing on on my
00:40:13.200 own behalf i'm doing on behalf of the
00:40:14.960 shareholders of berkshire uh i i would
00:40:17.760 not want greedy partners i mean if i've
00:40:19.760 got greedy partners i've got a problem
00:40:21.599 uh i'd like them to go elsewhere i would
00:40:24.160 like people
00:40:25.040 to be my partners who expect a
00:40:26.480 reasonable return from intelligent
00:40:28.560 decisions made over a long period of
00:40:30.400 time
00:40:34.400 i read the omaha world herald i read
00:40:38.560 the new york times the wall street
00:40:40.160 journal the financial times and
00:40:42.079 and i also read usa today uh
00:40:49.280 well probably the the worst
00:40:52.720 the worst mistakes involve not
00:40:55.200 understanding other people as well
00:40:57.440 uh as you might i mean i'm not as smart
00:41:00.960 in a technical sense uh i'm not nearly
00:41:03.599 as smart as i was 50 years ago if you
00:41:05.440 gave me a
00:41:06.560 test involving memory or you know
00:41:09.119 ability to pick up new ideas or do math
00:41:11.040 in my head or whatever it might be i
00:41:12.480 would not score as well
00:41:14.400 uh as i would have when i was 20 or 30.
00:41:17.520 i think i know a lot more about people
00:41:19.280 than i knew when i was 20 or 30 so that
00:41:24.079 i wish i'd known as much about people
00:41:26.079 when i was 20 as i think i know now
00:41:28.079 and would have been helpful in a lot of
00:41:32.839 ways
00:41:34.800 well there are going to be crooks in
00:41:36.319 every society i don't think our society
00:41:38.319 breeds more of them than other societies
00:41:40.079 but they're
00:41:41.119 they're people that for one way or
00:41:42.480 another uh
00:41:44.560 um go down the wrong path and uh they do
00:41:47.839 that in the business world sometimes
00:41:49.280 they do it in the investing world
00:41:50.880 and uh
00:41:54.880 i think that just because of my
00:41:56.880 background
00:41:57.920 sometimes i can spot the people that are
00:42:00.160 doing it in the investing world
00:42:02.720 sooner than the authorities end up
00:42:05.200 catching up with them
00:42:06.880 so there have been times when both
00:42:09.680 charlie munger and i have
00:42:12.240 pointed out certain activities that we
00:42:15.440 think are
00:42:16.480 either distasteful or dishonest or uh
00:42:19.599 and and but that will that's that will
00:42:22.560 be with us forever i mean that
00:42:24.160 there there's big money in investing in
00:42:27.760 finance
00:42:28.480 and business huge money and there are
00:42:31.680 various ways to cheat
00:42:33.119 and people figure out nuances as time
00:42:36.319 goes by and
00:42:37.920 and sometimes the authorities are very
00:42:40.240 slow to catch on to what's going on
00:42:42.240 uh they there tends to be more of that
00:42:45.680 i believe you can't prove it uh
00:42:48.960 during bull markets than than during
00:42:51.839 ordinary markets people's
00:42:53.520 people's morals seem to loosen up as as
00:42:56.960 stocks rise rapidly in price and and
00:42:59.760 there's a feeling that
00:43:01.200 kind of anything goes uh and that the
00:43:03.760 other guy's doing it so why shouldn't i
00:43:05.680 and
00:43:06.240 that was what was going on in the late
00:43:08.079 60s when i wound up my partnership there
00:43:10.240 were a lot of people getting very rich
00:43:12.720 by playing games basically in stocks and
00:43:16.079 i didn't like i didn't like my results
00:43:19.040 being compared with their results
00:43:21.040 they were going to beat me in the game
00:43:23.040 and uh
00:43:24.079 and then i didn't want to do what they
00:43:25.440 were doing so uh that's one
00:43:28.079 major reason i wound up the partnership
00:43:30.480 the first time we had our meeting of the
00:43:32.000 graham group
00:43:33.119 was in 1968 and when the 11 of us met
00:43:37.040 with ben graham you know basically we
00:43:38.640 were saying to ben
00:43:39.760 how long can this go on because there
00:43:41.280 are all kinds of games being played on
00:43:42.880 wall street and
00:43:44.240 and the press applauded them and
00:43:46.079 investors applauded them and these
00:43:47.680 people were becoming heroes and
00:43:49.040 basically they were you know they were
00:43:51.359 they were engaged in creating mirages
00:43:54.160 with accounting
00:43:55.520 and uh ben said it could go on a long
00:43:57.920 time but it'll come to an end eventually
00:43:59.440 and of course that's what happened
00:44:05.440 it has to be there honesty is uh
00:44:09.599 you know first of all i have to be
00:44:10.720 honest with our shareholders i've got
00:44:14.000 i think over a million shareholders of
00:44:15.520 berkshire hathaway they're my partners
00:44:17.359 and they have entrusted me with the
00:44:19.760 money and
00:44:20.560 and it's one reason in the annual report
00:44:22.880 i try and tell them about
00:44:24.640 mistakes i've made as well as you know i
00:44:26.960 believe it's an annual report not an
00:44:28.640 annual sales document
00:44:30.319 uh and i it's a lot easier than as
00:44:34.560 charlie says and you know
00:44:36.400 you don't have to remember what you said
00:44:37.760 if you have here if you're really saying
00:44:39.839 what's the truth as you go along
00:44:45.920 when i'm no longer around uh
00:44:50.079 berkshire's culture is so deep
00:44:53.200 and some i wouldn't call it unique but
00:44:55.119 it's certainly special
00:44:56.560 uh uh and it it permeates
00:45:00.560 our board of directors it permeates our
00:45:02.319 shareholders base that permeates our
00:45:03.839 manage managers so
00:45:06.160 i think it would be very difficult
00:45:09.280 to come in and change the culture in any
00:45:11.359 major way i think that that it would
00:45:13.440 be rejected like a like a foreign
00:45:16.480 object uh uh so i i think
00:45:20.560 uh we're so big that we can't have
00:45:23.520 percentage results anything like we've
00:45:25.359 had in the past
00:45:26.480 but we can be a very decent business and
00:45:28.319 i think it can go on
00:45:30.480 uh for a very very long time without
00:45:33.200 changing its
00:45:34.160 its character uh the sums involved will
00:45:37.920 get larger as it goes along but
00:45:40.319 the basic principles around berkshire
00:45:42.319 it's one of the reasons i stick them in
00:45:43.680 the back of the annual report i've
00:45:45.040 written the principles of
00:45:47.119 of the economic principles of berkshire
00:45:49.760 i've put in the annual report for 35
00:45:51.440 years or so nobody else does that in
00:45:53.119 their reports but
00:45:54.319 those are that's the way we look at
00:45:57.359 at the company and we want our partners
00:45:59.040 to understand that and
00:46:00.880 and i'm not only boxing myself in when i
00:46:03.520 put those in i'm sort of boxing
00:46:05.040 my successor to and to some extent
00:46:08.240 i try to write in the annual report
00:46:10.319 certain things that
00:46:11.680 will box in my successors to some degree
00:46:14.000 but uh
00:46:15.040 because berkshire berkshire has to
00:46:18.560 have to fit it has to be a certain kind
00:46:20.400 of structure and operation
00:46:22.480 uh over the years and i've had 50 years
00:46:26.480 plus to uh to build that structure and i
00:46:30.560 i think that uh i'm sure
00:46:33.599 uh virtually that my successor or
00:46:36.960 more than one will will follow the same
00:46:39.680 general path they'll do things
00:46:40.880 differently obviously
00:46:42.160 but they will do things differently in
00:46:44.319 terms of our
00:46:45.280 the basic tenets of the business
00:46:50.560 i've been very lucky in family i've been
00:46:52.160 i've been lucky and been lucky and
00:46:54.480 didn't want to you know i've been lucky
00:46:55.760 in geography i mean
00:46:58.400 i've been lucky in the time when i was
00:47:00.160 born i mean
00:47:02.160 it would not have been as much fun being
00:47:03.520 born 200 years ago i think about that
00:47:05.200 every time i go to the dentist
00:47:08.319 it's a different world now than that i
00:47:10.319 mean just think of childbirth you know a
00:47:11.839 few hundred years ago or something of
00:47:13.119 the sort
00:47:13.680 and we are very lucky that
00:47:16.720 uh you know at least i consider myself
00:47:19.280 very lucky i was born in 1930 rather
00:47:21.119 than 1730. there's an enormous amount of
00:47:23.200 life
00:47:23.520 how you're wired you know whether i was
00:47:26.559 born female or male 1 was whether i was
00:47:28.319 born black or white i mean it was
00:47:30.240 i mean that was huge you know in
00:47:33.359 in 1930 it's still big but it was it
00:47:36.800 was night and day in terms of the
00:47:38.640 opportunity i was going to have if
00:47:40.880 i've been born black and i would not
00:47:43.040 have
00:47:44.240 you know who knows where i would have
00:47:45.599 ended up but i would certainly would
00:47:46.640 have been you know i would have had a
00:47:47.920 whole different life
00:47:49.040 that had nothing to do with me
