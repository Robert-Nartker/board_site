00:04:11.560 good night
00:04:17.889 testing 1 million two million three okay
00:04:24.970 I I came from Nebraska today and thatyou're probably all familiar with us
00:04:30.400 mainly by our football team we havethose fellows with the the bingo white
00:04:37.570 helmets with those red hands on
00:04:40.390 I asked one of our starters the otherday what's the end stand when he said
00:04:44.110 knowledge
00:04:47.639 ok we can make a ton of though I meanthat you know coaster Nebraska
00:04:52.439 just because you're a football playerwith that they made your in agricultural
00:04:55.379 economics and there's a to questionfinal for all of the fires and first
00:05:02.159 question is what are all mcdonald haveand
00:05:07.440 they were giving that to one of ourpotential Heisman Trophy winners the
00:05:12.060 other day and he started this sweptfinally right now is a farm pressure in
00:05:19.650 the light of course you don't want tofind a Heisman candidate uh so I said
00:05:24.060 now he said you're halfway home
00:05:25.320 he said just one more question how doyou spell far
00:05:29.640 I think I really starts to sweat and helooks at the ceiling and he looks around
00:05:34.860 five his face by itself
00:05:37.590 he says he I all so much for that guysure it will be done right now
00:05:44.100 I look I really want to talk about whatside your mind so we're going to do a
00:05:49.350 Q&A and the men and I I there's a couplequestions i always get asked you know I
00:05:55.560 always did always say well we should igo to work for when i get out then I've
00:06:00.030 got a very simple answer we we mayelaborate more on this as we go along
00:06:03.150 but another the real thing to do is toget going in first
00:06:08.850 some institution or individual that youadmire
00:06:12.360 I mean it's crazy to take in betweenjobs just because they look good on your
00:06:17.220 resume or because you get a littlehigher starting pay i was up at Harvard
00:06:20.700 while back and very nice young guys pickme up at the airport
00:06:25.380 Harvard Business School attending and hesaid look he said I went to undergrad
00:06:29.850 here and then I worked for x and y and zand now I've come here and he said I
00:06:35.760 thought it would really round up myresume perfectly if I want to work now
00:06:41.130 for a big management consulting firm andI said what is that what you want to do
00:06:45.810 he said nobody said that's the perfectresume and I said well what are you
00:06:50.130 going to start doing what you like andhe said well I'll get to that someday
00:06:52.860 and I said well you know I said yourplan sounds to me a lot like saving up
00:06:56.580 sex for your old age
00:06:59.870 it just doesn't make a lot of sex
00:07:02.490 head I told that same girl I said you'renot going to work for every admire the
00:07:06.240 most and I said you can't get a badresult of jump out of bed in the morning
00:07:09.330 and you'll be having fun being called meup a couple weeks later said what you
00:07:14.340 tell us gets he said they're allbecoming self-employed so you've got
00:07:19.590 you've got a temper that advice a littlebit
00:07:21.840 ah play one game a little bit with mefor just a minute and then roll up that
00:07:26.400 will get to your questions and I'd likefor the moment to have you a lot that
00:07:35.159 heavy pretend i made you a great offerand I've told you that you could pick
00:07:41.280 any one of your classmates in you nowknow each other
00:07:44.159 probably pretty well after being herefor a while you can thank you have 24
00:07:47.669 hours to think it over and you can pickany one of your classmates and you get
00:07:51.479 ten percent of their earnings for therest of their lives and I ask you what
00:07:58.889 goes through your mind in determiningwhich one of those who would pick you
00:08:06.180 can pick the one with the richest fatherthat doesn't count on me you gotta gotta
00:08:09.539 do this on merit but you probablywouldn't pick the person against the
00:08:14.969 highest grades in the class
00:08:16.560 I mean that at all we're getting isgrades in the class but that that's not
00:08:20.520 that isn't going to be the quality thatbut that sets apart a big winner from
00:08:28.889 the rest of the pack
00:08:30.240 think about who we would pick and whyand I think you'll find when you get
00:08:34.649 through
00:08:35.429 you'll pick some individual you've allgot the ability you wouldn't be here
00:08:39.630 otherwise you've all got the energy
00:08:41.578 I mean you've got it out here did theinitiative is here
00:08:45.329 the intelligence is here throughout theclass but some of your going to be
00:08:50.399 bigger winners and others had it getsdown to a bunch of qualities that
00:08:57.600 interestingly enough you are our selfmade
00:09:01.980 I mean it's not how tall you are notwilling to kick a football 60 yards is
00:09:05.190 not whether you could run thehundred-yard dash
00:09:07.070 ten seconds it's that whether thebest-looking person in the room
00:09:10.580 it's a whole bunch of qualities thatreally come out of Ben Franklin or the
00:09:15.200 Boy Scout colder so whatever it may be Imean it'sit's its integrity is honesty
00:09:20.390 it's its generosity it's it's beingwilling to do more than your share its
00:09:25.040 it's just all those qualities that areself selected and then if you look on
00:09:30.830 the other side of the ledger becausethere's always a catch to these you know
00:09:34.100 free gifts in June a joke so you'll alsohave to this is the fun part
00:09:39.350 you also have to sell short one of yourclassmates and pay ten percent of what
00:09:43.670 they do
00:09:44.300 so what do you think is going to do theworst in the class is a great more fun
00:09:47.390 and think about it again and again itwasn't the plan but it isn't the person
00:09:51.380 with the lowest grades or anything ofthe sort
00:09:54.440 it's the person who just doesn't shapeup in the character department when we
00:09:58.970 look for three things when we hirepeople we look for intelligence we look
00:10:02.960 friend for initiative or energy and welook for integrity and if they don't
00:10:08.450 have the ladder
00:10:09.500 the first tool kill you because ifyou're going to get somebody without
00:10:12.470 integrity you want to be lazy and down
00:10:15.470 I mean you don't want to get a lot ofsmart and energetic self is that third
00:10:21.110 quality and but everything about thatquality is your choice
00:10:24.200 you know you you can't change the wayyou are wired much but you can change a
00:10:28.580 lot of what you do with that wiring andit's the habits that you generate now on
00:10:33.320 those qualities or those negativequalities i mean the person the person
00:10:37.220 who always you know claimed credit forthings they didn't do that always cuts
00:10:41.990 corners that the can't count on gettingit in the end
00:10:45.830 those those are habit patterns and thetime to form the right habits is one
00:10:49.370 year when you're your age I mean it duh
00:10:52.940 it doesn't do me much good to get golflessons now if I got the golf lessons
00:10:56.720 when I was your age I might be a decentoffer but but it
00:11:00.290 someone once said the chains of habit ortwo are too light to be felt until
00:11:05.420 they're too heavy to be broken and i seethat all the time i see people with have
00:11:09.110 a patterns that
00:11:09.830 her self destructive when they're 50 or60 and they think they really can't
00:11:14.000 change their imprisoned by that butyou're not in prison by anything so when
00:11:18.860 you write down the qualities of thatperson that you'd like to buy to ten
00:11:22.550 percent of look at that list and askyourself is there anything on that list
00:11:27.350 i couldn't do the answers
00:11:29.510 there are there won't be and when youlook at the person yourself short
00:11:33.560 and you look at those qualities that youdon't like if you see any of those in
00:11:37.340 yourself
00:11:38.630 he could tell them whatever maybeselfishness you can get rid of that I
00:11:43.040 mean that is not ordained and if youfollow that you and Ben Franklin did
00:11:50.180 this in my old boss Ben Graham did thisof early ages in their young teens they
00:11:53.540 just been grand looked around and hesaid who I admire you know and you want
00:11:58.670 to be admired himself and he said youknow why do i buy these other people and
00:12:02.480 he said if I admire them for thesereasons maybe other people will admire
00:12:05.000 me if I behave in a similar manner anyand he decided what kind of a person who
00:12:08.810 wanted to be and if you follow that atthe end you'll be the person you love my
00:12:14.240 ten percent of I mean that's the goal inthe end and it's it's something that's
00:12:18.440 achievable by by everybody in this roomso that's the end of the sermon
00:12:21.830 knowledge let's talk about what's onyour mind and the you're going to ask
00:12:26.270 anything
00:12:27.020 the only thing I won't tell you is whatwe're buying or selling her about let's
00:12:31.880 say yeah i don't i don't even tellmyself that I mean I i write it down
00:12:34.820 that I like the coca-cola formula youknow there's only two people can get
00:12:38.510 into the trust Department and find outwhat they are and I don't know the two
00:12:41.630 are so it at its we don't talk aboutwhat we're buying or selling but
00:12:46.490 anything else is fair game personalbusiness
00:12:49.010 anything you'd like to talk about andactually the top of the questions are
00:12:52.820 the more interesting of this for me sodon't don't spare my feelings i may just
00:12:56.840 thrown at my head
00:12:58.150 add that and with that let's I guess wegot a microphone is this the only
00:13:02.200 microphone is there one on feeling likeok here is my ceiling
00:13:06.460 I'm gonna do microphone to stand in linethem and i'll be Regis Philbin and you
00:13:11.740 can
00:13:12.460 yes i have an old-fashioned belief thati can only should expect to make money
00:13:20.080 and things that I understand when I sayunderstand I don't understand it
00:13:24.430 you know what the product does oranything like that
00:13:27.790 I didn't understand what the economicsof the business are likely to look at
00:13:31.930 look like 10 years in our 20 years andnow i know in general what the economics
00:13:38.440 of a Wrigley chewing gum will look like10 years now
00:13:41.470 the internet is going to change the waypeople should come
00:13:44.950 it isn't going to change which come theytrue now if you own the chewing gum
00:13:49.840 market in a big way and you've gotdouble mint experiment and juicy fruit
00:13:55.240 those brands will be there 10 yearsanalysis
00:13:58.450 I can't pinpoint exactly what thenumbers are gonna look like I'm really
00:14:02.230 but i'm not going to be way off if I tryto look forward on something like that
00:14:05.410 that evaluating that company is withinwhen i call my circle of competence I
00:14:09.970 understand what they do i understand theeconomics of and I understand the
00:14:14.230 competitive aspects of the business
00:14:16.690 there can be all kinds of companies thathave wonderful futures but i don't know
00:14:22.930 which ones they are
00:14:24.070 and I given talks in the past where Icarry with me a a 70-page tightly
00:14:31.180 printed list and it shows two thousandauto companies now for the start of the
00:14:37.750 20th century you had seen what the autowas going to do to this country the
00:14:42.670 impact it would have on the lives andthen your children and grandchildren and
00:14:47.170 so on that what it just it transformedthe American landscape but of those two
00:14:52.840 thousand companies you know threebasically survive and they haven't done
00:14:58.000 that well I had many times
00:15:00.350 so how do you pick three winners out of2,000 I mean it's not so easy to do it's
00:15:06.020 easy when you look back but it's not soeasy looking forward so you could have
00:15:09.140 been dead right on on the fact that theauto industry fact he probably could
00:15:15.140 have predicted how big impact it wouldhave but you wouldn't have if you want
00:15:19.700 companies across the board you wouldn'thave made any money because the economic
00:15:23.120 characteristics of that business we'renot easy to define i said i'd always
00:15:28.520 said the easier thing to do is figureout who loses and what you really should
00:15:32.780 have done in 1900 five or so when yousaw what was going to happen with the
00:15:37.520 auto is you should have gone shorthorses there were 20 million horses and
00:15:41.270 1900 there's about four million horsesnow so it's easy to figure out the
00:15:44.480 losers get the losers the horse but thewinner was the auto overall but 2,000
00:15:51.980 companies just about fail with youmerged out and so on
00:15:55.370 there were three companies autocompanies in the Dow Industrials in the
00:16:02.120 nineteen twenties and thirtiesStudebaker Nash Combinator and Hudson
00:16:07.070 motor those names are all familiar to meand maybe some more familiar to you
00:16:11.780 but they're not making any cars you knowthey didn't make money i had at one time
00:16:15.500 they were in the dowel 30
00:16:18.020 they were the aristocrats of Americanbusiness and they got creamed
00:16:23.120 so figuring out the economiccharacteristics about the winners in a
00:16:28.010 wonderful business and it is not easy innorth carolina in a horrible and Roberto
00:16:32.840 golf
00:16:33.440 I guess or we'll talk often we'rewatching i have been Wilbur
00:16:37.490 but if you could have seen the future ofthe airline business from that point
00:16:43.100 forward and how that would transformthings you know it would blow you away
00:16:47.149 that's excited people incidentally eversince
00:16:49.670 but if they're going to capitalist thekitty hawk he should have shot horrible
00:16:53.450 down
00:16:54.080 I mean it because it's nothing but costinvestors money there were 400 airplane
00:17:00.440 companies in the nineteen twenties andthirties along there was an all the hall
00:17:03.470 there was a Nebraska we were the siliconvalley of America apparently very graft
00:17:07.459 and they all disappeared in a terriblebusiness at the end of nineteen
00:17:13.010 ninety-one if you added up the aggregateearnings from all airline companies with
00:17:17.809 billions board in since Wilbur andOrville were down there
00:17:21.589 they came to less than zero number ofpassengers went up every year the
00:17:27.140 importance of the industry wasdramatically increased decade by decade
00:17:31.309 and nobody made any money
00:17:34.250 it so figuring out the economicconsequences TV
00:17:40.580 I think there's I don't know 20 25million sensei years old the United
00:17:43.610 States
00:17:44.390 I don't think is one of them made in theUnited States anymore I mean it's a TV
00:17:47.840 set manufacturer what a wonderfulbusiness site
00:17:50.210 everybody and nobody a TV in nineteenfifty are there about 45 to 50
00:17:56.150 everybody has multiple sets now nobodyis in the United States and made any
00:18:00.679 real money making the sense that they'reall out of business in the magnet boxes
00:18:04.700 the rca's all of those companies radiowas the equivalent of 20 over 500
00:18:09.170 companies making radios in nineteentwenties again I don't think there's a
00:18:12.440 us radio manufacturer at the presenttime but coca-cola
00:18:17.179 you know I was eighteen eighty forjacob's pharmacy or whatever and fellow
00:18:21.110 comes up with something a lot of cockcopiers over the years but now you've
00:18:25.910 got a company that is selling roughly1.1 billion a tout servings of its
00:18:32.510 product not all cloaks writing someother daily throughout the world
00:18:36.890 honoured 17 years later so understandingthe economic characteristics of a
00:18:42.950 business is different than predictingthe fact that an interest
00:18:46.330 is going to do wonderfully so I look atthe internet businesses are looking at
00:18:52.419 tech mrs. i say this is a marvelousthing I love to play around on the
00:18:55.899 computer and it now i order my booksfrom amazon and all kinds of things but
00:19:00.190 I don't know who's going to win unless Iknow who's going to win
00:19:03.460 I'm not interested in the best thingi'll just play around on the computer at
00:19:06.640 defining your circle of competence isthe most important aspect of investing
00:19:14.110 it's not how important how large yourcircle is you don't have to be an expert
00:19:18.880 on everything but knowing where theperimeter of that circle of what you
00:19:23.260 know what you don't know is and stayinginside of it is all important
00:19:28.149 Tom Watson senior started IBM said inhis book he said it
00:19:33.309 I'm no genius said but I'm smart inspots
00:19:36.730 I stay around those spots and you knowthat is the key
00:19:40.090 so if I understand a few things and Istick in that arena
00:19:45.010 I'll do okay and if I don't understandsomething but I got all excited about it
00:19:48.940 because my neighbors are talking aboutstocks are going up everything they
00:19:52.179 start fooling around someplace else
00:19:53.769 eventually I'll get cream and I shouldso now let's go over here a little bit
00:19:59.440 I got two short questions one is how doyou find intrinsic value in a company
00:20:04.720 while intrinsic value is what is thenumber that if you were all knowing
00:20:11.649 about the future and could predict allthe cash that a bit of business would
00:20:16.149 give you between now and judgement day
00:20:18.490 discounted at the proper discount ratethat number is what the intrinsic value
00:20:24.490 of businesses in other words the onlyreason for making investment laying out
00:20:29.080 money now is to get more money later onright that's that's what investing is
00:20:32.350 all about
00:20:33.159 now when you look at the stock when youlook at the bottom so Miss United States
00:20:37.630 government is very easy tom what you'regoing to get back
00:20:39.909 it says it right on the bond it sayswhen you get the interest payments so
00:20:43.240 when you get the principal
00:20:44.529 so it's very easy to figure out thevalue of a body could change tomorrow of
00:20:48.460 interest rates change but you are thecash flows are printed on the bond the
00:20:54.220 cash flows are printed on a stockcertificate
00:20:56.740 that's the job of the animals
00:20:58.169 is to print out change that stockcertificate which represents an interest
00:21:03.330 in the business and change that into abond and say this is what I think it's
00:21:07.619 going to play out in the future when webuy you know some machine for Shaw it to
00:21:13.950 make carpet
00:21:14.820 that's what we're thinking aboutobviously and you know you all learned
00:21:17.100 that in business school but it's thesame thing for a big business it if you
00:21:21.029 by coca-cola today the company isselling for about a hundred and ten to
00:21:25.769 fifteen billion dollars in the marketthe question is if you had a hundred and
00:21:29.399 ten or fifteen billion you would belistening to me but I didn't listen to
00:21:33.629 you it's nothing but the question iswould you lay it out today to get what
00:21:39.989 the coca-cola company is going todeliver to you over the next two or
00:21:43.769 three hundred years
00:21:44.730 discount rate doesn't make muchdifference after as you get further out
00:21:47.669 but and that is a question how much cashthey are going to give you it isn't a
00:21:51.299 question of you know that is thequestion of how many analysts are going
00:21:54.690 to recommend that or what the volume ofthe stock is or what the chart looks
00:21:58.049 like running
00:21:58.889 it's a question how much cash is goingto give you that you only read the true
00:22:01.919 with if you're buying a farm
00:22:03.389 if you're buying an apartment houseany financial asset for oil in the
00:22:07.950 ground
00:22:08.789 you're laying out Cashin how to get yourcash back later on and the question is
00:22:12.269 how much you're going to get one here toget it and how sure are you
00:22:16.980 and when i calculate intrinsic value ofa business when we buy businesses and
00:22:23.580 whether we're buying all of a businessor a little piece of the business i
00:22:26.429 always think we're buying the wholebusiness because that's my approach to
00:22:29.249 it
00:22:29.820 I look at it and say what what will comeout of this business and when and what
00:22:36.419 you really like of course of them to beable to use the money they earn and are
00:22:40.350 higher returns on it as you go along Imean Berkshires never distributed
00:22:43.889 anything to shareholders but its abilityto distribute goes up as the value of
00:22:48.629 the businesses we own increases we cancompound it internally but the real
00:22:53.249 question
00:22:53.929 berkshire selling for will say a hundredand five or so billion now uh what can
00:23:01.340 we distribute from that hundred and ifyou're going to buy the whole company
00:23:04.940 405 million now can we distribute enoughcash to you soon enough to make a
00:23:11.960 sensible
00:23:12.679 at present interest rates to lay outthat cash now and that's that's what he
00:23:16.610 gets out doing at the end if you can'tanswer that question
00:23:19.190 you can't buy the stock you know you cangamble in the stock if you want to your
00:23:23.960 neighbors can buy it but if you don'tanswer that question I can't answer that
00:23:27.080 for for internet companies for examplethat a lot of companies that all kinds
00:23:31.279 of me so I can ask for but I just stayaway from those number two
00:23:34.999 so you get formula is involved infinding intrinsic values and
00:23:38.240 circumference and you got a mathematicalthis is that just got a present value of
00:23:42.230 future cash show segments for questionis why haven't you written down your set
00:23:49.249 of formulas or your strategies inwritten form so you can share with
00:23:53.629 everyone else
00:23:54.470 well i think i actually have writtenabout that oh and if you read the annual
00:23:57.499 reports over the years back the mostrecent and report
00:24:00.919 I i use what I've just been talking touse the illustration of Esau because
00:24:05.840 here he stopped was in 600 BC smart manwas smart enough to know it was 600 BC
00:24:12.080 though I mean it will take a littleforesight that but he stopped you know
00:24:18.379 it between tortoises and hair is alwaysother things he found time to write
00:24:21.529 about you know Bert and he said a birdin the hand is worth two in the bush
00:24:26.240 now there isn't quite complete becausethe question is how sure are you that
00:24:31.820 there are two in the bush
00:24:33.139 and how long you have to wait to getthem out now
00:24:36.809 they probably knew that but he justdidn't have time because he had all
00:24:39.929 these other problems to write and had toget on with it so but he was halfway
00:24:44.879 there and 600 BC that's all there is toinvesting is how many birds in the bush
00:24:51.090 what are you going to get them out andhow sure are you
00:24:54.299 now if interest rates are fifteenpercent roughly
00:24:59.850 you've got to get two birds out of thebush and five years equal the bird in
00:25:03.090 the hand but if interest rates are threepercent and you can get two birds out in
00:25:07.860 20 years it still makes sense to give upthe bird in the hand because it's all
00:25:12.629 gets back to discounting against aninterest on interest rate that Hamish
00:25:17.399 often you don't know you know not onlyhow many birds in the bush put in the
00:25:21.720 case the Internet companies thereweren't any birds in the bush but that
00:25:25.730 but they still take the bird that yougive them from the hand that but it's
00:25:29.320 but I i actually have written about thissort of thing and stealing have away
00:25:33.549 from the top of the rotor some 2,600years ago but I've been behind on my
00:25:38.440 reading
00:25:38.860 yeah yeah good morning huh I know you'revain for your success but i was curious
00:25:43.539 is there any particular moments in yourlife that or mistakes or failures that
00:25:48.490 you've made that were particularlymemorable
00:25:50.649 what you may have learned from them andif you have any particular advice for
00:25:53.529 the students here in dealing with thewith the discouraging circle yeah I well
00:25:59.620 I may have made a lot of mistakesbiggest mistake i exalt while and not
00:26:02.559 the biggest not necessarily the biggestbut the by Berkshire Hathaway itself was
00:26:06.039 a mistake because virtually lousytextile business and I brought a very
00:26:10.450 cheap
00:26:11.679 I've been taught by Ben Graham to buythings on a quantitative basis look
00:26:16.750 around for things that are cheap andthat i was taught that same 1949-50 made
00:26:23.590 a big impression on me so I went aroundlooking for what i call you cigar bunch
00:26:29.139 of stocks and the cigar butt approach tobuying stocks is that you walk down the
00:26:33.789 street and you're looking around forcigar butts and you find this
00:26:37.120 honestly that's terrible-looking soggyugly-looking cigar one pot left in it
00:26:43.149 but you pick it up and you get your onepuff disgusting is right away but it's
00:26:47.409 free
00:26:47.980 I mean it's cheap and then you lookaround for another soggy
00:26:51.190 you know one puff cigarettes well that'swhat I did for years
00:26:54.279 it's a mistake ah although we make moneydoing it but you can't make it with big
00:26:59.259 money so much easier just to bywonderful businesses so now i would
00:27:02.740 rather buy a wonderful business at afair price that a fair business with a
00:27:06.340 wonderful price but in those days I wasbuying cheap stocks and berkshire was
00:27:10.570 selling below its working capital forsure you have plans for nothing at the
00:27:13.570 machinery for nothing
00:27:14.710 you get the inventory and receivables ofthe discount is cheap so i bought it and
00:27:19.539 twenty years later I was still running alousy business and that money did not
00:27:24.610 compound you really want to be awonderful business because at that time
00:27:28.090 is the friend of the wonderful businessyou keep compounding it keeps doing more
00:27:31.690 business and you keep making more moneytime is the enemy of the lousy business
00:27:36.940 I could have sold berkshire perhapsliquidated it and made a quick little
00:27:40.600 profit
00:27:41.529 you know one puff but staying with thosekind of businesses is this is a big
00:27:46.149 mistake
00:27:46.929 so you might say I learned something outof that mistake and I would have been
00:27:51.399 way better off taking what i did withBerkshires I kept buying but better
00:27:55.809 businesses
00:27:56.590 I started insurance business sees candythe Buffalo and all kinds of things i
00:28:00.220 would have been way better doing thatwith a with a brand-new little entity
00:28:04.840 that I'd set up rather than usingberkshire the platform now I've had a
00:28:08.409 lot of fun out of it
00:28:09.519 I mean everything in life seems to turnout for the better so I I don't have any
00:28:12.669 complaints about that but it was a dumbthing to do
00:28:15.490 I went in the US air i bought apreferred stock in 1989
00:28:21.250 ah as soon as my check cleared thecompany went into the red never got out
00:28:26.379 I mean it was it that really done
00:28:28.450 I mean a dead I've got an 800 number icall now whenever I think about buying
00:28:33.250 an airline stock i call them up any ourthat fortunately i call it three in the
00:28:37.240 morning and I just dial it myself myname is Warren I'm a narrow holic and
00:28:40.779 I'm thinking about buying this thing andthen they talked me down many things
00:28:44.019 happened
00:28:44.590 thanks takes hours sometimes but it'sworth it
00:28:47.740 flipping if you ever think about thatera of buying an airline stock call me
00:28:51.520 and i'll give you the 800 number becauseI don't know
00:28:53.750 you don't want to do it but we got luckyin terms of how we eventually came out
00:28:59.930 on it but it was a dumb dumb decision
00:29:03.410 all mine and I've done
00:29:06.590 I biggest biggest step in terms ofevents that in terms of opportunity
00:29:12.320 cause eventually cost
00:29:13.520 I brought half interest in a Sinclairfilling station was about 20 with a guy
00:29:18.530 was in the national guard with out of myten thousand dollars then I put two
00:29:21.920 thousand dollars in and I lost it all
00:29:24.530 so that was twenty percent and thatmeans that the opportunity cost is now
00:29:29.210 six billion dollars of that of thatfilling station which is a big price to
00:29:33.950 pay for you know getting the white withyour windows in the fields Hannah
00:29:37.430 windshields and things like that so
00:29:39.830 actually I like it when berkshire goesdown does it reduce the cost of that
00:29:42.530 mistake on an opportunity to us but thebiggest mistakes we made by far I've
00:29:49.820 made not we've made the biggest mistakesI've made by far our mistakes of
00:29:56.060 omission and not coalition me it's thethings I knew enough to do they were
00:30:01.400 within my circle of competence and I wassucking my thumb and that is really
00:30:06.620 those are the ones that her they don'tshow up any place I probably cost
00:30:10.550 berkshire at least five billion dollarsfor example by sucking my thumb
00:30:15.680 twenty years ago are close to one FannieMae was was having some troubles and
00:30:19.670 forget about the whole company forpractically nothing and I don't worry
00:30:24.740 about that if it's microsoft because Idon't know what was microsoft isn't in
00:30:27.890 my circle of compliments
00:30:29.030 that's why I I don't have any reason tothink I'm entitled to make money out of
00:30:32.900 Microsoft or out of cocoa beans orwhatever but I didn't know enough to
00:30:37.550 understand Fannie Mae and I bullet andthat never shows up under conventional
00:30:41.570 county but the call i know the cost ofit I know I know you know that I passed
00:30:46.730 it up
00:30:47.240 and those are the big big mistakes and
00:30:50.690 I've had plenty of them at and youunless I tell you about them in the
00:30:56.360 annual report and I resist thetemptation sometimes as I tell you about
00:31:01.250 him in the annual report
00:31:02.510 you're not going to know it because itdoesn't show up under conventional
00:31:04.250 county but automation is way bigger thanaccomplished there is a big
00:31:09.200 opportunities in life have to be seizedout we don't do very many things but
00:31:14.120 when we get the chance to do somethingthat's right a big
00:31:16.700 we've got to do it and even to do it ona small scale is just as big a mistake
00:31:20.900 almost is not doing it at all I meanyou've really gotta you gotta grab them
00:31:24.350 when they come and that because they arenot going to get 500 great opportunities
00:31:28.460 you would be better off if when you gotout of school here
00:31:31.910 you gotta punch card with 20 punches onit and every big financial every
00:31:37.250 financial decision you made you used upa punch you get very rich because you
00:31:41.510 think through very hard
00:31:43.520 each one of you want to a cocktail partyand somebody talk about a company didn't
00:31:46.580 even understand what they did hecouldn't pronounce the name but they
00:31:49.670 made some money last week and anotherone like it
00:31:52.100 you wouldn't buy it if you only had 24inches on that card there's a temptation
00:31:55.220 to dabble
00:31:56.870 if particularly during all markets insocks is so easy you know easier now
00:32:02.810 than ever because you can do it online
00:32:04.700 you know just you click it then andmaybe goes up to . get excited about
00:32:07.970 that you buy another one the next dayand so on
00:32:09.920 you can't make any money over time doingthat but if you have a punch card with
00:32:13.820 only 20 punches
00:32:15.140 we're going to get another one of us toyour life you would think a long time
00:32:18.440 before every investment decision and youwould make good ones and you make big
00:32:23.090 ones and you probably wouldn't even useall 20 punches at the in your lifetime
00:32:27.710 but you would need to
00:32:28.760 yeah mr. perfect morning and in yourcomments about making mistakes and
00:32:34.070 errors like that you talk a little aboutyour self discipline when you're in a
00:32:37.190 position and you you feel like it's nolonger good in what criteria to use to
00:32:41.450 you just finally abandoned it
00:32:43.070 yeah when I started out the Southsituation has changed over the years
00:32:47.300 because when i started out and why ideasthe money and i would go through movies
00:32:53.870 manual i went through it page by pageand then I went through it again
00:32:57.380 by page and i found stocks in there thati could understand that we're selling a
00:33:01.640 bike to time journeys even one timeservings
00:33:04.160 well when you don't have 10,000 bucksthat i can get a little frustrating and
00:33:08.030 and if you don't like to borrow moneywhich I never like to borrow money so I
00:33:12.350 was always coming up with more ideasthan i had money so i had to sell
00:33:15.860 whatever I likes least to buy somethingnew that just was compelling to me and
00:33:20.510 it for a long time i was in that modeand now our problems we have more money
00:33:25.970 than ideas
00:33:27.530 so where when
00:33:30.530 if you look at our annual report whichis on the internet under in our home
00:33:35.480 base furniture out of the way . com
00:33:37.040 you'll see something in the back callthe economic principles of Berkshire and
00:33:41.540 you will see which I believe in settingout for my my partner's they are my
00:33:45.830 partner's I don't look at my share of mypartners and I got my partners for life
00:33:49.850 so I want to tell them how I think andif they don't just agree with the way I
00:33:54.350 think that's fine but I don't want themthat I don't be disappointed in me
00:33:58.100 so ah i lay out there and I say in termsof are wholly owned businesses
00:34:03.890 we're not going to sell no matter howmuch anybody offers this for me I mean
00:34:07.250 if somebody offers three times whatsomething is worth that sees candy the
00:34:11.389 buffalo news for showers whatever maybewe're not gonna sell it
00:34:14.480 I may be wrong and having that approachi know i'm not wrong with my own
00:34:18.440 daughter percent of aperture becausethat's the way I want to live my life
00:34:21.230 I've got all the money could possiblyneed
00:34:23.629 you know just amounts to which a changein the newspaper story on my obituary
00:34:28.429 and the amount of money the foundationhas and the break off relationships with
00:34:32.629 people i like and people that havejoined me because they think it's a
00:34:36.620 permanent home to do that simply becausesomebody waits a big check at me would
00:34:39.830 be like something for my childrenbecause up to a big shot
00:34:42.949 I won't do that and I want to tell mypartner's I won't do it so that they're
00:34:46.340 not disappointed me more and more withcertain stocks
00:34:51.409 we've got that approach now if we werechronically short of funds and all kinds
00:34:56.989 of opportunities coming we might have asomewhat different approach but our
00:35:00.980 inclination is not the cell thingsunless
00:35:04.400 we get really discouraged perhaps withthe management or we think the economic
00:35:09.079 characteristics of the business changein a big way
00:35:11.599 I mean and that happens so what I'mgoing to sell simply because it looks
00:35:14.809 too high
00:35:15.589 yep in all likelihood that mean that Ican't make that a hundred percent but
00:35:19.730 it's it's
00:35:20.960 that's that's that's the principle underwhich we operate we're generating right
00:35:26.119 now
00:35:27.230 five billion of cashier at least so it'sa hundred million bucks every week and
00:35:32.569 you know just met
00:35:33.740 we've been talking about half an hourand i'm not a damn thing so since you
00:35:40.579 know I think the real question is how doyou put it out intelligent by the ad and
00:35:44.450 if we were selling things would be justthat much more so they make their money
00:35:47.930 there may come a time when that wouldchange but what we want to and I have
00:35:52.970 partners
00:35:53.930 Cheryl were partners who would say ifyou can get three times what sees
00:35:58.069 candies worth why don't you sell it andthat's why I want to be sure before they
00:36:01.760 come in they know how I think on that Imean they're they're entitled to know
00:36:05.599 that that you really want to thank formeta you know if you're going to get
00:36:09.950 married and you want to mary's that'sgoing to last
00:36:15.440 initially the happiest married you knowor one that that Martha Stewart will
00:36:20.750 talk about anything that you want amarriage is gonna last
00:36:23.990 what quality you look for in a spouseone quality good for brains
00:36:29.960 you look for humor you look forcharacter to look for beauty
00:36:35.450 now you look for low expectations that
00:36:41.660 that is the marriage is gonna watch them
00:36:44.190 both have low expectations i made it andI want my partners to be on the low side
00:36:50.880 on expectations coming in because i wantthe marriage classes the financial
00:36:54.210 marriage when I join me at virtual and Idon't want him to think i'm going to do
00:36:58.470 things that I'm i'm not going to do sothat's that's our guiding principle
00:37:03.630 the device is all free in your medicaladvice everything
00:37:08.630 next time good morning it mr. Babbitt Ihave a question regarding evaluation of
00:37:13.790 the sounds of investment in recent yearsappears that the use of tax sheltering
00:37:19.640 in preparation is increasing and suchyou know reputable companies like UPS
00:37:24.200 and others involved in a cold part ofsilver shoulders with IRS and as we know
00:37:32.120 most of these transactions are veryartificial but yet there is the profit
00:37:37.490 there from the investor perspective doyou think it's beneficial for investor
00:37:42.530 that the company that they invest ainvolved no see
00:37:47.240 charters and if so do you think would behelpful is it built in such that
00:37:53.030 disclosed in statements and immediately
00:37:56.330 no statement not sure I got that ahundred percent George to you that i
00:38:03.020 will repeat that it and they are all theGiants shot at it
00:38:07.490 they if you think that the involvementof a corporation that you invest or
00:38:13.700 anybody for that matter invest in taxshelter which is by some definition of
00:38:18.980 that attack showers right
00:38:20.810 I've never used one yeah i know i wannago out to it saying so I'm asking if you
00:38:26.150 know that the corporation is involved insuch activity that is beneficial in
00:38:31.850 charts pattern would you would thinkthat that's helpful for investments
00:38:36.680 what does that mean there there's butthey're perfectly legal ways to show
00:38:42.050 their taxes i mean we we did and stilldo but we were the earliest ones to go
00:38:48.200 in for low income tax housing creditsthat guy met with President first
00:38:52.820 president Bush about about that one andthat benefits are still mild degree it
00:38:58.280 it's not a big element of virtue of itsa penis and in terms of pictures overall
00:39:03.020 value but it it is a congressionallyordained tax benefit
00:39:10.130 I wouldn't call exactly a shelter it's atax benefit that Congress has decided
00:39:13.970 they're willing to offer business
00:39:16.110 those and they that because they thinkit's the best way to to generate
00:39:20.160 low-income housing so we participate insomething but that it's not a it's not a
00:39:25.230 big factor and and what we do and what Iwant there's no there's nothing wrong
00:39:31.140 with that then if you get into taxevasion I mean that's a whole different
00:39:33.600 game that point they'll go to jail
00:39:35.430 no but certain businesses some insurancecompanies are incorporated in Bermuda
00:39:43.380 I that and add you can save a lot oftaxes you have to meet certain other
00:39:48.000 tests which we wouldn't want to meet
00:39:50.610 but if we were willing to meet thoseother tests
00:39:54.240 there's nothing illegal or immoral aboutus moving to Bermuda we're not going to
00:39:59.490 do it and what if if the restrictionswere done it that the tax code is the
00:40:05.820 rule book and you follow the rule but Ithink some of the things people do in
00:40:10.830 terms of bending that rule book get veryclose to frog and sometimes cross the
00:40:16.050 line into fraud and when they do I thinkthat would be be prosecuted but that's
00:40:21.570 that's another game and inside there hasbeen more pushing on that i would say in
00:40:26.430 the last five years and certainly was myexperience earlier and there are more
00:40:31.920 there's up I think now is diminished thelast year too but a couple years ago
00:40:36.390 there was very aggressive marketing bysome of the auditing firms and of these
00:40:41.850 even with sure
00:40:43.320 percentage shares of the gain to be paidto the others i think that those things
00:40:48.900 got fairly dubious and pretty when theyshopped for legal opinions and also that
00:40:53.280 if you got caught doing these things youcan say well I was rely on this legal
00:40:56.700 opinion and therefore I shouldn't go tojail but just pay the back taxes so I i
00:41:03.990 don't know how many anything wereassociated with it has done that but
00:41:07.470 I've obviously if they push too far wedon't want to be there
00:41:10.710 yep i was curious with the large numberof people you have now have with the
00:41:18.810 tremendous amounts of wealth what do youthink of the current state of
00:41:21.630 philanthropy
00:41:22.620 well
00:41:24.130 I'll be out this week and then actually10 : out flying on to Seattle and then
00:41:29.350 and talking to the United Way group outthere they see how well you hide away
00:41:32.800 raises more per capita I believe in iteither way in the country and and bill
00:41:37.570 gates will be there were talking jointlyhis mother was very active and the
00:41:41.890 united way but bill is going to giveaway over a billion dollars a year and a
00:41:47.770 lot more later on but right now abillion and it's very interesting and
00:41:51.160 he's very rational about it and he'svery informed in fact he got somebody I
00:41:56.200 think is primary advisor in the medicalfield as fellows with the CDC in Vienna
00:42:00.460 and bill reads 15 books so a month onthis i mean he is thinking just
00:42:05.680 absorbing I i wouldn't be able to get itthat fast but he just says with a
00:42:09.700 billion dollars he wants to save as manylives for years you can
00:42:12.550 so how did he get that his objectivehe's it's just as much a metric of his
00:42:16.780 of his foundation as some other metricreturn on capital might be for a
00:42:21.190 business and he says I'm going to spenda billion dollars or how many how many
00:42:24.670 lives can be saved for that so he'sgotten very heavily in the vaccines and
00:42:27.760 and AIDS in Africa number of things thatit's very rational i personally I think
00:42:36.490 I've all my 99 . something percent of mynet worth will go to a foundation after
00:42:44.830 the ladder of my wife and i and i amit's all going to go to foundation far
00:42:49.870 as i'm concerned i got from society'sgonna go to society
00:42:52.270 I've written a letter to my trusteesI've got very few trustees to get a
00:42:56.890 whole bunch of trustees in my view itthey just homogenized themselves down to
00:43:01.060 sort of the lowest common denominatorbecause he had 30 people in a room and
00:43:05.020 prestigious people but they're also allhave their particular all modern allow
00:43:09.370 other particular Hospital and it willbecome a big trade-off game you know
00:43:13.180 that they like Congress so
00:43:15.650 I have very few people and I don't givethem anything specific because I tell
00:43:20.450 them their judgment above ground will bebetter than my instructions from six
00:43:24.170 feet underground son that I don't liketo think that but it's true
00:43:27.470 so I tell him I look the society are theones that don't have an actual funding
00:43:36.350 constituents see you love or are justdamned intractable and very difficult to
00:43:41.180 solve
00:43:41.810 so I don't I am NOT going to haunt themat all
00:43:46.010 if they spend big money on some terriblyimportant problem and they fail because
00:43:50.240 they're taking on tough problems when Iby businesses i'm buying easy businesses
00:43:55.070 the reason that big problems of societyor big problems is that their damn tough
00:43:59.420 to solve so they're they're swinging atbad pitches
00:44:02.570 I'm swinging it easy pictures inbusiness but they're swinging it they
00:44:04.970 have to swing at bad pitches but i tellhim i wanted to try and do it and if
00:44:08.690 they fail it doesn't bother me at alland I tell them if they give a million
00:44:11.690 bucks here and a million bucks there ina million bucks there
00:44:14.450 they're not going to sleep because I'mgonna be haunting him I'm going to come
00:44:16.970 back every night you know I did not wantthe eyedropper approach used to flying
00:44:21.560 through p
00:44:22.250 but I want them to use their judgment tolook at important problems that do not
00:44:27.620 have a natural funding constituency
00:44:29.660 you know if the government's going tofind it fine you know I mean they should
00:44:32.450 be funding important problems but wedon't need to do it
00:44:35.480 the the ball applied to be in my I havein my opinion is the fun things that
00:44:39.110 don't have the natural constituents andthat's what bills doing there isn't the
00:44:43.250 neck there are a bunch of people aroundthat you can make an emotional appeal to
00:44:48.710 to make vaccines available to millionsand millions of kids around the world it
00:44:55.040 just doesn't target anybody's heartstrange you can make buildings after
00:44:58.430 mean it just isn't the sort of thingthat you can raise money for on an
00:45:03.170 emotional basis and there's nothingwrong with raising money on our
00:45:06.170 emotional basis but that is a problemwill get solved by a funny constituent
00:45:10.820 it was responding to that but bill isresponding to what it is
00:45:14.540 mind is that is the important thingwhich is saving lives and he doesn't
00:45:18.410 care whether it gets his name on abuilding or whether anything happens or
00:45:21.710 what everybody knows about it and hegets published they just because of the
00:45:24.590 scale is on but it
00:45:26.150 he doesn't care about that i can promiseyou that so that's my philosophy is that
00:45:30.650 I got this money not because i'm asuperior human being not because I've
00:45:37.850 done more for society and other people
00:45:40.100 I was wired the right way to be droppedinto the United States at this
00:45:47.600 particular time
00:45:48.650 I mean it's a huge capitalistic societyand I'm wired
00:45:52.550 no credit to me but it born that way sothat I'm better an asset allocation than
00:45:57.440 other people to some degree
00:45:59.030 just like other people are better at allkinds of other things and I was with two
00:46:02.750 teachers out of the sun valley
00:46:04.340 they're doing more for society that I amand they don't
00:46:07.460 this market system does nothing for themmarket system does all kinds of things
00:46:11.240 for me
00:46:12.140 kate says if I have been born fivethousand years ago you know I have been
00:46:15.770 some animals lunch
00:46:16.970 you know because i can't run very fast
00:46:18.800 climb trees I mean you know what thosestate and I could I could tell that
00:46:22.610 animal is chasing me in a way that wesee how I can allocate assets you know
00:46:25.850 it wouldn't make any difference
00:46:29.030 so here I am yeah i'm bored out again Ithe just very very lucky and at the odds
00:46:34.760 when i was born in nineteen thirty theodds with 50 to 1 against baby born the
00:46:38.060 United States
00:46:38.900 that's a terrible set onto the face andthen I was rock down here you know and
00:46:42.710 if I then drop down and / or someplaceER or China
00:46:46.370 I mean I wouldn't have a chance sosociety is what does it for you and and
00:46:51.140 it should go back and might be with yougo back to society if you've been lucky
00:46:54.860 enough to be dropped into a societywhere your particular wiring pays off
00:47:01.010 big
00:47:01.880 now it that that's just luck and and youknow there's nothing wrong with being
00:47:06.980 like I don't feel guilty about anythingelse but i also don't feel that I feel
00:47:10.790 like I have a lot of fun doing what I dobut I feel the money should go back into
00:47:14.450 society and it should go back asintelligently as it can and best way to
00:47:20.120 do it intelligently is to have highgrade and intelligent people
00:47:24.350 administering it at the time and youdon't know the problems that are going
00:47:29.600 to be out there 10 years from now or 20years from now or 30 years from now but
00:47:32.690 i do know if I've got a small number ofhigh-grade smart people and high grade
00:47:39.260 is more applied out
00:47:40.310 Oh of if you gave me 20 extra points ofIQ but but cheated a little on the high
00:47:45.350 grade I wouldn't take it because thatthey got to be they got to be there's
00:47:49.010 somebody chances that to do things in apetty way or you know do try to make
00:47:55.610 people get supported in their own mindsto their own interests rather than the
00:47:58.790 interest of the institution so I reallywant super high-grade people doing it
00:48:02.270 and I've got them and I think the moneymight do a lot of good it may do no good
00:48:07.340 but it will be operating in fields or ifit doesn't good that good probably would
00:48:12.680 have been done otherwise
00:48:15.410 yep
00:48:17.250 I'm just wondering there's a lot ofdifferences between the recent boom and
00:48:22.320 bust the stock market and one in thenineteen twenties but there's also a lot
00:48:26.370 of similarities and the simulators areallowing people to draw the conclusion
00:48:30.750 that stock prices will be trappeddepressed for some time to come
00:48:35.730 what where do you disagree agree withthat we bought in the the whole century
00:48:40.410 is quite interesting if you take the20th century it was unbelievable century
00:48:46.470 for the United States the gdp per capitaand that's the way to think of this per
00:48:50.970 capita sometimes they talk about our gdpvs Europe's but if their populations the
00:48:54.840 same every year an artist goes up onepercent you've gotta you know in the end
00:48:58.470 of the goods you gotta i have a divisoras well as the numerator and and so gdp
00:49:03.780 per capita in the 20th century in theUnited States one of six hundred and ten
00:49:07.890 percent actually qualitatively went toofar more than that because you can't
00:49:12.870 really measure you know certain thingsand medicine or whatever it may be it
00:49:16.800 and the improvements but just out ofquantitative basis
00:49:19.680 it went up every single decade includingthe decade of the thirties
00:49:23.070 so here you have a hundred years whenbasically the US citizen really was
00:49:31.110 getting was improving their lot decadeby decade by decade the thirties
00:49:35.940 it was a 13-percent that's decade wasWorld War 2 the night the forties
00:49:41.670 36-percent the worst decade was thefirst world war so you get sometimes the
00:49:46.410 analogy I can get in trouble andanalogies but any of that it was it was
00:49:49.620 a huge . interestingly enough there weresix big periods in there for the stock
00:49:57.360 market in both directions
00:49:59.760 there were three big bull market from1910 1920 one
00:50:03.870 the Dow want from 66 to 70 one less thana 10-percent move in 20 years
00:50:10.710 less than half a percent here you gotevidence to put a half of it didn't move
00:50:14.730 from 21 to 29 as you point out at what
00:50:18.360 it went from 71 to a high of 381 inSeptember
00:50:21.930 of 1929 while five hundred percent
00:50:25.200 well obviously the country well being ofthe country thing about five hundred
00:50:28.410 percent during that period and thewell-being of the company in the country
00:50:31.200 about the whole lot more than tenpercent during that first 21 years so he
00:50:35.430 had this very uneven development from 19from september's 1929 until the end of
00:50:40.710 1948 the download from 381 to about ahundred and eighty was cut in half and
00:50:47.640 that was eighteen long years and yet theper capita gdp was moving right up
00:50:52.890 during this whole period to the economyis doing fine for 38 265 the doll one
00:50:57.839 again from about a hundred eighty up toclose to a thousand again 541 which was
00:51:02.940 far outstripping from 65 to 80 1 thedoll went down literally
00:51:09.630 well again per capita to be and thenwe've had this last period where it's
00:51:13.829 going to prolifically if you take thewhole hundred years it went up a hundred
00:51:17.760 and eighty-four one every thousanddollars became a hundred eighty thousand
00:51:20.819 but forty three and a quarter you'reforty three and three-quarters years
00:51:24.569 with those three big huge bull marketsand fifty six and a quarter years with
00:51:30.299 periods of stagnation all in an economythat was doing fine
00:51:34.859 you know year after year after yourfifty six and a quarter years
00:51:38.520 net the dow was down a couple otherpoints during that period and the other
00:51:42.089 forty three and three-quarters yearsmade up the rest of this move from 66 to
00:51:46.109 11,000 someone to dallas self-excitedyourself how could it be that you can
00:51:52.380 have a country was doing better andbetter and better and better citizens
00:51:56.549 we're living every every generation wasliving better than the one that preceded
00:52:00.540 it
00:52:00.930 but you have these huge changes biggains a few times long period of
00:52:06.180 stagnation 20 years I mean that's a longtime to do nothing
00:52:10.020 the answer is that investors behave invery human ways which is they get very
00:52:15.930 excited during bull markets and theylook in the rearview mirror and they say
00:52:20.160 I made money last year
00:52:21.930 i'm going to make more money this yearso this time I'll borrow an hour or the
00:52:25.349 neighbor says you know I wasn't it lastyear when that neighbor was dumber than
00:52:29.400 I am a lot of money so i'm going to goin this year's they're always looking at
00:52:32.309 the river
00:52:32.880 where and when they look in the rearviewmirror and they see a lot of money
00:52:35.910 having been made in the last few yearsthey plow and they just push and push
00:52:39.870 and push on prices and when they look inthe rearview mirror and I see no money
00:52:43.620 having been made
00:52:44.790 they just say this is a lousy place tobe so they don't care what's going on in
00:52:49.050 the underlying business and it's it'sastounding but that's that makes for a
00:52:52.470 huge opportunity just huge opportunity
00:52:55.860 I mean I have lived through roughly halfin investing sense about half that . and
00:53:00.840 I've had that long period of stagnationfrom 48
00:53:05.730 I mean from 65 to 80 - 17 years
00:53:10.770 I wrote an article for forbes in 1979 Ijust how can this be
00:53:15.420 pension funds in the nineteen seventyput a hundred and some percent of their
00:53:18.960 new money in stock because they werewild about stocks then they got a lot
00:53:22.530 cheaper and they put our record low innine percent of that nobody in the 1970s
00:53:27.000 when stocks for way cheaper peoplebehave very peculiarly and and in terms
00:53:32.640 of the reactions because they they'rehuman beings and they get excited when
00:53:36.540 others get excited they get greedy whenothers get greedy they get fearful one
00:53:39.540 other get fearful and they'll continueto do so and you will see you know if
00:53:44.250 you will see things you won't believe inyour lifetime and securities markets and
00:53:49.140 the country will do very well over timebut you will see these huge waves and
00:53:54.660 then and if you can stay objectivethroughout that you can detach yourself
00:54:01.860 temperamentally from the crowd
00:54:04.410 you get very rich and you won't have tobe very bright
00:54:08.100 I mean it I'm sure you are but but
00:54:10.830 that one you know it just it doesn'ttake brains it takes temperament
00:54:14.730 it takes the ability to sit there andlook at something when i started out in
00:54:19.290 nineteen fifty i would go through andfind things at two times earnings and
00:54:22.500 they were perfectly decent businessesand people want two jobs at those
00:54:25.140 companies and everybody knew they weregoing to be around anyone behind with
00:54:28.650 two times earnings and that's wheninterest rates for two and a half
00:54:30.690 percent you know I went to the startinstalling security lights 21 and I
00:54:37.170 Kansas City Life Insurance Company haveto be a fairly prominent company in
00:54:40.350 omaha and the policies they sold googleif you're buying life in church from
00:54:46.140 them had a building and assumption oftwo percent interest the stock of kansas
00:54:51.120 city life was selling it
00:54:53.370 less than three times earnings you'regetting 35% if you bought the stock
00:54:58.050 no question about the sound of thecompany I went to the local agent as I
00:55:01.860 figure it out I'll give yourself him afew shares of stock I mean think I
00:55:04.770 understand he's got his whole lifeinvested in this company with the local
00:55:07.950 agent
00:55:08.640 we've been with them for 20 years and asname is mo size of mr. moose and you
00:55:14.130 know you're selling these policies with2% even have a few members of your own
00:55:17.430 family and you can buy into this companywhose paycheck youtube and on every
00:55:21.390 month that you know and whose future youof your your beneficiaries of his life
00:55:24.990 policy depend on and who you're sellingthem you know a two percent investment
00:55:28.830 on and you get thirty five percent ofyour money you know and i'm stuck trying
00:55:33.510 to be good and then I couldn't Iconsultant and I'm i will allow
00:55:36.990 themselves when I mean the world youhave to start with that but but it just
00:55:40.950 blew me away
00:55:41.970 it blew me away I thought sometimes Iused to wonder if I his nuts you know
00:55:45.120 that that but those things the samething happened I mean 1964 the dow
00:55:51.030 closed the dates
00:55:51.960 864 and then a 1981 17 years later laterit closed at age 65 and move one . in 17
00:55:59.760 years now it's not a big move and thatyou can't believe the how discouraged
00:56:06.630 people were by that by the during thatperiod but you know people are looking
00:56:11.700 better
00:56:12.710 so things can go on a long time
00:56:16.430 that don't make sense and but they don'tcome to an end i mean the internet thing
00:56:21.680 I mean you had these companies sellingfor many billions of dollars that had
00:56:25.430 nope
00:56:25.880 really frankly no prospects are makingany money that that's a that's a bubble
00:56:29.210 butt hurt sign one time said anythingthat can't go on forever will end now
00:56:35.240 that's a pretty good
00:56:36.630 but think about that and particularlythink about it next time you're trying
00:56:40.590 to do something just because the stock'sgone ball a lot you know many of your
00:56:44.100 neighbors make money or something thatyou've got to be
00:56:47.430 she's had to sit and think objectivelyand think about what i buy this whole
00:56:52.170 business
00:56:52.980 it's an Internet companies got a hundredmillion shares outstanding a hundred
00:56:56.760 that's ten billion dollars is it worthten billion dollars
00:56:59.910 it's worth ten billion dollars it's gotto be able to give you you know seven or
00:57:04.260 eight hundred million next year and ifit doesn't give you seven or eight
00:57:07.590 hundred million next year he has a goodmove
00:57:09.720 maybe ten percent more than that theyear after and continue to him
00:57:12.750 there are a lot of businesses can dothat and people just go crazy and of
00:57:18.030 course it's fun
00:57:19.440 I mean it's you know it's like that signthey put in doctors offices and says
00:57:24.480 avoid hangover state rock and up thatminute
00:57:27.720 it's just so much fun to keep like butyeah you got it you got to do sensible
00:57:32.400 things to get to get that result
00:57:34.350 yeah yeah next well we got three peoplestanding there so let's let's do the
00:57:38.670 three that are standing ok
00:57:39.990 good morning sir hi I i was wonderingwhat your opinion is the Federal Reserve
00:57:44.310 and their actions taken recently youfeel like done and not to fix the
00:57:47.910 economy
00:57:48.630 yeah well I'm a big fan of alangreenspan's over time I've known him for
00:57:51.780 a long long time we were on a boardtogether
00:57:53.700 caption reason Alan is a very very smartguy he is motivated in my opinion
00:57:59.430 entirely by whatever for the UnitedStates people united states it
00:58:03.600 so you better that you've got youcouldn't have a better person in there
00:58:06.240 and the problem
00:58:09.570 he may have is that that because histenure in office has been associated
00:58:15.690 with this incredible all market thatthat even though he wouldn't have
00:58:20.280 claimed credit for that people appliedassociated because of the importance of
00:58:24.120 the Fed generally they might associatewith him so they made if things don't
00:58:27.630 work out so well made blame them as wellbut I think his policy is generally been
00:58:30.810 very good
00:58:31.680 you have to understand one thing thatabout the Fed is that it's not as
00:58:37.980 powerful as the mystique would make it
00:58:40.770 it's a break is better than its gaspedal when the Fed wants to put on the
00:58:45.810 brakes
00:58:46.740 we go for the windshield I mean how doyou know the economy just wrong
00:58:50.850 yeah and they can put on the brakes PaulWalker did it
00:58:54.930 he broke inflation by doing it but Imean when he put on the brakes and that
00:58:59.190 . around nineteen eighty i mean peoplehated he was crucified for what is the
00:59:03.630 right thing to do and he could do it hedid it all by himself and these he and
00:59:08.850 and it was the only way because of themomentum the inflation was generating it
00:59:12.150 was the only thing that was what wasneeded then normally unpopular
00:59:16.920 it's much harder for a Greenspan to puton the brakes because nobody wants him
00:59:23.970 to put on the brakes busty so visiblebut he's put them on sort of gradually
00:59:29.520 but stepping on the gas pedal
00:59:33.420 he does not necessarily get the sameresult it may help but there are a
00:59:39.180 thousand other variables operating andas you see in Japan
00:59:43.200 you know you can get down to zerointerest rates and you can stimulate
00:59:46.230 anything so it isn't like the Japanesehaven't read the same books we read
00:59:50.580 about economics I mean they've readcanes and they were the whole thing so
00:59:54.240 we're not smarter than they are
00:59:56.190 we don't have any secrets they don'thave but they don't know how to get
00:59:59.609 their economy going and you know there
01:00:03.510  two  GPA has beengoing no place you know in the last five
01:00:07.440 years and still problems around so easymoney doesn't solve everything but
01:00:12.300 Greenspan could very well get blamed forthe fact that that he hasn't solved
01:00:17.910 everything and it's just not in hispower to solve it can help in various
01:00:22.350 ways and I've I don't think you couldhave anybody but he better and I think
01:00:25.890 he's done the right thing to this pointbut the right thing may not be quite as
01:00:29.790 as effective as as people may help thatwould be in economics as always you
01:00:36.060 always want to ask and then what youread in the paper well what happens if
01:00:40.500 the Japanese start selling governmentour government bonds or what happened
01:00:44.250 they dumped the dollar they can't dumpthe dollar
01:00:46.920 there's a way to dump dollars you couldyou can at least dollar assets because
01:00:50.760 the Japanese want to sell government ourgovernment bonds
01:00:54.580 they sell up to us and they get a timedeposit or a demand deposits it here
01:00:58.870 they still own a dollar asset if theysell them to the French they get it and
01:01:02.530 they may get some answers from theFrench but now the French habit I mean
01:01:05.140 the only way you can reduce foreigninvestment in the United States is to
01:01:11.650 change it around so they're consumingmore than from us more than were
01:01:15.610 consuming from that might be one oncewhen we buy a television set from Japan
01:01:20.500 if we buy more television sets from themthan they buy equivalent consumables
01:01:24.850 from us
01:01:25.660 the exchange of what balances things iswe give them some investment type asset
01:01:31.180 whether it's cash or US government bondsor stocks or movie studios are real
01:01:35.770 estate or different things and the onlyway that reverses is when we start
01:01:40.420 running a trade surplus which were milesaway from so logically you know if you
01:01:46.660 read classic economics that you wouldbelieve that our currency would have
01:01:52.150 been weak along
01:01:53.050 Earl weaker over the recent years andthat it would be a week now but there
01:02:00.130 are other things operating and that'sone of the problems about economics is
01:02:03.040 there's never just one variable
01:02:04.630 there's usually hundreds of variablesand they operate with different impact
01:02:10.120 at different times
01:02:12.520 I mean it's a it's it's not like aphysics for me if I mean it tho i guess
01:02:15.520 it would be if you get in the Heisenbergprinciple or something like that but but
01:02:18.520 the the formula has a lot of the samevariables year after year but the
01:02:26.080 relative importance of those variablesand how they interact with each other is
01:02:30.190 never exactly the same and that's whatwe find out the Japanese find out
01:02:33.280 everybody finds out and and foreigncurrency or the currents are the value
01:02:37.630 of a dollar and currency rates aredefying what you would expect based on
01:02:42.700 history but somebody said of historywere perfect guide you know the Forbes
01:02:47.470 400 would all be librarians you knowshe's going to look it up in the books
01:02:50.830 and it always you know all the answersbut it
01:02:54.310 history doesn't repeat itself as MarkTwain said i was going to repeat itself
01:02:57.790 but it rhymes I mean things come backbut they don't quite come back in the
01:03:01.510 same format will understand all thisperfectly for years why the dollars
01:03:05.620 behave the way it has but I i think itwould be useful
01:03:08.650 net from the US if the dollar was strong
01:03:12.250 yes mr. Buffett thanks for taking myquestion my question pertains to small
01:03:18.820 business and my family spending thetruckload sector of transportation for
01:03:23.410 about 50 years and as you talked aboutthe airline industry and other merchants
01:03:27.850 next week
01:03:28.510 acquisitions and things going on and alot of the smaller players being tossed
01:03:33.580 out of the market
01:03:35.170 what do you see for people that likethis room for students that want to
01:03:38.740 start a small business and maybe theywant to start in a business that is
01:03:43.090 somewhat of a commodity type businessbut as businesses the large corporations
01:03:47.980 get larger and their deficienciesincrease how can a small businesses
01:03:52.390 compete
01:03:53.680 it has these people the idea the in manyareas small businesses have an advantage
01:04:00.760 you know another businesses scale has ahuge advantage and I mean you don't want
01:04:05.500 to be a a tiny carbon steel producer onthe other hand when many miles came
01:04:09.430 along and learn how to use scrap moreeffectively that than the the older
01:04:13.630 methods of making steel they actuallyhad managed to scale is a huge advantage
01:04:19.090 in some businesses
01:04:20.710 it's you know the largest airlineshaven't won southwest airlines as one
01:04:25.300 starting with you know just a few planesflying down there between houston and
01:04:28.270 allison and they have become bigger buttheir ambition hasn't been to be the
01:04:33.940 biggest and you know they they probablyby the fuel of just as cheap as United
01:04:38.200 that we bought it you know when there'slots more walmart is a classic example I
01:04:41.380 mean who would have thought 25 years ago30 years ago
01:04:46.210 i'm here with serious with a hundredstory plus building in Chicago had
01:04:50.710 access to money far cheaper than sample
01:04:53.110 I'm Sam was credit was not as good asserious every supplier wanted to do
01:04:56.710 business with sears nobody ever heard ofSam every real-estate developer was
01:05:00.370 developing a new shopping center wentfirst to sears on Sam got
01:05:04.430 the short end so here's the guysstarting in bentonville arkansas and he
01:05:09.560 kills them over time
01:05:10.910 just playing kills him and disadvantagedand buying disadvantage and borrowing
01:05:14.990 disadvantage in real estate advantage
01:05:17.990 Sam Walton and his ability to inspire inthe end hundreds of thousands of people
01:05:23.060 to be enthusiastic about going to workand doing although doing the right
01:05:26.630 things over time so i would be just asoptimistic about small business
01:05:31.460 generally now there's certain areaswhere scale just as i was just playing
01:05:36.590 important but but I see no disadvantagewe intentionally at Berkshire we have a
01:05:41.930 hundred and twelve thousand employeesmore in Georgia than any other state in
01:05:45.980 the Union incidentally we employ a lotof their don't and then we put a lot of
01:05:51.890 people are making a guy go ad weintentionally with our hundred and
01:05:56.480 twelve thousand but we probably haveabout how many business units but lots
01:06:00.320 at will have 13.8 people at headquarters
01:06:04.220 I'm not the point agent said that my Iresent it when people like that i have a
01:06:07.670 full but we have one that works fourdays a week then that's all we have at
01:06:11.000 headquarters hundred twelve thousandpeople a hundred and five billion market
01:06:14.750 cap but we intentionally keep our unitssmall we think we want them to have the
01:06:21.950 nimbleness the responsiveness of thecustomer particularly that will turn
01:06:27.050 them you know that essentially will morethan offset anything that the scale of
01:06:33.200 having maybe a little more purchasingpower something when the will develop we
01:06:37.550 own a home furnishing with furniturehome furnishings business in utah run by
01:06:41.810 phone bill child he was featured inFortune about one issue ago that it did
01:06:46.730 the cover story was God in business itwas and it was Bill was the number one
01:06:51.260 illustration built up that business fromhis father-in-law was doing two hundred
01:06:55.820 fifty thousand dollars a year and then Iwas over half the business in utah in
01:06:59.690 this field but you're close to 400million he built by thinking about the
01:07:04.040 customer and the truth with he wascompeting with sears he was competing
01:07:07.310 with rabbits was a huge furnitureretailer the retailer in the past he was
01:07:12.050 competing with everybody but
01:07:14.779 all he thought about from the moment hegot up in the morning was how do I take
01:07:19.130 care of my customer and that wins
01:07:21.380 we have a business in Omaha some of youmay have heard of
01:07:25.579 it's the largest home furnishing storein the world in all which only has a SMS
01:07:31.429 a of 650,000 people
01:07:33.529 it's on 72 acres
01:07:36.739 it's does 325 million dollars in onelocation which happens to be five
01:07:42.919 hundred dollars for every man woman andchild in the SMS a but it draws from
01:07:46.099 beyond that that business comes abouther as resulted from an investment of
01:07:54.859 five hundred dollars in 1937 by a womanwho walked out of Russia in 1921
01:08:03.199 she'll and she walked out . on a peanutboat landed in seattle with a tag around
01:08:09.019 her neck she could speak one word ofEnglish the American Red Cross look at
01:08:12.709 the tag is at Fort Dodge Iowa
01:08:14.599 they got a fort dodge I what shecouldn't pick up the language she was
01:08:18.439 there two years
01:08:19.429 she said she felt like a dummy so shecame to homo because there were other
01:08:22.759 Russian Jews there and she's at leasthave somebody to talk to her little girl
01:08:26.599 started school
01:08:27.920 Francis Francis would come home at nightand teach her mother the words you
01:08:32.448 learned in school that day that's howthis woman rose bump can learn the
01:08:35.658 English language but from her from herdaughter from kindergarten on teaching
01:08:39.259 of the words she bought seven siblingsover from Russia one of the time 50
01:08:44.988 bucks every time she say fifty bucks shesold used clothing and the works
01:08:48.738 she had her seven siblings over hermother and father and by 1937 16 years
01:08:54.679 after she got here she saved fivehundred dollars
01:08:57.229 she got out of train went to Chicago tothe American Furniture Mart which was
01:09:02.118 huge
01:09:03.259 impressive things you had this - smartas hell but she fought like a peasant
01:09:06.979 away and she saw this building shedecided to name her company then browse
01:09:10.460 current you want about five hundreddollars worth of got about two thousand
01:09:14.420 dollars worth of you
01:09:15.770 merchandise all the way back to Omahashe worried because she thought I old
01:09:20.600 $1,500 and she only had afive-hundred-dollar equity so she got to
01:09:24.979 Omaha
01:09:25.939 she took the bed the sofa
01:09:29.779 the refrigerator out of her own home tosell fast
01:09:34.130 so she could get the money so she canpay on time she took that business and
01:09:38.240 build it from that start
01:09:40.100 no one would sell to her she went tocourt four times because they tried to
01:09:43.910 the carpet manufacturers tried to keepher from selling the discount and she
01:09:47.450 went into court
01:09:48.589 add told the judge because you figuredout ways to buy this stuff in various
01:09:53.180 nefarious ways from other hand of peopleby a foreign she said look at i pay
01:09:57.350 three dollars a yard for this carpet
01:09:59.180 brandeis sells it for 698 is I sell itfor 398
01:10:02.720 just tell me judge how much you want meto rob people she defended herself
01:10:05.360 papers wrote it up the judge boughtcarpet from her the next day I mean it
01:10:08.690 was no marvelous
01:10:10.210 Brandeis is selling anymore they werethe huge department store , she put
01:10:14.410 everybody out of business and the punchline
01:10:16.600 she worked till she was a hundred andthree she sold me the business when she
01:10:19.810 was 89 and she didn't have she didn'thave an audit
01:10:24.460 I went out this year I want afternoontook a check out with Nana had because I
01:10:28.810 knew she wanted to do something and Isaid mrs. B here's the money
01:10:32.350 I said I don't even know what just tellme where the only money that never open
01:10:35.500 any money since I all those guys back innineteen thirty-seven and she said it's
01:10:39.370 all free and clear
01:10:40.510 she never seen a balance sheet shedidn't know what accounting terms mad
01:10:44.500 but she understood the nature of thebusiness and i told her i said i'd
01:10:48.520 rather have I don't have your word andother than an order from every one of
01:10:53.110 the big six or bigger or whatever theirword number at the time of the top are
01:10:57.130 turning from sin and she worked till shewas a hundred and three
01:11:00.550 she died a hundred and four she hadthree siblings at her funeral
01:11:05.800 I mean those are some genes her sonworks there now he's eighty two or three
01:11:09.700 and the three sisters are all alive butthe punch line is she couldn't read or
01:11:14.920 write this woman could not read or writeif you told her this room was sixty
01:11:19.180 eight feet by 43 she would tell you howmany square yards it was like that she
01:11:25.000 ever went to school to be in her lifeshe would tell you how much that wasn't
01:11:28.480 598 yards she had the tax
01:11:30.640 she's not about something that she likedyour looks and that would be it
01:11:34.120 and that was that you know that is thethat that you can't beat that
01:11:39.760 you know had and you can't replicatethat at General Motors you can't
01:11:43.780 institutionalize that that the personwho brings that kind of drive to a
01:11:49.060 business and does it day after day andthinks about the customer
01:11:54.280 yeah and that's all she did I can't andonce you've raised four kids in the
01:11:59.230 process to but you can't hit it can'tmiss and not you don't have to worry if
01:12:03.880 you're an entrepreneur in most fieldsare some field work
01:12:08.260 you can't do it because there are somescale aspects to it but in most fields
01:12:12.460 you know you will kill people by Seanthat which was shocked
01:12:16.060 nobody ever heard of Sean carpet 30years ago and got forty percent of
01:12:19.680 the business in the country - so don't Idid
01:12:22.980 it's a great field of opportunity outthere and i had and i know about
01:12:27.630 trucking specifically but I wish you thebest on it then your you won't be at a
01:12:31.320 disadvantage in many fields if you'resmall and you'll actually have an
01:12:34.470 advantage for thank you
