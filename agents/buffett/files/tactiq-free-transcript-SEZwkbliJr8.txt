00:00:34.860 [Music]
00:00:48.140 I'm Andy serwer welcome to a special
00:00:51.210 edition of influencers from Omaha
00:00:53.520 Nebraska it's my pleasure to welcome
00:00:55.710 Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett
00:00:58.590 Warren welcome thanks for coming so
00:01:01.290 let's start off and talk about the
00:01:03.750 economy a little bit and obviously we've
00:01:06.240 been on a good long run here a very long
00:01:08.940 run and yet does that surprise you and
00:01:11.130 what would be the signs that you would
00:01:12.720 look for to see the things were winding
00:01:14.790 down well I look at a lot of figures
00:01:17.310 just in connection with our businesses I
00:01:19.759 I like to get numbers not so so I'm
00:01:23.940 getting reports in weekly in some
00:01:27.090 businesses uh that but that doesn't tell
00:01:30.090 me what the economy's gonna do six
00:01:31.170 months from now or three months from now
00:01:32.520 it tells me what's going on now with our
00:01:34.679 businesses and it really doesn't make
00:01:38.700 any difference in what I do today in
00:01:41.340 terms of buying stocks are buying
00:01:42.780 businesses what those numbers tell me
00:01:44.759 they're interesting but they're not
00:01:46.110 they're not guidance to make yeah
00:01:48.300 if we buy business we're gonna older
00:01:50.069 forever so we're gonna good your bad
00:01:51.810 years in between years may be a
00:01:53.430 disastrous year something here and and
00:01:57.020 we care a lot about the price we do not
00:02:00.090 care about the next 12 months but are
00:02:02.219 you surprised at how long this economy
00:02:04.920 has been expanding I've been surprised
00:02:06.600 by all kinds of things in the last ten
00:02:08.459 years about the economy I mean I I don't
00:02:11.760 think there was any economists I've ever
00:02:14.400 read that talked about negative interest
00:02:16.920 rates for long periods of time I mean if
00:02:19.650 you go back and read Keynes or you read
00:02:21.840 Samuelson you read anything they do not
00:02:23.700 get into a negative rate environment I
00:02:26.549 think now there's still 11 trillion
00:02:27.870 that's of government debt around the
00:02:30.269 world that's at a negative rate so we've
00:02:33.660 never seen it before
00:02:34.739 and we've never seen at least the
00:02:38.280 conventional wisdom Otto this is same
00:02:40.140 period of long and growing deficits
00:02:43.170 while the economy is getting better
00:02:44.750 extremely low interest rates and really
00:02:47.370 very little inflation so something
00:02:50.790 different is happening but something
00:02:51.690 different happens all the time so and
00:02:54.540 that's one reason economic predictions
00:02:57.090 just don't enter into our decisions
00:02:58.709 Charlie Munger my partner
00:03:00.250 in you know 54 years now we've never
00:03:04.750 made a decision based on an economic
00:03:06.810 prediction whim and we make business
00:03:08.710 predictions about individual businesses
00:03:11.080 will do overtime and we compare that to
00:03:14.040 what we have to pay for but we have
00:03:17.170 never said yes to something because we
00:03:19.960 thought the economy was gonna do well in
00:03:22.210 the next year or two years and we've
00:03:23.890 never said no to anything because we
00:03:26.380 were right in the middle of a panic even
00:03:28.000 if the price was right all right so you
00:03:30.100 don't pay much attention to the dismal
00:03:31.630 scientists then I guess well I pay none
00:03:33.730 in the sense of as a guideline to doing
00:03:37.990 anything I've it's entertainment I mean
00:03:40.390 you know it's like going to variety show
00:03:42.220 or something like that but and I just
00:03:46.510 don't know of any economist that that
00:03:49.030 actually is what business is
00:03:51.520 successively as successfully or done
00:03:55.540 well in stock Paul Samuelson didn't know
00:03:58.090 he was a big shareholder burger but it's
00:04:02.470 you know they make guesses and though
00:04:05.470 there's so many variables I mean in in
00:04:08.110 the hard sciences you know you know that
00:04:10.840 you know if an Apple falls from a tree
00:04:12.880 that is gonna change over the centuries
00:04:15.370 because of anything or political
00:04:16.930 developments or 400 other variables that
00:04:19.029 go in but when you get into economics
00:04:22.110 there's so many variables and and the
00:04:25.360 truth is you've got to expect good times
00:04:27.669 and bad times in business and if you if
00:04:32.169 you were to buy an auto dealership and
00:04:34.330 you're you know wherever you live
00:04:35.860 locally or a McDonald's franchise or
00:04:38.440 anything like that you wouldn't try and
00:04:40.450 time the purchase you try and make the
00:04:41.979 right purchase at the right price and
00:04:43.720 you wanna be sure you got a good
00:04:44.740 business but you wouldn't say I'm gonna
00:04:46.479 buy it because growth this year is gonna
00:04:48.550 be 3% instead of a 2.8 percent or
00:04:51.160 something the sword fair enough
00:04:53.050 you have over a hundred billion dollars
00:04:55.930 of cash
00:05:01.390 you Berkshire has over 100 billion in
00:05:03.490 cash and you say that you always want
00:05:05.710 this company to be a fortress so how
00:05:08.410 much cash should an ordinary investor
00:05:11.560 have on a percentage basis
00:05:13.330 it depends on a personal situation I've
00:05:15.610 had it if you're working and something
00:05:18.550 where you're living off your your your
00:05:21.460 paycheck from week to week you want to
00:05:24.610 have a little cash or around then and
00:05:26.199 you certainly don't want to have a
00:05:27.159 credit card that's maxed out or anything
00:05:29.050 like that
00:05:30.190 but if you know if your house is paid
00:05:34.180 off if you don't have big living
00:05:36.490 expenses
00:05:37.389 you got a portfolio of decent
00:05:41.080 diversified businesses we need any cash
00:05:45.690 so you can be more cash free than
00:05:50.530 Berkshire is yeah yeah I've got
00:05:54.580 responsibilities you know we've got
00:05:55.900 insurance claims we could have
00:05:57.430 hurricanes that you know what happened
00:05:59.909 all kinds of things we might have to pay
00:06:02.740 up billions of dollars and I've got over
00:06:04.719 a million people that own shares that
00:06:06.849 are coming up run the place so we get
00:06:09.669 through periods like that but if I were
00:06:12.729 retired I had a say a million dollar
00:06:15.219 portfolio stocks that was paying me
00:06:17.340 30,000 a year in dividends or something
00:06:19.719 of the sort and my children were growing
00:06:22.000 the house was paid off of everything but
00:06:24.090 you know I wouldn't worry too much about
00:06:26.469 having a lot of cash around let's talk a
00:06:29.590 little bit about Apple everyone always
00:06:31.270 wants to talk about animal right it's
00:06:32.740 kind of the its stock it company you
00:06:35.469 have a forty five billion dollar stake
00:06:37.389 more or less how closely do you follow
00:06:39.759 the company you know people are
00:06:41.680 concerned they haven't really introduced
00:06:43.240 any new products well if you have to
00:06:45.250 closely follow our company you shouldn't
00:06:47.259 don't really know I made it I mean if
00:06:50.110 you if you buy a business did you buy a
00:06:52.629 farm you know you go up and look you
00:06:55.690 know every couple weeks to see how far
00:06:57.190 the corn is up and you know you worry
00:06:59.469 too much about whether somebody says
00:07:01.000 this is gonna be a year of low prices
00:07:02.560 because it's exports are being affected
00:07:04.569 or anything like that you know you buy a
00:07:06.279 farm and you hold it for I got one farm
00:07:09.159 that I bought in the 1980s and my son
00:07:11.800 runs it but I've been there once you
00:07:15.219 know I mean it it doesn't grow faster if
00:07:17.889 I go and stare at it you know I can't
00:07:19.270 cheer for it you know forever and I know
00:07:23.770 there's going to be some years when
00:07:25.029 prices are gonna be good
00:07:26.520 prices aren't gonna be good I know those
00:07:27.930 years when yields will be better than
00:07:29.430 others what about the form and if it
00:07:35.069 just and I don't care about economic
00:07:36.840 predictions on or anything the sort I do
00:07:38.819 care that over over the years it's well
00:07:41.310 tended to in terms of rotating crops and
00:07:43.800 I hope yields get better which they
00:07:45.660 generally have in fact that farm a
00:07:49.139 hundred years ago what about wood
00:07:50.940 produced 30 bushels maybe 35 bushels of
00:07:54.840 corn per acre now on a good year you
00:07:57.360 know it'd be 200 I mean we've really
00:08:00.060 made progress in this country that's one
00:08:01.710 reason commodity prices and go back a
00:08:03.240 couple hundred years they've moved so
00:08:04.740 little is because we've just gotten
00:08:06.360 better and better at whether it's cotton
00:08:09.479 or whether it's corn or soy beans are
00:08:11.940 all kinds of things and you and I have
00:08:14.550 benefited from that and so Apple is kind
00:08:17.430 of like a farm well it's a it's a long
00:08:19.949 term investment and if you owned if you
00:08:24.810 own the best auto dealership in town the
00:08:28.020 best brand and had something good
00:08:31.020 running it wouldn't drop by every day
00:08:32.490 and say you know how many people have
00:08:33.750 come in today or you know I think
00:08:35.729 interest rates are going up a little
00:08:37.020 maybe that'll slow down our sales or
00:08:38.760 anyway no you buy it knowing there's 365
00:08:42.390 days a year and you're gonna own it for
00:08:44.610 20 years so that's 70 300 days and you
00:08:46.860 know they're gonna things are gonna be
00:08:48.300 different from day to day and your dear
00:08:50.970 you shouldn't buy it up the day to day
00:08:52.709 stuff that's important let's switch over
00:08:55.560 to talk about buybacks which is another
00:08:58.290 hot topic these days and and you did a
00:09:01.230 fair amount if you look in the annual
00:09:03.180 report you can see that between December
00:09:05.700 13th and 24th it looks like you guys
00:09:09.000 bought back about two hundred and thirty
00:09:10.770 three million dollars worth of berkshire
00:09:12.899 which was right near that particular
00:09:16.050 stock market bottom how did you know
00:09:18.839 that what was going through your mind if
00:09:21.060 I knew it that's not a big purchase for
00:09:25.230 us actually and and now we will by
00:09:28.800 Berkshire only have lots of excess cash
00:09:31.410 all the needs of the business are taken
00:09:33.209 care of we spent fourteen billion
00:09:35.040 dollars on property plant equipment last
00:09:37.260 year
00:09:37.620 way more than appreciation so we take
00:09:39.480 care of the needs of the business then
00:09:40.529 we have excess cash and if we find
00:09:44.210 investment we'd love to do is find other
00:09:46.410 businesses to buy it but if our stock if
00:09:49.500 I think the stock and my partner Charlie
00:09:51.600 Munger think the stock is selling below
00:09:54.270 intrinsic business value we will buy in
00:09:57.300 stock so it obviously was at that point
00:10:00.000 well we thought so yeah yeah but you
00:10:05.610 know what's really intriguing is this is
00:10:07.860 when it goes down a lot I mean when
00:10:10.260 you're buying down our bills for for 60
00:10:12.540 or 70 cents which periodically you get a
00:10:15.330 chance to do in stocks then you know you
00:10:18.120 know it assuming you've got the the cash
00:10:20.760 you know whatever you know get so that
00:10:23.330 that some some surprise could really
00:10:26.790 take you out in some way but if we've
00:10:28.650 got excess cash we'll buy it as fast as
00:10:30.270 we can but at that point it would be
00:10:31.710 more like a 2009 rather than just yes
00:10:34.710 ember yeah but it's you know if you and
00:10:39.690 I own a McDonald's franchise together
00:10:42.480 and it's worth a million dollars and you
00:10:44.070 own 50% of it you come to me and you say
00:10:46.410 I'll sell out for four thousand you know
00:10:48.690 I'll buy you out you say wary of that
00:10:52.410 but tomorrow so just continuing about
00:11:02.010 buybacks Senator Schumer's and Sanders
00:11:04.709 want the government to weigh in to sort
00:11:07.050 of legislate when companies can do
00:11:09.390 buybacks and then also there's was a
00:11:12.690 report recently about executives doing
00:11:15.570 insider trading it appears around the
00:11:18.180 times of buy back so our buybacks are
00:11:20.279 kind of a problem well you'll have some
00:11:22.830 people that misbehave and respect them
00:11:25.350 any activity I made so the really
00:11:28.140 wouldn't have much to do with buybacks I
00:11:29.670 think buybacks the degree to which
00:11:31.709 they've been part of nefarious activity
00:11:34.050 and I've observed them for a lot of
00:11:36.000 years and are very close to zero but
00:11:38.610 that just made me the throne of
00:11:40.740 opportunities but uh that article did
00:11:46.620 not I didn't follow the conclusion on it
00:11:50.490 I mean you're distributing
00:11:51.590 the shareholders essentially in Dubai
00:11:53.990 dividends and presumably American
00:11:55.760 business should distribute money to its
00:11:57.620 owners occasionally and we do it we do
00:12:01.460 it through buybacks or we've done some
00:12:03.800 and we don't do it through dividends and
00:12:06.350 but most companies do it through having
00:12:08.510 a dividend policy and then if they have
00:12:10.670 but he'd be on the needs of the business
00:12:12.440 and I think if their stock is
00:12:14.690 underpriced that it makes nothing but
00:12:17.120 sense should the government tell
00:12:19.160 companies when to do it or at least
00:12:20.960 mandate conditions where they can't
00:12:23.270 well they do restrict you a little in
00:12:25.940 terms of if you're some general rule of
00:12:29.990 the SEC if you're having some kind of
00:12:32.780 this isn't quite the right word but
00:12:34.580 manipulative activity or anything like
00:12:36.560 that in the stock but no I don't think
00:12:38.480 that I don't think the government should
00:12:40.040 decide your dividend policy I don't even
00:12:42.530 think they should direct your capital
00:12:44.360 investments they can make it enticing to
00:12:46.130 make certain kinds of it does capital
00:12:48.590 investments which they do with renewable
00:12:50.780 energy for example I mean the government
00:12:53.030 has interest in fostering certain
00:12:55.910 developments in this country over time
00:12:57.650 and they do there's be a special oil
00:13:01.400 depletion allowance you know 50 years
00:13:03.080 ago and so on that that was more
00:13:05.330 politics than it was governmental policy
00:13:07.430 but certainly renewables are a prime
00:13:09.770 example of that but the idea of decided
00:13:12.290 directing whether you are entitled to
00:13:15.620 return cash to shareholders and the
00:13:19.790 manner in which you do it I don't think
00:13:21.110 really makes a lot of sense the 2020
00:13:23.720 election is going to be upon us before
00:13:25.550 we know it and I know that you had some
00:13:28.490 nice things to say about Mike Bloomberg
00:13:29.870 but it appears he is not going to be
00:13:31.910 running now yeah it's it's hard to win
00:13:33.890 with just a billionaire vote but I
00:13:40.580 admire menorahs me I wish he had run I
00:13:42.950 want to be very clear on that
00:13:44.510 president Trump was a business executive
00:13:46.250 so two questions is a business executive
00:13:48.860 the right kind of person to be President
00:13:50.480 and what characteristics do you look for
00:13:53.690 for a president that you would support
00:13:56.300 well I think a business executive can be
00:14:00.350 the right person but no I don't think
00:14:01.730 that because they're a business
00:14:03.570 that that you give them extra points and
00:14:07.520 number one I want to I want a president
00:14:10.050 that wakes up every morning and and
00:14:12.000 realizes that the greatest threat to a
00:14:15.420 country which has got all kinds of
00:14:16.920 things going for it weapons of mass
00:14:18.930 destruction and that we live in a world
00:14:20.760 where people organizations and
00:14:24.210 occasionally countries could have people
00:14:30.330 that would like to wipe out a large
00:14:31.980 percentage of the American people or
00:14:34.200 maybe other countries as well and that
00:14:36.870 you now have capabilities which I always
00:14:39.720 thought recently I might classify it as
00:14:42.030 a nuclear chemical and biological but I
00:14:43.770 think you have to add cyber now you know
00:14:46.320 you have some evil genius someplace that
00:14:48.780 that crazy reasons just like it happened
00:14:54.930 with anthrax back you know who knows
00:14:57.180 what motivates somebody that starts
00:14:59.100 sending to them anthrax letters and if
00:15:02.520 you have somebody that thinks that'd be
00:15:04.020 great send a false alarm to the Soviet
00:15:07.020 to the Russians and to the US that the
00:15:09.600 other side was launching or something of
00:15:11.250 the sort you know it's it's it's a very
00:15:13.440 very dangerous world it's a wonderful
00:15:16.470 world but it has dangers now that
00:15:19.500 started in August of 1945 and 1/9 Stein
00:15:22.830 said you know this changes everything in
00:15:25.020 the world except how men think and so I
00:15:28.020 want a president that has that same
00:15:30.870 filter that all of these other things
00:15:33.660 are important but protecting the country
00:15:36.780 and reducing the chance of successful
00:15:39.420 use of weapons of mass destruction
00:15:41.550 against us is the number-one job and I
00:15:44.730 think I think most of the presidents
00:15:46.590 I've talked to a couple kumano than over
00:15:48.870 the years and I I really think that they
00:15:51.810 do realize they may get lost in the
00:15:53.610 events of every day as they go along and
00:15:55.950 then beyond that I want a president that
00:15:59.510 has two objectives with the economy one
00:16:02.460 is to make sure that there's marvelous
00:16:04.650 goofs we have keep laying more golden
00:16:07.890 eggs and then I want a president that
00:16:10.620 also feels that if GDP is $60,000 per
00:16:14.340 capita
00:16:15.149 in the United States that nobody should
00:16:17.100 get left behind we've got a market
00:16:19.110 system that works marvelously and
00:16:20.670 turning out more goods and services
00:16:22.699 better ones
00:16:24.329 year after year done it all through my
00:16:26.579 life would you ever talk to a candidate
00:16:28.620 and say hey what do you think about
00:16:30.569 these three things well don't tell me
00:16:34.079 what I want to hear I want to hear what
00:16:36.569 they tell people who disagree with him
00:16:38.370 on the subject I I always like to ask a
00:16:40.980 candidate they usually finessed me
00:16:44.550 somewhere I know but I say what are you
00:16:45.779 for that the majority of your followers
00:16:47.639 are against you know I know you really
00:16:49.620 believe in that and that's reading the
00:16:52.920 test but I'm not sure that except under
00:16:55.470 some kind of sodium pentathol got a
00:16:58.319 great actress that's great but that's
00:16:59.879 the question you ask the presidential
00:17:01.740 candidates or presence that you would
00:17:03.329 speak to it if if I really want to get
00:17:08.339 and then said oh that's why Bernie
00:17:09.630 Sanders was so successful I made 90
00:17:12.750 percent of people who voted for Bernie
00:17:14.189 Sanders had probably not heard of him
00:17:15.659 two years earlier but they felt that
00:17:18.569 they knew exactly they felt they knew
00:17:20.429 exactly what he would do
00:17:21.779 I mean they probably was authentic and
00:17:23.309 and if you asked him you know what he
00:17:27.419 was for that most people might be
00:17:29.880 against he would tell you you know a few
00:17:33.929 questions about Kraft Heinz it was that
00:17:37.049 a mistake but we'll find out overtime
00:17:38.909 but but we did pay too much in my view
00:17:41.279 for for Kraft we didn't pay too much for
00:17:43.919 Heinz so when we started out it was
00:17:47.039 originally a non public partnership
00:17:49.620 between us and and but we did paid too
00:17:53.490 much in my view for Kraft and there's
00:17:55.980 not much you can do about things if you
00:17:57.390 pay too much and secondly there's always
00:18:03.480 been a struggle between the retailer and
00:18:05.490 brands I mean if if I've got a terribly
00:18:08.100 weak brand and I want to get into
00:18:10.409 Walmart I'm not gonna be able to do it
00:18:12.630 you know I mean I offer all kinds of
00:18:14.789 crazy concessions you know that and I
00:18:18.529 want to be in Walmart if I got I have
00:18:21.059 some sort of super packaged goods the
00:18:24.390 negotiation is way different if you have
00:18:26.580 something essential versus not
00:18:27.900 essentially 10 years ago Costco tried to
00:18:31.050 get rid of coca-cola Costco's got
00:18:33.800 terrific loyalty among customers and you
00:18:36.960 know and and their own Kirkland brand is
00:18:39.090 a thirty nine billion dollar brand now
00:18:41.160 and it moved from category to category
00:18:43.410 and they only started in 1992 so they
00:18:46.200 they know brands and they and but in the
00:18:49.620 end they put coca-cola back in if it'd
00:18:53.010 been royal crown Cola had to put it back
00:18:55.590 in so there's always that struggle
00:18:58.650 between the brands I mean and there
00:19:01.290 always will be but the retailer's net it
00:19:05.010 has been moving in their direction
00:19:08.270 particularly I think because of the
00:19:11.420 Amazon revolution first Walmart and then
00:19:15.020 Walmart Walmart yeah yeah but it's been
00:19:19.620 accentuated I think we have a new
00:19:23.880 retailing environment now I mean it it
00:19:26.430 is like it goes from night today but it
00:19:28.320 it moves someone and and brands that
00:19:32.220 people spend billions of dollars
00:19:34.290 developing and sponsoring TV shows or
00:19:36.960 sponsoring radio shows in the old
00:19:38.840 Campbell Soup was always on there with
00:19:41.370 Jack Benny or something you know when I
00:19:42.960 was a kid and it was big and it built
00:19:46.260 brands and people like obviously like
00:19:48.540 the product too but people are more
00:19:51.450 willing to change and it's harder it's
00:19:57.450 it's a somewhat different world than
00:19:59.820 what it is night and day I mean you were
00:20:02.220 very unlikely to keep changing brands
00:20:04.470 every day but it really surprised me
00:20:06.480 that that Gillette lost position I mean
00:20:09.210 I men don't like men don't like to
00:20:11.370 experiment much I move under better
00:20:13.170 experimenting but you know if a kid when
00:20:16.950 you were a kid Gillette cavalcade of
00:20:19.440 sports was your pal and brought you the
00:20:22.050 Rose Bowl and the World Series and all
00:20:24.300 that sort of thing you didn't you just
00:20:26.730 shape would you love the rest of your
00:20:27.900 life and you still do to a great degree
00:20:31.440 but it's not exactly the same as it was
00:20:34.650 even five years ago or so when we bought
00:20:37.110 crafts you mentioned Amazon as a game
00:20:39.810 changer in
00:20:41.140 I have to ask you you haven't bought the
00:20:43.180 stock you're an admirer of Jeff Bezos
00:20:45.040 the listing of the richest people in
00:20:47.680 America came out he's number one I think
00:20:49.720 your friend Bill Gates is number two
00:20:51.310 you're number three so you can see what
00:20:53.590 he's done in myriad ways and of course
00:20:56.320 the question is how come you haven't
00:20:58.300 bought Amazon is there still time to buy
00:20:59.920 would you still buy oh I always admired
00:21:02.830 Jeff I mean I met him 20 years ago or so
00:21:05.680 and and I thought he was something
00:21:09.430 special but I didn't realize you could
00:21:10.930 go from books to it what's happened
00:21:12.850 there no I I mean he had a vision and
00:21:15.450 executed in an incredible way something
00:21:18.760 that would not of you know that but
00:21:22.900 there's a lot of games I miss I would
00:21:24.700 have missed you know I would have missed
00:21:25.690 Microsoft even if I got in to know Bill
00:21:27.460 early or something those just aren't my
00:21:30.100 games I don't worry about the things
00:21:31.300 that I miss that are outside my circle
00:21:33.490 of competence of evaluating I I do I
00:21:37.600 have miss things who are within my
00:21:39.490 circle and that's a terrible mistake
00:21:41.770 those are my biggest mistakes you
00:21:43.690 haven't seen them but I don't it's not a
00:21:46.990 mistake because I miss Netscape or
00:21:48.850 something like that at all there I would
00:21:50.950 say that maybe 5% of the companies or
00:21:53.170 10% of the companies that most are
00:21:54.940 within an area my circle of competence
00:21:57.250 there's something I should be able to
00:21:58.960 understand all right well let me let me
00:22:01.690 switch gears then and ask you about
00:22:03.130 leverage a little bit and corporate debt
00:22:06.070 people are concerned about people are
00:22:07.570 concerned about federal debt at 22
00:22:10.180 trillion dollars should we reduce let's
00:22:14.170 just say the federal debt and how would
00:22:15.520 we do that well if you're running a
00:22:17.700 deficit getting close to 5% when things
00:22:21.520 are really good you know that's a new
00:22:25.600 world I'm and nobody neither the
00:22:28.390 Republicans are Democrats you're
00:22:29.530 particularly concerned about it and
00:22:31.120 we're not having a lot of inflation that
00:22:32.770 wasn't supposed to happen you know but
00:22:34.810 it's happening that's why I say you know
00:22:37.510 really you don't want to get hung up on
00:22:39.870 trying to make economic analysis because
00:22:43.530 nobody's any good go that nobody you
00:22:46.240 don't get rich doing that if you look at
00:22:50.370 invention in that Forbes list if you get
00:22:52.630 on the list the number of people of
00:22:54.450 I've done that by economic analysis I
00:22:56.909 think you're just about as old Shawn
00:22:58.559 there okay fair enough
00:23:00.269 um income inequality wealth inequality
00:23:03.840 you've talked about the Earned Income
00:23:04.919 Tax Credit is there more to it than that
00:23:07.259 should we adjust tax policy it seems to
00:23:09.809 be going the other way right now well
00:23:11.249 it's going the other way but I think I
00:23:12.779 think I think the Earned Income Tax
00:23:15.059 Credit is the best way to put money in
00:23:20.399 the pockets of people that don't fit
00:23:22.019 well into the market system but that are
00:23:24.059 perfectly decent citizens and that have
00:23:26.039 made a good bit of the success of
00:23:28.019 somebody like I've had with Berkshire or
00:23:29.850 something possible it wouldn't have
00:23:31.289 happened without the America we have and
00:23:33.809 if you go back go back 200 years and
00:23:38.820 we're all working out 80 percent of us
00:23:40.470 are working on farms the person that's
00:23:42.869 the best of that working in that farm
00:23:45.200 whatever it may be
00:23:47.700 is worth maybe twice the ones that's the
00:23:51.359 worst you know I mean that's the
00:23:53.100 difference between super talent and no
00:23:55.379 talent in the farm economy picking
00:23:57.720 cotton or whatever it may be now if
00:24:00.809 you're the best
00:24:01.970 middleweight fighter in the world you
00:24:04.019 know you may get twenty or thirty
00:24:05.190 million dollars and and and if you are
00:24:08.940 just a good citizen raise nice kids
00:24:11.639 helping the neighborhood and everything
00:24:13.350 else but you don't have market related
00:24:15.690 skills you'd be you'd be good on that
00:24:17.759 farm stone and you would be earning
00:24:20.039 something comparable but most of the
00:24:21.450 people around you but you don't have
00:24:23.999 something out of it as it gets more and
00:24:25.799 more specialized and it's going to
00:24:27.059 continue to get more specialized you
00:24:29.340 want two things for that person you want
00:24:31.649 them have a decent life I mean they live
00:24:33.840 in a country with 60,000 of GDP per
00:24:36.210 person you want them to you want them to
00:24:38.460 have a decent life and they can I also
00:24:42.299 think you want them to have a feeling of
00:24:44.070 accomplishment so you wanted to have a
00:24:46.109 job assuming that they're not
00:24:47.639 handicapped in some way you wanted to
00:24:49.379 have a job but the minimum wage would be
00:24:52.559 one way and say well we'll make sure
00:24:54.690 that they haven't I'm wearing their
00:24:55.710 pocket but that's got a lot of effects
00:24:58.619 in disturbing the market system they
00:25:01.019 just need more cash they don't need a
00:25:03.239 higher wage they need more cash in their
00:25:05.279 pocket and and the government at a
00:25:07.080 relatively local
00:25:08.610 come provide a decent living friendly
00:25:11.730 but it's living that's working forty
00:25:14.430 hours a week and has a couple of
00:25:16.170 children and we've gone in that
00:25:18.660 direction and it's sort of bipartisan
00:25:20.730 and you find both Republicans and
00:25:22.830 Democrats for it I think it would be
00:25:24.960 better not to have one annual payment
00:25:27.450 you know how'd that they get it monthly
00:25:29.400 and I think there are various things you
00:25:31.260 could do but you want it you want them
00:25:33.120 to feel part of the system and you want
00:25:35.250 to get them have them get as as more and
00:25:38.070 more of these golden eggs or like you
00:25:39.390 want them to get get get a little more
00:25:41.610 of their share I mean if we don't do
00:25:43.320 that and the Democrats win it's possible
00:25:46.080 we get you know big taxes on wealthy
00:25:49.050 people free college for all and and
00:25:52.350 those are bigger plans you want you want
00:25:54.570 more money in the pockets of every and
00:25:56.400 everybody's willing to work or is unable
00:25:58.920 to work and and we can do it a rich
00:26:01.260 family would do that you know I had six
00:26:03.960 or seven kids and I had some business I
00:26:05.460 wanted to pass on you know you'd pick
00:26:07.140 the most able person or mother because
00:26:08.640 that's the market system to do that but
00:26:10.530 you make sure that on all seven of the
00:26:11.970 family participated you didn't get more
00:26:14.280 than the one that you might give more to
00:26:15.840 the one that that that kept producing
00:26:18.240 the golden eggs you would but you
00:26:21.110 wouldn't just say to the other the one
00:26:23.640 at the lowest end who might be the best
00:26:26.040 kid of all and in most respects you know
00:26:28.320 he's the one that shares with everybody
00:26:32.120 you wouldn't it would say to that
00:26:34.850 Emperor that you know too bad that's
00:26:37.590 just the way the market system works you
00:26:39.120 know go guy your have your spouse get a
00:26:43.500 job for housing someplace right why
00:26:49.590 don't we do update about the health care
00:26:51.900 initiative which now the company has a
00:26:54.540 name yeah we're Haven was that your idea
00:26:56.580 no no I didn't worry about a name we
00:26:59.790 could have gone on there's no name
00:27:01.920 operation for ten years
00:27:04.880 now that that is we got a wonderful
00:27:09.350 partnership in the sense that it's got
00:27:12.350 law its large and has reasonable market
00:27:15.169 muscle with them more than a million
00:27:17.539 employees one of the three of us we've
00:27:20.090 got three CEOs that can make things get
00:27:22.309 done in organizations so are so big that
00:27:24.799 normally that they would get very
00:27:27.529 bureaucratic on a I mean if you try to
00:27:30.409 do this with many big companies you have
00:27:33.139 it up legal weighing and then you know
00:27:35.870 and and and public relations where you
00:27:38.149 know we don't have any of that stuff
00:27:39.500 they may have them in certain areas but
00:27:41.870 but I don't but Jamie isn't worried
00:27:44.029 about doing that sort of thing and then
00:27:47.029 neither is Jeff so so we've got a unity
00:27:49.730 of commitment and an ability to execute
00:27:53.750 on the commitment the only problem is
00:27:55.370 you've got a three point four trillion
00:27:57.529 dollar industry which is as much as the
00:27:59.360 federal government raises every year
00:28:00.830 that that basically is feels pretty good
00:28:03.710 about the system they as we went around
00:28:06.019 talking to people to find a leader for
00:28:09.860 the group for example you know everybody
00:28:11.750 says you know the system you know it
00:28:14.690 turns out very good medicine but you
00:28:17.330 can't go from five percent of GDP to 18
00:28:19.610 you know without without really making
00:28:23.299 it less competitive of among other
00:28:24.710 things in the world so everybody thought
00:28:26.450 the system needed some adjustment just
00:28:28.519 not their portable system had and that's
00:28:30.919 very human I do the same thing I'm sure
00:28:32.690 if I was in the same place so it's
00:28:34.549 there's an enormous resistance to change
00:28:37.820 while a similar acknowledgement the
00:28:41.029 change is will be needed and of course
00:28:44.240 if the private sector doesn't supply
00:28:46.820 that over a period of time you know
00:28:49.159 people will say them you know we give up
00:28:51.950 we gotta turn those over they got ruined
00:28:53.779 which will probably be even worse how
00:28:56.720 often do you talk to Jamie and Jeff
00:28:58.340 about it I know Todd combs I think that
00:29:00.019 Roger God really does all the work at
00:29:02.539 our but if this works you have the
00:29:05.330 credit from the from the berkshires dad
00:29:07.519 boys does Haven have to buy companies to
00:29:09.590 gain expertise and what do you know it
00:29:12.460 no I I noticed the plan I mean Eddie the
00:29:15.649 plan is support
00:29:18.500 a very very very good thinker on this
00:29:21.950 subject who's once is a practicing
00:29:25.450 physician and who commands the respect
00:29:28.460 of the medical community to in effect
00:29:33.799 figure out some way so that we can
00:29:36.610 deliver even better care and have people
00:29:42.230 feel better about their care too I mean
00:29:45.080 they have to perceive that they're
00:29:47.480 receiving better care over time and and
00:29:50.090 and stop the march upward of cost
00:29:54.169 relative to the country's output we've
00:29:56.480 got this incredible economic machine but
00:29:59.510 but we shouldn't we shouldn't be
00:30:02.480 spending eighteen percent when other
00:30:04.640 countries are doing something pretty
00:30:06.890 competent terms of doctors per capita
00:30:09.730 hospital beds per capita not the very
00:30:12.409 top stuff in medicine I think is very
00:30:15.020 much concentrated in this country and
00:30:16.909 and that's great I want us to be the
00:30:18.799 leader but I just don't I think we're
00:30:20.840 paying a price if we're paying seven
00:30:22.730 extra points of GDP that's 1.4 trillion
00:30:27.110 a year yeah is the administration
00:30:30.309 focusing by focusing on drug prices is
00:30:33.200 that sort of a rabbit hole as I'm
00:30:35.600 missing the big I mean they they're
00:30:38.240 trying and and and and Congress
00:30:41.539 generally I mean talk the average
00:30:43.390 congressman they read they regard as a
00:30:47.000 problem and they made and they see
00:30:50.870 specific instances you know of drug
00:30:53.630 prices or something like that but it's a
00:30:58.190 big problem to change I mean the trouble
00:30:59.809 is it intersects in so many ways and
00:31:02.029 that and that's why we've got quantity
00:31:05.960 heading it and we've got three bigger
00:31:08.210 sized organizations backing him we're
00:31:10.100 not trying to do it to make money I mean
00:31:11.840 that is not a goal that we end up with
00:31:13.610 some business that that we make money
00:31:16.070 off of and will he be talking to health
00:31:18.260 insurers for instance well he'll be
00:31:20.539 talking to everybody but it's it is his
00:31:25.520 game plan is not something we're trying
00:31:27.110 to try and lay out because it it's in
00:31:29.270 his head to some degree I mean I
00:31:31.640 we selected him by by hearing and
00:31:34.630 reading and so on what he's done but
00:31:39.650 he'll learn is we always work well we
00:31:41.840 will conduct certain experiments or he
00:31:44.059 will you know and and try out a
00:31:46.040 community where one of us has a lot of
00:31:47.960 employees maybe in their various ways to
00:31:50.299 experiment shifting gears where do you
00:31:53.870 find things like that Abe Lincoln tail
00:31:56.450 and leg quotes I mean you read
00:31:58.820 Bartlett's book of quotations probably
00:32:02.960 fifty years ago I looked at a few
00:32:04.190 Bartlett's quotations but but I mean I
00:32:06.140 read a lot and if you just remember
00:32:08.840 these things and apply for 88 years you
00:32:13.370 don't know what happened yesterday but
00:32:14.480 you remember the old stuff business
00:32:19.210 you've got a lot of interesting
00:32:21.049 quotations in your head that's great
00:32:25.130 okay so one company who invested in was
00:32:28.400 GE yeah and you did well with that
00:32:30.320 investment and yeah I was too early
00:32:32.600 actually if you look back I was very
00:32:36.919 active in the last half of September and
00:32:40.309 early October and then I wrote that
00:32:41.840 article in later October and I knew it
00:32:44.900 was gonna get bad I wrote the articles
00:32:46.460 gonna get bad but I didn't think the
00:32:47.750 stock market would react as much as it
00:32:49.940 did between then and March so I had more
00:32:54.410 or less used up our powder well before
00:32:58.250 the bottom was hit
00:33:00.200 that's interesting how have you avoided
00:33:02.510 not getting back into GE more recently I
00:33:05.960 mean I'm sure that they've reached out
00:33:07.400 to you everyone says so what does it
00:33:08.990 Warren Buffett invest in GE and save it
00:33:10.880 and take it to the promised land this
00:33:12.110 great American company well actually I
00:33:14.600 think Larry actually doing a good job
00:33:17.030 there Colton's the Danaher yeah there we
00:33:19.460 go but to Danaher is a good sale and I
00:33:23.210 think he's his priorities are straight
00:33:25.160 and I think he's very able guy and he's
00:33:27.320 on the right track and I'm a I'm a fan
00:33:29.030 of G ease in the sense that that we're a
00:33:33.320 big buyer from him we're a big seller to
00:33:35.270 him knowing the managers you know I mean
00:33:37.970 Jack Welch is a very good friend of mine
00:33:39.919 we don't agree on politics I never said
00:33:41.900 but we have a lot of fun together I love
00:33:44.030 it
00:33:44.270 so I've got a great desire for GE to do
00:33:47.150 well it hasn't it just hasn't looked
00:33:49.250 that attractive to me right you talked
00:33:53.030 about the growth of trees and letters
00:33:55.280 shareholder one was the third Grove
00:33:58.130 which was sort of the in between stakes
00:34:00.470 the equity interests yeah is it is it
00:34:03.679 the case that those are sort of not the
00:34:06.230 healthiest grove of trees and all I
00:34:08.540 would that be no the pilot Flying J
00:34:10.879 where you know they're they're companies
00:34:12.949 that under GAAP accounting we have to
00:34:15.320 record under an equity method we own
00:34:17.330 more than twenty percent but we don't
00:34:18.830 control them and so it's it it's treated
00:34:21.800 under GAAP accounting is a special
00:34:23.210 category and and and it it didn't fit
00:34:26.570 well when the other grow so I had to
00:34:28.070 make it a separate grow by itself it's
00:34:30.199 not it's not it's not that significant a
00:34:31.879 growth you say that the the some of
00:34:34.369 Berkshire is has a greater valuation
00:34:36.918 than the part is true
00:34:37.940 did you ever try to calculate that how
00:34:39.350 much is that well it depends on
00:34:41.360 circumstances I mean there's some times
00:34:42.949 when the flow from insurance can be very
00:34:45.320 valuable there sometimes when the
00:34:47.389 ability to use production tax credits
00:34:51.379 will say in the utility business but
00:34:53.300 have them on our as part of our
00:34:55.280 consolidated return helps but that
00:34:57.590 varies a lot but it is a plus and we can
00:35:04.609 move capital well take a business like
00:35:07.460 See's candy which we bought 40 odd years
00:35:09.560 ago it's a wonderful little business it
00:35:12.410 throws off of capital we've tried 50
00:35:13.940 different ways to expand you graphically
00:35:15.950 do all kinds of things it doesn't work
00:35:17.630 and we'll try it again and it won't work
00:35:19.460 but we can move that capital to buy help
00:35:23.690 by BNSF railroad or do all kinds of
00:35:27.260 other things so we've got a seamless and
00:35:30.050 and and and tax efficient way a moving
00:35:34.490 capital words needed and we've got some
00:35:38.150 companies that really chew up capital
00:35:40.280 and we got others that kick it off and
00:35:41.570 and we can move it from one one pie if
00:35:45.109 you try to do that with your investments
00:35:47.359 that you incur some taxes as you go
00:35:50.000 along doing it and it's less efficient
00:35:52.940 than what we've done you talked a lot
00:35:55.010 about the
00:35:56.210 tax cuts and the benefits to Berkshire
00:35:58.400 you didn't really get into the costs of
00:36:00.619 the tax cut which surprised me a little
00:36:03.560 bit what are the are their costs I mean
00:36:05.450 is it just free money well it makes a
00:36:08.330 difference the tax cut we get for
00:36:11.510 example our utilities as I mentioned in
00:36:13.460 the report that goes to the customers
00:36:15.170 that's just the nature of utility
00:36:16.609 regulation but but net we were a
00:36:19.339 significant beneficiary from the tax I
00:36:23.270 mean basically let's just say we had one
00:36:26.420 class of stock we got two but it's not
00:36:28.339 you and I own a business together and we
00:36:32.720 think we own all the stock but the truth
00:36:34.640 is before the tax cut the government had
00:36:36.859 a 35% share of the stock on income no I
00:36:41.480 didn't have a share of the assets but
00:36:43.040 had a share the income and if it want to
00:36:44.570 change it to fort it could have changed
00:36:45.859 it but fortunately it changed it to 21
00:36:47.830 and if we had a private business if we
00:36:50.869 had a mcdonald franchise together or an
00:36:52.580 auto dealership together you know the
00:36:55.520 third shareholder that invisible
00:36:57.230 shareholder the governor just handed us
00:37:00.140 back a bunch of the shares of stock and
00:37:01.910 and and went and our shareholders
00:37:04.670 benefited a lot of other shareholders
00:37:06.170 benefit right you talked about Ajit Jain
00:37:09.650 and Gregg Abel saying that Berkshire
00:37:11.510 blood flows through their veins have
00:37:14.690 they made a difference since they become
00:37:17.780 vice chairs and then are they like
00:37:20.030 Warren and Charlie no they don't they
00:37:23.210 don't have the interaction and they each
00:37:25.820 run a separate business inside and she
00:37:28.760 does not think about the other
00:37:29.900 businesses he thinks about the insurance
00:37:31.280 business and Gregg does not think about
00:37:32.960 the insurance business at all and and I
00:37:36.170 think about the money and the capital
00:37:38.060 and so on but they running two very big
00:37:43.490 businesses I mean a Jeets business you
00:37:45.830 know as you go all told at least a
00:37:51.070 couple hundred billion of assets you
00:37:53.570 know and and and Greg's business has a
00:37:57.170 hundred and fifty billion of revenues I
00:37:59.300 mean these are they both would fit up
00:38:01.369 there toward the top ten you know or so
00:38:04.099 in the country in terms of value so
00:38:07.930 maybe the top 15
00:38:10.160 but they're they're very big businesses
00:38:12.320 but they're not exactly like you to guys
00:38:14.570 it's oh no no no Charlie and I have a
00:38:16.369 partnership think about the whole place
00:38:18.890 and we've done it forever you know and
00:38:20.540 and we still do and Todd and Ted I
00:38:23.510 didn't see them mentioned well they they
00:38:25.550 they they they have 13 billion dollars
00:38:28.970 each including pension funds that are
00:38:31.970 pension funds that they they run and and
00:38:36.070 saw 173 billion we had at year-end in
00:38:41.230 equities they had well we got on in 73
00:38:45.500 Buffy had another 8 billion in pension
00:38:47.480 funds over 180 years old
00:38:49.190 they had 26 between them that their
00:38:51.050 manager they got total discretion on
00:38:52.760 that they don't ask me at the month end
00:38:55.280 I look and see what they did they they
00:38:57.020 don't do much they don't do a lot of
00:38:58.130 trading or anything but I I look to see
00:39:00.080 what changes they made and and Todd for
00:39:04.160 example I mean he made a couple of small
00:39:07.310 investments in in private placement type
00:39:10.450 operations and I know what the
00:39:14.330 businesses do but I can't tell you their
00:39:15.560 names
00:39:15.920 you know maybe was one of those you made
00:39:20.240 this investment in Oracle and then you
00:39:21.710 sold it was that something they did and
00:39:23.540 no that was not something they did that
00:39:24.980 was something I did yeah and you said
00:39:26.450 you didn't understand it that's why you
00:39:27.890 saw both and why'd you get it in the
00:39:29.000 first yeah well that's that's a good
00:39:30.770 question which I do not ever go to
00:39:32.270 answer I know I I seat about I know
00:39:38.450 enough about the club to know I don't
00:39:40.130 know enough about the cloud right okay
00:39:42.980 um so Barclays put out a note they said
00:39:46.700 they were lowering the estimates for
00:39:48.440 Berkshire for the EPS do you read that
00:39:51.710 stuff no well I mean I may read it
00:39:54.890 actually that money but I don't see it
00:39:56.720 out to read out put it that way
00:39:58.250 but there it just doesn't make any
00:40:00.500 difference at all I mean if I spent time
00:40:04.070 reading that I wouldn't have a time to
00:40:05.300 read ten case and we're not going to do
00:40:08.660 anything different I don't know what
00:40:10.550 we're gonna learn as I put in the annual
00:40:12.260 report and I really think this is unique
00:40:14.900 I mean we do not prepare financial
00:40:18.530 statements monthly for Berkshire and
00:40:21.820 there's no other company would do it
00:40:23.410 there but there's no sense doing it I
00:40:24.700 know I know where the money is and I
00:40:26.380 know what I know how the companies are
00:40:27.790 doing generally but what difference does
00:40:29.620 it make because I'm not gonna try and
00:40:31.060 hit any number for the quarter by you
00:40:33.580 know having a sale on insurance or doing
00:40:36.040 something even worse so it and Charlie I
00:40:41.620 mean he he knows he knows where we stand
00:40:43.750 and we know what businesses are doing
00:40:46.030 well Wishart and we certainly know where
00:40:47.860 the money is another one UBS survey of
00:40:51.400 Berkshire investors says the five most
00:40:53.380 important things to them are succession
00:40:55.450 investment performance ma opportunity
00:40:57.580 share repurchase insurance margins do
00:41:00.760 you read that all but I don't disagree I
00:41:03.700 mean I'm glad somebody understands us
00:41:06.240 your own investors yeah
00:41:08.800 well that's important 54 well to go back
00:41:13.000 to when I started my partnership in 1956
00:41:15.610 that Berkshire came out of there were
00:41:17.950 seven people sitting there at a table
00:41:20.010 having dinner relatives primarily and I
00:41:24.850 said here's the partnership agreement
00:41:26.670 it's done under Nebraska law that's four
00:41:29.590 or five pages you don't need to read it
00:41:31.210 but I said here's a little half page
00:41:34.360 what I call the ground rules and I want
00:41:37.180 you to read these and if you feel okay
00:41:39.640 about that about the interaction what
00:41:42.610 the expectations are and all of that
00:41:44.380 sort of thing then we'll join forces and
00:41:46.870 if you don't it's fine that other people
00:41:48.850 you know but we don't we shouldn't be
00:41:50.620 partners I mean you know if I'm gonna
00:41:52.480 have a partnership with somebody I want
00:41:53.800 to be compatible it is you know it and
00:41:55.720 when you have a public company you can't
00:41:59.800 control who comes in I can't control
00:42:01.540 some guy that comes in and thinks we
00:42:03.250 were gonna pay big dividends they're
00:42:04.390 supposed to stock or something like that
00:42:05.500 so by by actions and my communications
00:42:09.340 and everything I want to attract the
00:42:11.380 people that from the public market that
00:42:15.340 I want and I want to keep the others
00:42:17.260 away Costco was built Saul Price who
00:42:20.530 started the price Club that thing he sat
00:42:23.200 down and figured out the customer he
00:42:24.850 didn't want and he set up a system that
00:42:27.700 would keep away the customer didn't want
00:42:29.440 who did not want he didn't want somebody
00:42:31.240 buying a quart of milk with somebody
00:42:33.070 behind him with a
00:42:34.250 with a basket $200 worth of goods
00:42:36.470 waiting for that so we put it in a
00:42:38.390 membership fee and by putting in a
00:42:39.830 membership fee he killed all the drop in
00:42:42.080 business-to-business to belong to the
00:42:43.790 7-eleven we want Bircher don't to keep
00:42:47.960 out people who have expectations about
00:42:50.510 us that are different than ours I mean
00:42:52.640 good for them and I hope they find
00:42:54.410 somebody they fit but if you're gonna
00:42:57.140 run a church you want you want your
00:42:59.750 seats to be filled by people that are
00:43:01.190 generally want to listen to hear form of
00:43:03.859 religion that and you don't want it to
00:43:05.570 change every week and say gee I need a
00:43:07.369 new group and I'll go out and talk to a
00:43:08.810 bunch of investors and get them to come
00:43:10.220 to my church this sunny because there's
00:43:11.720 only so many seats in the church there's
00:43:13.580 a million six hundred forty five
00:43:15.290 thousand or so a equivalent shares and
00:43:17.990 those are the seats and I want them
00:43:19.670 occupied by people that are on the same
00:43:21.950 page I am the Church of Berkshire your
00:43:26.240 seems like you've got a big waiting in
00:43:27.950 financials and of course you've finally
00:43:29.690 invested in Jamie diamonds company why
00:43:33.080 banks right now they're businesses I
00:43:36.590 understand and I like the price at which
00:43:39.140 they're selling relative of their future
00:43:40.700 prospects I think 10 years from now that
00:43:43.160 they'll be worth more money and I feel
00:43:45.140 it's a there's a very high probability
00:43:47.270 I'm right and I don't think there will
00:43:50.210 turn out to be the best investments at
00:43:51.680 all you know the whole the whole panoply
00:43:55.099 of things you could do but I'm pretty
00:43:58.070 sure that they won't disappoint me its
00:44:00.470 climate change changing your insurance
00:44:02.450 businesses now it doesn't change the
00:44:04.099 insurance business does it change
00:44:05.619 modeling or something in the business no
00:44:07.760 it would change our insurance business
00:44:09.320 writing 20-year policies I mean if there
00:44:11.750 was something that changed life
00:44:12.950 mortality adversely to the interests of
00:44:16.640 live insurance coming here stuck with a
00:44:18.140 policy for 20 years if you write the
00:44:19.760 life insurance policy and that's you
00:44:21.589 know you you'll be paying your premiums
00:44:23.570 of its adverse to me that's what's
00:44:24.950 happened in long-term care insurance for
00:44:26.630 example but when you write a policy free
00:44:30.200 one year at a time you see what the
00:44:33.589 developments are and if you know it cars
00:44:36.320 for example are much safer to drive than
00:44:39.740 they used to be there used to be 15
00:44:41.210 deaths per 100 million miles driven now
00:44:43.430 there's a little over 1 on the other
00:44:45.349 hand they've become much more expensive
00:44:47.330 to
00:44:47.780 fix I'm in that little little side right
00:44:50.120 side do marry which I used to cost ten
00:44:52.910 bucks you know
00:44:53.450 now thousand bucks or something like
00:44:55.250 that so so you have things that are
00:44:57.890 changing in terms of if you're writing
00:45:00.670 collision experient insurance you got a
00:45:03.680 allow for the fact that that that that
00:45:05.950 windshield the bumper all kinds of
00:45:08.930 things are the the side view mirror and
00:45:10.610 all that their way their marksmanship
00:45:12.040 but if you're writing if your writing
00:45:14.450 liability you know that the that people
00:45:17.510 aren't gonna die as often they're so
00:45:19.370 climate changes like a climate car has
00:45:22.190 been changing but that the truth is that
00:45:24.560 you now can buy really big catastrophe
00:45:29.920 limits cheaper than you could buy them
00:45:33.770 in 2005 or there abouts allowing for
00:45:38.480 changes in the dollar and and and
00:45:40.670 concentration of population so so so far
00:45:43.400 rates have come down that's the reason
00:45:45.140 we've gotten out of the cat business to
00:45:47.000 a great degree we were the we were a
00:45:48.350 very big writer of cat business ten or
00:45:50.690 twelve years ago we aren't out of the
00:45:52.280 cat business because the climate change
00:45:53.690 we're because the prices aren't right
00:45:55.160 and the world will change and it's got
00:46:00.770 very serious consequences but but it
00:46:03.620 won't change that much from year to year
00:46:05.750 that you know we've done very well
00:46:08.930 during a period of some climate change
00:46:11.230 you've talked about technology advancing
00:46:14.150 faster than our ability to understand it
00:46:16.970 and I'm wondering if social media and
00:46:20.180 Facebook and Google and Russian trolls
00:46:23.180 coming in and is that maybe an example
00:46:25.760 of that are you still worried about that
00:46:27.170 problem well I think cyber poses real
00:46:31.190 risks do you matter II forgetting about
00:46:33.620 the problems even misinformation I'm
00:46:36.440 just thinking of you know we have
00:46:39.520 railroads running over 22 thousand miles
00:46:42.170 of track and some of them are carrying
00:46:43.700 ammonia and some of them return you know
00:46:45.290 chlorine and things we have to carry him
00:46:47.240 we have no choice about that number
00:46:48.680 required by law to carry him and you
00:46:52.430 know I would rather I would rather do
00:46:54.830 that in a non cyber world in a cyber
00:46:56.720 world and I would there are all kinds of
00:46:58.670 things I the problem by something like
00:47:00.410 cyber is
00:47:01.460 that it's it's moving and it's it's just
00:47:05.750 unpredictable whether you'll get some
00:47:08.170 crazy guy like suck the anthrax in there
00:47:11.180 you know what they can do becomes
00:47:13.849 magnified I mean when when when you saw
00:47:16.910 what you know 19 guys didn't you know
00:47:20.200 9/11 I mean it had tools in the hands or
00:47:26.630 potentially in the hands of either crazy
00:47:29.630 individuals crazy groups or even a few
00:47:33.920 crazy governments you know are really
00:47:35.450 something and and and and we don't
00:47:37.849 necessarily know what all the tools I
00:47:39.530 have are and that is moving all the time
00:47:43.250 I mean you know again Einstein said he
00:47:46.040 said I know not with what what
00:47:48.260 but what weapons World War 3 will be
00:47:51.589 felt thought but World War 4 will be
00:47:54.859 fought with sticks and stones you know I
00:47:56.930 mean it's it's a dangerous world I don't
00:48:00.410 know if you've been following this warn
00:48:02.240 but what do you think of Elon Musk's
00:48:04.990 behavior as a CEO well I think it has
00:48:08.599 room for improvement he yeah and he
00:48:13.670 would say the same thing just some
00:48:19.700 people have a talent for interesting
00:48:22.970 quotes and others others have a little
00:48:25.579 bit more of a blocker up there that says
00:48:26.990 this key and a problem and but he's he's
00:48:30.619 a remarkable guy but I don't see I just
00:48:37.579 don't see the necessity to communicate
00:48:39.859 you know I've never I I think I've got
00:48:42.770 seven tweets because a friend of mine
00:48:44.780 signed me up for it and she's called me
00:48:48.260 about a hundred times say can i tweet
00:48:49.910 this or that and I said yes two or seven
00:48:52.040 times I guess or something like that i
00:48:53.780 I've never actually written one myself I
00:48:55.910 I don't even know how to do it
00:48:58.490 have you talked to Elon ever I joined
00:49:01.849 The Giving Pledge so I have once or
00:49:03.740 twice that that's a lot of years ago uh
00:49:06.520 seven or eight years ago I'm not I mean
00:49:09.410 he hasn't come to our annual gathering
00:49:11.569 so I haven't seen him for seven or eight
00:49:13.130 years
00:49:13.730 so let's talk about this this trade war
00:49:17.720 that's been going on a little bit with
00:49:19.040 China and I guess I'd like to ask you do
00:49:21.770 you think that Donald Trump was right in
00:49:23.570 calling out the Chinese government and
00:49:25.730 basically putting them on notice I won't
00:49:28.100 have any comment on that in terms of
00:49:33.290 political activity I don't put my
00:49:38.570 citizenship in a bind a blind trust so
00:49:40.670 when the election comes around now other
00:49:43.460 hand people will interpret things I say
00:49:47.240 about any any president you know as to
00:49:51.050 some extent coming from Berkshire and
00:49:52.370 they'd and they don't come from
00:49:53.570 Berkshire I'm just an individual so I I
00:49:57.790 you know I think I'm glad to talk about
00:50:01.220 China but like I can't talk to you about
00:50:02.960 that part of it fair enough I mean do
00:50:04.940 you think there was room for improvement
00:50:06.500 then in terms of the trade relationship
00:50:08.510 between China and the United that China
00:50:12.530 and the United States absolutely
00:50:15.620 destined to be the superpowers you know
00:50:18.400 beyond my great-grandchildren lives and
00:50:22.790 and will always have be competitors and
00:50:27.560 will be competitors and in business
00:50:30.560 working with letters and ideas all kinds
00:50:32.810 of ways and there's no other way it
00:50:35.780 would be and we just have to make sure
00:50:37.970 that that competition doesn't yet get us
00:50:44.780 to a point where we don't realize that
00:50:46.760 the best world is one in which both the
00:50:49.250 United States and China prosper I mean
00:50:51.140 we do not want to have an island of
00:50:53.570 prosperity in the rest of the world
00:50:55.840 envious of us in a nuclear age and and
00:51:00.070 China doesn't Russia doesn't I mean we
00:51:03.200 all recognize the dangers of letting
00:51:05.570 competition get out of control and and
00:51:08.750 and become you can you can be
00:51:11.000 competitors without being enemies and
00:51:12.950 and that's that's what all powerful
00:51:16.760 nations have to realize over time I mean
00:51:19.100 it's different than 200 years ago when
00:51:20.930 you could have some dominant country and
00:51:24.350 then they may have done some things
00:51:27.650 didn't like but it didn't threaten the
00:51:29.240 existence of the world you really
00:51:30.620 threaten the existence to the world as
00:51:33.530 we know it
00:51:34.160 if important countries do not constantly
00:51:39.590 recognize that they can compete and they
00:51:41.540 can fight over certain things but they
00:51:44.300 can't regard to this essentially the
00:51:47.120 equivalent of war here's a question from
00:51:49.610 Kevin Chen who is a Berkshire
00:51:51.290 shareholder and an NYU professor and he
00:51:54.290 says and this is sort of a long in lies
00:51:55.850 what you were just saying Warren but do
00:51:57.530 you think that US and China will be able
00:51:59.270 to resolve their differences or our
00:52:01.610 conflicts unavoidable well I don't think
00:52:04.130 conflicts are unavoidable but I think I
00:52:06.050 think it has to be active thinking on
00:52:10.280 the part of every hugely powerful
00:52:13.820 country and Russia is hugely powerful I
00:52:16.670 mean 90% of the nuclear arms in the
00:52:18.590 world between US and Russia so they they
00:52:23.060 have to recognize that the best world
00:52:26.330 for them is one where they don't try and
00:52:30.410 grab all the apples basically and we
00:52:32.870 have to recognize that and we can't in
00:52:36.170 the United States we can't think that
00:52:38.600 either our ideas run the world you know
00:52:41.120 or we start getting aggressive about
00:52:45.650 things and China can't think that and
00:52:47.120 Russia can't think that and and that's
00:52:50.660 obvious you just have to make things you
00:52:53.690 gotta be sure things don't escalate
00:52:56.260 world war one you know with an Archduke
00:52:58.910 you know I mean you get you get these
00:53:00.560 can get chance incidents and and you
00:53:03.200 really want to I asked one of the
00:53:05.780 presidents one time but you know in
00:53:07.190 terms of what he would do if awakened in
00:53:09.500 the middle of the night was somebody
00:53:11.600 coming to him and saying absolutely and
00:53:14.810 on something they also launched on would
00:53:17.570 you launch on that and you've got 10
00:53:20.510 minutes at the side and I wouldn't want
00:53:23.870 to have that responsibility but but
00:53:25.550 you'll want to make sure you don't get
00:53:27.470 to that point right right
00:53:29.240 would you ever make a big acquisition in
00:53:31.640 China and if not aren't you missing a
00:53:34.220 huge portion of the answer is we would
00:53:37.550 no we would have you looked Oh
00:53:41.599 we've been made aware of things some
00:53:43.459 things yeah are you concerned on the
00:53:46.579 flip side of the coin are you concerned
00:53:48.049 that they're the rule of law is
00:53:49.699 different that the accounting might be
00:53:51.919 opaque well I'd want to be sure I
00:53:55.009 understood the accounting obviously some
00:53:57.199 businesses that'd be easier to do than
00:53:58.699 others but but I know the laws the
00:54:04.369 customs the accounting the people better
00:54:10.909 in the United States that I place else
00:54:12.380 so there's some small hurdle in in many
00:54:17.959 countries to get over which I can get
00:54:20.149 over I mean but but I just don't it's
00:54:22.279 just not as easy as looking at something
00:54:23.989 where I already know the answer you know
00:54:25.579 from previous transactions or something
00:54:27.679 of the sort so so it's easier to make a
00:54:32.929 big acquisition in the United States not
00:54:35.269 to do more work if I'm looking beyond
00:54:38.599 the borders but I love the idea of doing
00:54:40.459 it
00:54:40.939 when we made the acquisition Israel a
00:54:43.880 dozen years ago and I didn't know what
00:54:45.829 the tax rates were there I didn't I
00:54:48.049 didn't know what corporate law you know
00:54:49.759 I was I I suspected that it would all be
00:54:52.639 answered satisfactorily which it was but
00:54:55.999 I didn't just automatically know it it
00:54:58.130 seems like you're more open about doing
00:55:00.679 a deal in China than in previous
00:55:02.409 conversations I don't think so no I know
00:55:07.339 I I'm open yeah we made you know we made
00:55:13.029 two decent-sized stock acquisitions
00:55:16.549 there and that worked out fine those are
00:55:18.259 well PetroChina Andy why do you idea yes
00:55:20.899 yeah me whitey was Charlie's but
00:55:22.399 Charlie's yeah very well-versed on China
00:55:24.549 um the the trade the US trade deficit
00:55:27.919 has been widening and of course a lot of
00:55:30.349 that has to do with our trade with China
00:55:33.169 is that something that worries you well
00:55:35.869 I wrote an article about it for fortune
00:55:37.399 and the the trade situation many years
00:55:39.439 ago and wondering what our deficit got
00:55:41.419 to be large in relation P I don't think
00:55:45.049 it's I don't think it's a essential
00:55:46.939 level trade balance but I I think that a
00:55:50.119 trade deficit gets large and and it
00:55:54.439 looks like you have no
00:55:55.610 way out from it that that can be a real
00:55:59.030 problem over time I mean you know you're
00:56:00.950 you're shipping little pieces of paper
00:56:02.660 to the rest of the world and they're
00:56:04.610 shipping you goods I mean people are
00:56:06.500 working making underwear or shoes
00:56:08.120 someplace and they get little pieces of
00:56:09.950 paper from us and it gets very tempting
00:56:13.760 if you've done that enough to make sure
00:56:16.250 that those little pieces of paper aren't
00:56:17.780 worth very much overtime when they want
00:56:20.150 to cash up for something so and you
00:56:22.820 don't want to have we don't have any
00:56:25.010 problem running trade deficits but but
00:56:27.830 if we ran really large ones and we sort
00:56:30.650 of worked ourselves into a box where
00:56:32.150 they were we didn't really have a
00:56:35.300 solution to get the numbers down it
00:56:38.180 could be a problem and I wrote about it
00:56:39.950 one time but it's it's kind of a nice
00:56:45.800 thing actually just I mean wouldn't you
00:56:47.600 like to have something where you should
00:56:48.770 just have little pieces of paper and
00:56:50.090 somebody keeping supplying it was there
00:56:51.770 food or yes okay and last question China
00:57:01.610 is facing its slowest growth in nearly
00:57:03.770 three decades the leadership they're
00:57:05.420 lower the targets I think to around six
00:57:08.000 point five percent six percent are you
00:57:10.760 concerned about this slowing growth and
00:57:12.560 the impact on global markets well I
00:57:15.320 don't worry about in terms of global
00:57:16.760 markets I mean I China's gonna grow a
00:57:18.620 lot over time I mean they when you think
00:57:22.370 of what's happened was in 1949 or where
00:57:26.240 you know but there's been nothing really
00:57:28.940 like it I mean he had 20% of the world's
00:57:35.000 population at that time perhaps and
00:57:38.750 although really hadn't remotely achieve
00:57:42.110 their potential I mean that the
00:57:43.310 intellectual capacity they had decent
00:57:46.640 soil all kinds of things I mean and and
00:57:49.100 and what's happened there almost is
00:57:52.340 beyond belief and and that game's not
00:57:55.040 over but we've had incredible
00:57:57.080 developments in the United States I mean
00:57:59.000 you know real GDP per capita is six
00:58:02.900 times what it was the day I was born
00:58:05.000 in the United States six times and we
00:58:08.030 thought we were pretty
00:58:09.140 I'm country that everything no my
00:58:12.140 parents wouldn't believed it I mean they
00:58:13.700 they wear the thought you know this kid
00:58:16.250 has really got it made
00:58:18.430 it was true I mean we had this tailwind
00:58:21.019 and and China's had a hurricane mine
00:58:23.930 that you know and in the in recent
00:58:26.240 decades in a good way
00:58:27.799 absolutely because you were comparing to
00:58:30.140 the tailwind yeah hurricane over back
00:58:32.059 yeah at their back and at and and
00:58:34.809 they've they have found a way of life
00:58:39.079 that is dramatically different then
00:58:41.990 existed for the billion there was a
00:58:44.180 billion then maybe maybe a billion two
00:58:46.039 or whatever it is now and and they have
00:58:48.890 changed a country really of sizes I
00:58:53.750 don't think it's ever been anything like
00:58:54.980 it we've done it too but it took a
00:58:58.660 somewhat longer I mean it more stretched
00:59:01.309 out but it was a remarkable period but
00:59:03.200 but you know when you go to my first
00:59:07.549 went there in 1995 and then they
00:59:12.140 regarded as a miracle then I went back
00:59:13.960 it was a whole different country beyond
00:59:16.099 that Oh Warren Buffett thanks so much
00:59:18.829 for joining us
