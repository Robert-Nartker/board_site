00:01:53.079 reasons why business owners typically
00:01:55.079 struggle to minimize their tax burden
00:01:57.439 effectively understanding these will
00:01:59.520 give us context for the rest of our
00:02:01.240 discussion reason number one business
00:02:03.759 owners are often uncertain about where
00:02:06.320 to start many entrepreneurers are simply
00:02:08.720 not confident about how to take the
00:02:10.800 first right step in complex tax planning

00:02:28.599 that need to be considered to build a
00:02:30.239 comprehensive and reliable tax strategy
00:02:33.000 and finally reason number three business
00:02:34.879 owners tend to spend too long trying to
00:02:36.519 figure it out all by themselves only to
00:02:38.680 realize that without professional
00:02:40.480 guidance they are likely leaving money
00:02:42.319 on the table and potentially exposing
00:02:44.640 themselves to unnecessary risks I'm
00:02:46.760 going to put myself out there and say
00:02:48.560 you like many other business owners are

00:03:15.599 complex but that's because they are
00:03:17.319 powerful tools that go beyond basic
00:03:19.159 deductions if you're ready to hear about
00:03:21.200 these you are in the right place by the

00:03:44.400 to move taxes from your high tax bracket
00:03:47.640 to a 0% tax bracket now what we're not
00:03:50.760 going to be covering isn't basic
00:03:53.079 writeoffs that the standard business
00:03:54.640 owners already know you know simple
00:03:56.680 entity formation advice or generic tips
00:03:59.040 about keeping Good Records those Basics
00:04:01.840 are important but they're just
00:04:03.200 scratching the surface we are here to
00:04:05.280 dive into strategies that can
00:04:06.799 potentially save you tens of thousands
00:04:09.000 in taxes that are easy to follow and
00:04:11.280 understand no matter what your level of
00:04:13.480 of knowledge is so let's get into it the
00:04:16.079 first strategy I want to talk about
00:04:17.519 today is the 14-day home rental role or
00:04:20.040 the Augusta role and this is really for
00:04:22.199 small business owners that have a
00:04:24.440 separate physical entity that they and
00:04:26.800 they're also utilizing their home
00:04:28.720 infrequently less than 14 days for
00:04:30.600 business purpose now this is separate
00:04:33.600 from a home office so think of things
00:04:35.440 like maybe you're hosting a retreat for
00:04:37.240 your business at your house or maybe
00:04:38.440 you're having clients over or team
00:04:39.759 members staying over or maybe you're
00:04:41.520 hosting or doing something in a
00:04:43.080 different part of your house separate
00:04:44.120 from your home office that is just
00:04:46.039 infrequent oneoff type things and that's
00:04:48.120 where the home office or the 14-day home
00:04:49.840 rental rule works and basically how the
00:04:52.240 strategy works is that the IRS says that
00:04:54.000 if you rent your de your house your
00:04:55.639 personal residence for 14 days or less
00:04:58.680 you do not have to pay taxes on that
00:05:01.000 income that you received from that
00:05:02.240 14-day home rental now you also don't
00:05:05.160 get expenses from that from that 14-day
00:05:07.120 home rental but you don't pay taxes on
00:05:08.800 that income that we received from it and
00:05:10.880 so we flipped the switch and say how can
00:05:12.440 we rent our home to our business for
00:05:14.800 business related items and how can we
00:05:16.800 get a business deduction and due to the
00:05:19.600 tax code have to pay no income taxes on
00:05:22.440 that so this is a strong opportunity to
00:05:24.919 get a business deduction and pay no
00:05:26.600 taxes on that money that we're receiving
00:05:29.080 for that now the piece here is correct
00:05:31.759 implementation because there's a lot of
00:05:34.120 people that take the strategy and abuse
00:05:35.800 it they say well I'm just going to rent
00:05:37.280 my my house for 14 days quotation marks
00:05:40.520 I'm just going to rent out my house for
00:05:41.479 14 days $1,000 a day and move on and
00:05:43.639 that's it they're not having any
00:05:44.960 documentation they're not having any
00:05:46.319 proof there's nothing to back it up
00:05:48.080 about it so we need to make sure that
00:05:49.720 we're doing this strategy correctly we
00:05:51.680 need to make sure we're dotting our eyes
00:05:52.919 and crossing our teas and documenting
00:05:55.600 the business purpose and everything
00:05:57.080 that's around with it and so this is a
00:05:58.800 strategy that I see so many business
00:06:00.199 owners miss out on it's also a strategy
00:06:02.560 that I see abused and so the key thing
00:06:05.080 is is we want it today let you
00:06:07.479 understand what is the strategy how do
00:06:09.240 we do it but also making sure that we do
00:06:11.360 not abuse it because if we abuse it well
00:06:13.680 then we're taking a strategy that is in
00:06:15.039 the tax code clear and written and
00:06:17.400 making it illegal because we're abusing
00:06:19.639 the strategy so how do we do it some of
00:06:21.759 the required items to implement the
00:06:23.599 strategy is you need to have an actual
00:06:25.960 rental reason so are you renting this
00:06:28.720 house do you have maybe team members
00:06:30.560 that instead of putting up putting them
00:06:32.120 up in a hotel you're going to have them
00:06:33.599 at your house or do you have clients
00:06:35.120 that instead of putting them up at a
00:06:36.360 hotel you're going to have them at your
00:06:37.319 house are you maybe hosting a retreat or
00:06:39.639 maybe a marketing presentation that
00:06:41.080 you're bringing everybody to your house
00:06:42.960 are you maybe doing uh you know what
00:06:44.479 I've done in the past is I've done a
00:06:46.400 summit a digital Summit but I did it in
00:06:48.880 a different room in my house because I
00:06:50.120 wanted a good backdrop and all these
00:06:51.479 lighting and different things we brought
00:06:52.800 in for it that was a reason for me to
00:06:54.800 utilize the strategy so we need to have
00:06:56.440 a legitimate rental reason to be renting
00:06:59.160 our house to our business and we want to
00:07:01.160 keep documentation proof of that rental
00:07:03.720 reason the next piece is we need to find
00:07:06.160 out a reasonable rental rate so we can't
00:07:09.039 say well we're just going to rent out
00:07:10.160 our house for $1,000 a day instead of
00:07:12.560 putting a team member up in a hotel that
00:07:14.800 doesn't make sense but let's look in the
00:07:17.160 local area how much does it cost to have
00:07:19.560 a to to rent out uh to have a what is
00:07:22.280 the typical Hotel rate for a for a night
00:07:25.599 stay well maybe that's our reasonable
00:07:27.680 rental rate if you're having a board
00:07:29.599 meeting at your house which we recommend
00:07:31.520 business owners have board meetings on a
00:07:33.080 regular basis whether it's monthly
00:07:34.560 quarterly annually something like that
00:07:36.039 but if you're having a board meeting at
00:07:37.280 your house how much would it cost to
00:07:39.280 rent out a boardroom at a local
00:07:40.879 co-working space or a local hotel let's
00:07:43.599 find that rate and back up the proof and
00:07:45.199 that's the rate that we use so we need
00:07:46.599 to have a rental reason and we need to
00:07:48.520 have a reasonable rate that matches that
00:07:51.000 rental reason the next thing we want to
00:07:52.879 do is we want to execute a lease
00:07:54.680 agreement so a lease agreement between
00:07:56.599 our business and our personal reference
00:07:58.400 about what is that lease for we need to
00:08:00.840 make a payment from for the lease from
00:08:02.800 the business to us personally at the end
00:08:05.479 of the year we need to process at $199
00:08:07.199 for that rent that we paid from our
00:08:08.840 business $10.99 from our business to our
00:08:11.240 personal we're going to zero that out on
00:08:13.000 the personal tax return because remember
00:08:14.639 because of the tax code if it's if the
00:08:17.159 personal residence was rented out for 14
00:08:18.919 days or less we do not pay taxes on that
00:08:21.080 so even though we're showing that as
00:08:22.159 income from that 1099 we're going to
00:08:24.000 zero out on our personal tax return due
00:08:25.680 to the tax code and we want to make sure
00:08:27.400 that we have all of this documentation
00:08:30.080 on file this can be a super powerful
00:08:33.440 strategy now let's go through a use case
00:08:36.120 where we often see this and where a lot
00:08:37.440 of people do this is they'll hold
00:08:38.880 monthly board meetings for their
00:08:40.080 business so they'll bring in people that
00:08:41.599 are on their board that might be family
00:08:42.919 members that's close advisers to them
00:08:44.560 might be friends might be people that
00:08:45.839 are close to their business and are part
00:08:47.680 of their board their Board of advisers
00:08:49.839 or their board of directors and they
00:08:51.519 might host an Ann a monthly board
00:08:53.640 meeting and let's say they called around
00:08:55.320 in a local co-working space that a
00:08:56.760 boardroom is going to cost $500 per day
00:08:59.560 and so they say okay we're going to rent
00:09:01.160 out we're going to document that proof
00:09:02.640 of that local rate and we're going to
00:09:05.040 rent out we're going to do a monthly
00:09:06.120 board meeting at our house and the
00:09:08.160 rate's going to be $500 a day we're
00:09:09.720 going to put all the documentation the
00:09:11.480 meeting minutes all that's going to be
00:09:12.680 on file and if we did that $500 a day
00:09:16.200 for 12 month for 12 days which is one
00:09:18.560 day per month that's a total of
00:09:20.600 $6,000 that's the power behind that's
00:09:22.720 $6,000 business deduction and that's
00:09:25.200 $6,000 that you're not paying taxes on
00:09:27.600 when it comes through to you personally
00:09:29.600 so that's the power of the 14-day home
00:09:31.079 rental role or the Augusta rule strategy
00:09:33.480 two we want to talk about is setting up
00:09:35.399 an accountable plan and this is
00:09:37.000 specifically for S Corp owners or CC
00:09:39.120 Corp owners and basically an accountable
00:09:41.360 plan is a way to reimburse yourself for
00:09:43.959 business related items that you paid for
00:09:45.760 personally now what we're always going
00:09:47.320 to say is if it's a business related
00:09:48.959 item just pay for it out of the business
00:09:50.959 of course but sometimes there's a
00:09:53.160 business and personal mix so there's
00:09:54.640 items that are both personal mix and
00:09:57.360 they have a business use to them so we'd
00:09:59.120 say run that pay for that personally but
00:10:00.920 then have the business reimburse you for
00:10:03.519 that of course if you accidentally make
00:10:05.279 a business expense on your personal
00:10:06.640 account you can use an accountable plan
00:10:08.320 for this but it's important to have an
00:10:10.720 accountable plan set up because if you
00:10:12.600 don't set it up correctly that payment
00:10:15.360 from the business to you could be
00:10:17.040 taxable income if you don't have the
00:10:18.680 proper setup in that payment can be
00:10:21.040 taxable income to you and so the most
00:10:23.920 you know the the the most typical areas
00:10:26.279 that we seen a Comal plan come into
00:10:27.600 place is home office deduction obviously
00:10:30.480 so many business owners should be taking
00:10:31.839 advantage of the home office deduction
00:10:33.200 and it is available to many more
00:10:34.920 business owners than than many think but
00:10:37.600 a home office is something that you're
00:10:39.079 paying for personally you this house
00:10:41.000 that you're in the utilities that's a
00:10:43.880 lot of personal use in there as well
00:10:46.040 there's just a business portion of it
00:10:47.720 and so we're going to pay for that house
00:10:49.480 those mortgage and all those different
00:10:50.680 things personally but then we need to
00:10:52.440 reimburse ourselves from the business
00:10:53.839 for the business use for that home
00:10:55.440 office use is going to be a
00:10:56.880 reimbursement from the business to us
00:10:58.800 personally in order to successfully do
00:11:00.680 that to ensure that the business gets
00:11:02.079 adduction and it's taxfree to us we need
00:11:04.720 to have a properly set up accountable
00:11:06.720 plan in place and so any es Corp if
00:11:08.720 you're set up as an S corporation which
00:11:10.360 so many business owners are or should be
00:11:12.519 you need to have an accountable plan set
00:11:14.480 up to make sure that this reimbursement
00:11:16.680 the iris cannot come in and make it
00:11:18.639 taxable so how do you do that first we
00:11:21.560 need to adopt a written reimbursement
00:11:23.920 policy or a written accountable plan
00:11:26.160 it's something we set the parameters on
00:11:27.760 what are we reimbursing how fre are
00:11:29.720 reimbursing set all the parameters on
00:11:31.560 that sign it put it on our corporate
00:11:33.760 documents we're not sending this to the
00:11:35.200 IRS we're not doing anything like that
00:11:36.399 but we want to have it on file in case
00:11:38.240 the IRS ever came knocking the next
00:11:41.240 piece to it is that we want an
00:11:42.880 accountable plan template or an expense
00:11:45.040 report that indicates what is the
00:11:47.399 business reimbursing us for if it's the
00:11:49.360 home office we want to show how are we
00:11:50.800 calculating that if it's personal use of
00:11:52.959 an automobile we want to show how are we
00:11:54.920 calculating that if it's a cell phone
00:11:56.720 internet utility all these different
00:11:58.360 things we need to have an expense report
00:12:00.279 or an accountable plan template that
00:12:02.040 shows what that reimbursement amount is
00:12:04.360 coming from and then finally we need to
00:12:06.160 make that reimbursement we need to B the
00:12:07.680 payment from the business account to our
00:12:09.600 personal account and again if we set
00:12:11.320 this up correctly we have the expense
00:12:13.199 report correctly done it's a business
00:12:15.199 expense and it's not taxable income to
00:12:17.720 us let's go through a use case we one of
00:12:20.199 our clients we talked about Alex had an
00:12:22.199 automobile that he owned personally but
00:12:24.199 he was using a lot for his business he
00:12:26.720 had a home office that he was using a
00:12:28.360 lot for his business he had cell phone
00:12:30.079 that was mostly business internet that
00:12:31.720 was a lot of business use for it and he
00:12:34.120 was thinking I'll just take these
00:12:36.160 deductions on there without an
00:12:37.560 accountable plan in place but the
00:12:38.760 problem is is the obiously come knock
00:12:40.519 and say hey you don't have a properly
00:12:42.120 set up accountable plan in place and
00:12:43.880 that means that those reimbursements
00:12:45.240 that you're making to yourself are
00:12:46.680 taxable income sure you get a business
00:12:48.600 deduction but it's taxable income to you
00:12:51.120 but if we properly put accountable plan
00:12:53.160 in place and we properly make the
00:12:54.880 reimbursements now that business expense
00:12:57.959 that that payment that we're making for
00:12:59.279 that reimbursement for that automobile
00:13:01.079 that home office that cell phone that
00:13:02.639 internet it's a business deduction and
00:13:04.880 it's not taxable income to us and so in
00:13:06.959 Alex's case we saved over $4,500 taking
00:13:09.560 advantage of the accountable plan as
00:13:11.320 well as the expenses inside of it that
00:13:13.160 automobile home office in so many
00:13:15.040 different other opportunities this is a
00:13:17.240 strategy that every single S corporation
00:13:19.519 owner should be
00:13:21.240 utilizing strategy number three is
00:13:23.880 Advanced strategies for high income
00:13:26.079 earners so who is this for typically
00:13:28.760 what we put into that high income earner
00:13:30.839 bracket is those with household income
00:13:33.320 of $350,000 or more now that could be
00:13:36.199 from W2 income business income or a
00:13:39.000 combination of the two but if you have
00:13:41.199 income in that $350,000 or more that's
00:13:43.959 where we start to look into Advanced Tax
00:13:46.680 Strategies and now there's a lot of
00:13:48.320 different areas that we can get into it
00:13:50.000 and these Advanced Tax Strategies tend
00:13:51.480 to bring with them some more rest but
00:13:53.120 let's look at one let's look at a
00:13:54.720 leverage charitable strategy now there's
00:13:57.519 a lot of different opportunities here
00:13:58.800 but in in a very easy to understand way
00:14:01.399 let me explain to you how this works
00:14:04.000 let's say that you bought uh a stock for
00:14:07.079 $100 you bought it four years ago a
00:14:09.440 stock for $100 you paid $100 you
00:14:11.600 purchased the stock and now today it's
00:14:13.480 worth $500 well the IRS code says if you
00:14:16.839 contribute that stock to charity you can
00:14:19.399 get a deduction for its value today its
00:14:21.399 fair market value today so even though
00:14:23.880 you only paid $100 for the stock if it's
00:14:26.440 now worth $500 and you donate that stock
00:14:29.399 to charity you're going to get a charal
00:14:31.240 deduction for $500 not what you paid for
00:14:33.959 it as $100 and so that's this idea of a
00:14:36.279 leverage chable strategy now again
00:14:38.160 there's different ways that we can do
00:14:39.720 that in different types of products and
00:14:41.360 and and uses for that but that is one
00:14:43.600 strategy that we like to utilize for
00:14:45.639 high income earners other times it might
00:14:47.920 be an investment you're making an
00:14:49.279 investment in maybe a business or maybe
00:14:52.279 equipment and equipment rental and
00:14:54.759 you're getting big depreciation UPF
00:14:56.600 front that can be used to offset some of
00:14:58.079 your other income or maybe it's an
00:14:59.759 investment in a solar project and you're
00:15:01.440 using solar creds and various different
00:15:03.120 activities to offset your income again
00:15:05.120 when we look at these Advanced
00:15:06.199 strategies there's a lot of different
00:15:07.399 plays and a lot of different turns that
00:15:09.279 we can take with it now the importance
00:15:11.880 or the the important piece when we talk
00:15:13.600 about Advanced strategies is correct
00:15:15.680 implementation because as you know this
00:15:18.160 provides some massive tax savings and
00:15:20.920 anytime you have a strategy that
00:15:22.240 provides massive tax savings it can
00:15:24.360 bring about it abuse and so whenever
00:15:26.720 you're trying to implement an advanced
00:15:28.399 tax strategy we need to make sure that
00:15:29.560 we're working with a vendor an
00:15:31.199 investment provider whatever it might be
00:15:33.079 that we know like and trust that we
00:15:34.800 believe they're doubting their eyes and
00:15:36.360 crossing their te that they're doing
00:15:37.800 everything possible to ensure that this
00:15:39.360 thing is risk-free from an audit
00:15:41.319 standpoint and if it did go to audit
00:15:43.000 that it can be defended and taken to
00:15:44.720 court with it and so that is part of
00:15:47.240 what we do at taxel we connect with
00:15:49.000 these Partners we do our due diligence
00:15:51.000 so we can bring what we believe our
00:15:53.000 vetted trusted opportunities to you now
00:15:56.199 my opinion on these Advanced Tax
00:15:57.519 Strategies is yes they do bring with it
00:16:00.360 some risk to them because the IRS is
00:16:02.519 targeting things that save massive
00:16:04.360 points of taxes but if we say our theory
00:16:07.160 is is that if we can defend this if we
00:16:09.079 can find the tax code that this makes
00:16:11.480 sense for and that we can defend we can
00:16:13.560 feel comfortable doing it but it does
00:16:15.639 bring with it some risk so how do we do
00:16:18.199 this how do we get into Advanced Tax
00:16:20.319 Strategies first we need to find a
00:16:22.399 trusted vendor whether it's an
00:16:23.920 investment whether it's a a leverag
00:16:26.680 charitable deduction whether it's an
00:16:28.360 investment in solar whether it's
00:16:29.920 investment in oil and gas whether it's
00:16:31.560 an investment in equipment or some other
00:16:34.079 type of business we need to find a
00:16:35.920 vendor or a product that we know like
00:16:37.839 can trust and that we know are doing
00:16:39.480 things the right way you know used case
00:16:42.079 on this is we're just working with a
00:16:43.519 client of ours or a member of tax they
00:16:45.839 combined both a leveraged charitable
00:16:48.199 strategy as well as a business
00:16:50.079 investment and they saw in year one over
00:16:53.040 $250,000 in tax savings that's how
00:16:55.959 powerful the strategy can be again if
00:16:59.000 we're doing it correctly if we're
00:17:00.040 dotting our eyes and crossing our teas
00:17:01.279 on this strategy strategy number four is
00:17:03.440 this idea of a short-term rental or more
00:17:06.039 specifically the short-term rental
00:17:08.319 loophole and who is this for this is for
00:17:11.079 business owners or individuals that are
00:17:13.359 looking for a tax deduction but also
00:17:15.359 interested in investing in real estate
00:17:17.760 and basically how a short-term rental
00:17:19.959 loophole works is there's a code in the
00:17:22.039 IRS code that says if you rent your if
00:17:25.520 you if you have a rental property and
00:17:27.160 the average stay is 7 days or less
00:17:29.760 the IRS is not going to look at that
00:17:31.520 rental property as a passive activity
00:17:34.240 and to give you an idea typically
00:17:35.559 passive activities if we have losses
00:17:37.559 from passive activities we can't utilize
00:17:40.080 those losses to offset ordinary income
00:17:43.320 W2 income business income but if we can
00:17:45.760 turn those passive activities into
00:17:47.760 non-passive then if they create a loss
00:17:50.520 then we can utilize them to offset our
00:17:52.120 W2 income our business income and so
00:17:55.080 this is the power with the short-term
00:17:56.280 rentals the typical rental property if
00:17:58.240 you're investing a long-term rental
00:17:59.880 typically that's going to be a passive
00:18:01.120 activity and so if it's creating losses
00:18:02.760 due to depreciation in early years you
00:18:05.159 can't use utilize those losses to offset
00:18:07.640 your ordinary income but if it qualifies
00:18:09.760 as a short-term rental you can and what
00:18:12.080 qualifies as a short-term rental the
00:18:14.320 average rental period has to be 7 days
00:18:16.600 or less now it doesn't mean you can't
00:18:17.919 have a rental period over 7 days it just
00:18:19.440 means the average total stays divided by
00:18:21.799 total days rent has to be an average of
00:18:23.400 seven days or less now there is not only
00:18:26.520 a tax opportunity here a tax play but
00:18:29.039 there's also a real wealth building
00:18:30.880 opportunity available for this now this
00:18:33.880 is another thing that we want to be
00:18:35.159 important of because there's risks
00:18:36.640 sociated with this you could invest in
00:18:38.799 uh what we call a lemon property or a
00:18:40.720 property that is not successful or maybe
00:18:42.720 you invest in a property that you want
00:18:44.000 to do a short-term rental with but its
00:18:45.840 location doesn't even allow short-term
00:18:47.760 rentals so you need to make sure that
00:18:49.240 you're dotting your eyes and crossing
00:18:50.240 your teas on your investment the
00:18:51.679 properties that you're choosing but my
00:18:53.640 belief is that this is not only a
00:18:56.039 short-term rental but real estate in
00:18:57.480 general can be an extremely powerful
00:18:59.720 strategy that not only helps you build
00:19:01.640 your wealth but can give you extreme tax
00:19:04.039 benefits in the front end so how do we
00:19:06.039 do this how do we Implement a strategy
00:19:07.679 like this first we need to find a
00:19:10.080 property so we need to find out okay
00:19:12.120 where do we want this property to be how
00:19:13.919 do we want to invest in it what's that
00:19:15.320 going to look like you know how much are
00:19:16.960 we putting down how much are we taking a
00:19:18.200 loan out doing all these different
00:19:19.280 things once we find that property we
00:19:21.679 need to start putting it into practice
00:19:23.559 we need to start renting out that
00:19:25.200 property and we need to ensure that our
00:19:27.320 average rental day for the year
00:19:29.240 is 7 days or less once we've
00:19:32.159 accomplished that we can utilize a cost
00:19:33.919 segregation study that's going to help
00:19:35.760 us accelerate a lot of the depreciation
00:19:38.200 from the purchase of that building it's
00:19:40.000 going to accelerate it up into year 1 2
00:19:43.080 3 4 5 and so on so we're going to take a
00:19:45.120 lot of that depreciation that normally
00:19:46.480 would be spread out over 39 years and
00:19:48.559 we're going to bring it all in on the
00:19:50.240 heavy end or a good portion of it in on
00:19:52.240 the heavy end and that's going to create
00:19:54.120 a loss in that entity then we can
00:19:56.320 utilize that loss from that short-term
00:19:58.000 rental to offset our ordinary income our
00:20:00.400 W2 income our business income again this
00:20:02.840 can be an extremely powerful strategy to
00:20:05.240 help offset some of your income finally
00:20:08.679 strategy five and this strategy is
00:20:10.400 hiring your children so who is this for
00:20:12.559 typically we say those that have
00:20:13.720 children between the ages of around
00:20:15.360 seven and 18 and how this works is that
00:20:17.799 you can get a business deduction and
00:20:19.679 your kids potentially pay no income
00:20:21.799 taxes on that so let's say you hire your
00:20:23.799 kids in your business and the kids are
00:20:25.440 doing work for your business we need to
00:20:26.840 we'll talk about this in a little bit
00:20:27.960 but they need to be doing actual work
00:20:29.120 and doing all these different items but
00:20:30.840 we can hire our kids in our business and
00:20:32.400 if we're paying them out of a sole
00:20:33.600 proprietorship or a single member LLC we
00:20:36.240 can pay them out of our business we
00:20:38.039 don't have to withhold for f tax or
00:20:39.679 Social Security Medicare and if their
00:20:41.760 income is under the standard deduction
00:20:44.480 they pay no income taxes on this so this
00:20:46.679 is an opportunity where we can pay our
00:20:49.840 kids get a business deduction reduce our
00:20:52.600 taxable income on our high tax bracket
00:20:54.760 and that income goes to them and they
00:20:56.120 potentially pay no income taxes on that
00:20:58.080 at a zero % bracket imagine if you're in
00:21:00.360 the 37% tax bracket you go from 37% tax
00:21:03.280 bracket that money that you're paying
00:21:04.480 your kids down to zero now if you don't
00:21:06.919 implement this you're losing out on
00:21:08.320 these opportunities because guess what
00:21:10.120 I'm a parent I know you if you're a
00:21:12.159 parent you are spending money on your
00:21:14.000 kids every single day you're sending
00:21:16.520 them to basketball camps baseball camps
00:21:18.440 amusement parks with friends you're
00:21:20.000 doing all these extracurricular spending
00:21:21.799 on your kids but how can we find a way
00:21:24.080 to get a business deduction for it and
00:21:25.840 move money from our tax bracket to our
00:21:28.760 tax bracket now of course there are some
00:21:31.400 risks with this and there's abuse your
00:21:32.880 kids have to actually be doing work for
00:21:34.360 you so if you're like oh yeah I'm just
00:21:35.720 going to pay my kids I'm going to pay
00:21:36.880 them up to the standard deduction and
00:21:38.279 take full advantage of this we need to
00:21:40.279 make sure that we're doing this
00:21:41.440 correctly we need to make sure our kids
00:21:43.120 are actually doing work for us we're
00:21:44.559 paying them a rate that's relative to
00:21:46.480 those types of things and so my belief
00:21:48.600 is that nearly you can find a way to pay
00:21:50.520 your kids now you might not be able to
00:21:51.679 Max it out you might not be able to pay
00:21:53.480 the full amount that you want to but I
00:21:55.559 believe that every business should be
00:21:57.880 able to hire their every business should
00:21:59.520 be able to hire their kid some way
00:22:01.120 within their business now it might be
00:22:03.320 you know doing social media it might be
00:22:05.320 shreding paper it might be cleaning the
00:22:07.039 office it might be stuffing envelopes
00:22:08.480 there might be all different types of
00:22:09.799 activities but I think that you should
00:22:11.600 be able to hire your kid in some way
00:22:13.520 within your business so how do you do
00:22:15.520 this first we typically say the kids
00:22:17.640 should be at least 7 years old and we
00:22:19.600 say that because that's what tax case
00:22:21.720 has supported now we see some people do
00:22:23.720 less some people you know have have
00:22:25.840 valid reasons you just need to D your
00:22:27.480 eyes especially care with that now so
00:22:30.200 typically we say kid has to be at least
00:22:31.520 7 years old the work that they're doing
00:22:33.880 within your business has to be directly
00:22:36.000 related to your business so they have to
00:22:37.559 be doing actual work for your business
00:22:38.880 we can't just say oh yeah we're going to
00:22:40.480 pay our kids for our chores and that
00:22:42.480 just helps us work more on our business
00:22:44.039 because they're doing chores instead of
00:22:45.279 bothering us when we're working our
00:22:46.480 business no no no no no that doesn't
00:22:48.080 work they need to be doing actual work
00:22:50.279 for your business and we need be we need
00:22:52.679 to be paying them a reasonable wage
00:22:54.559 based on what they're doing for our
00:22:56.039 business so we need to be paying them a
00:22:58.159 wage based on what they're doing that's
00:22:59.520 reasonable we can't just say we're going
00:23:01.000 to pay our kid $133,000 a year and move
00:23:03.520 on no we need to find out okay what are
00:23:05.559 they doing how much time are they
00:23:06.720 putting in what is a reasonable rate to
00:23:08.760 pay for someone doing that and you also
00:23:10.559 need to take into consideration their
00:23:12.520 experience so if our kids cutting lawn
00:23:14.559 in our office we're not going to pay
00:23:16.120 them the same amount that we'd pay a
00:23:17.240 professional to do it because they're 10
00:23:18.559 years old and maybe they don't have that
00:23:19.840 full experience or if our kids doing
00:23:21.640 social media we're not going to pay them
00:23:23.279 as much as we'd pay a social media firm
00:23:25.320 that is experts in this so we pay them a
00:23:27.440 reasonable rate based on the work
00:23:28.720 they're doing the hours they're putting
00:23:29.919 in as well as their experience then we
00:23:32.760 want to keep a time sheet what are they
00:23:34.559 doing when are they doing it that
00:23:36.360 matches up with our payments to them
00:23:38.320 finally we need to pay our child by
00:23:39.960 check or direct deposit or something
00:23:41.480 directly into an account in our child's
00:23:43.760 name and we need to make sure that we
00:23:45.440 don't use this money for Parental
00:23:46.840 obligations so we can't take this money
00:23:48.919 and say hey now go buy us food go buy us
00:23:51.360 groceries go pay us rent to stay with us
00:23:53.559 we can't be doing things like that but
00:23:55.159 parental obligations would not be
00:23:56.880 sending someone to a baseball camp
00:23:58.440 sending somebody to an amusement park
00:24:00.080 for their friends so there's lots of
00:24:01.440 opportunities and different planning
00:24:02.799 cases in this we also talk about using a
00:24:04.799 Roth and various different cool things
00:24:06.919 for this so let's go for a use case a
00:24:09.000 client that we've actually seen
00:24:09.960 implement this and again we recommend
00:24:12.120 and say that majority of businesses
00:24:13.799 should be able to if you have kids in
00:24:15.000 that range should be able to find
00:24:16.559 something to at least start to scratch
00:24:18.320 the surface on this strategy but we had
00:24:20.640 a client that had age kids age 14 and 16
00:24:23.799 he paid them each around $122,000 per
00:24:25.799 year now it wasn't exactly 12 but based
00:24:27.840 on the work they doing everything else
00:24:29.200 within the business that was around
00:24:30.120 $112,000 a year and that brought them
00:24:32.399 Savings of over
00:24:34.440 $9,000 again this is the opportunity to
00:24:36.559 move money from get a business deduction
00:24:38.840 for it and your kids potentially pay no
00:24:40.520 income tax on that money that they
00:24:42.520 received so with that being said most of
00:24:45.279 the basic tax software programs out
00:24:47.320 there won't give you this level of sop
00:24:50.120 sophisticated tax planning so if any
