What happens when the world of accounting meets the world of fintech? Sparks fly! 

Together, they're rewriting the rules and creating something entirely new. Fintech is shaking up traditional accounting, turbocharging everything from automated bookkeeping to real-time insights. It's not just about crunching numbers anymore — it's about smarter, faster, better ways to serve clients.

Thanks to the explosion of digital financial tools, the fintech market is on fire, set to hit over $340 billion this year. And accounting firms? They're diving in headfirst, using fintech to boost efficiency, cut down on errors and wow their clients with next-level services.

p18iuhvdfs4mlim23i41s379fpd.jpg
This got me thinking about what an accounting firm and fintech merger might look like. Picture it: It's a wedding for the ages. The two unite their superpowers, walk down the aisle, say "I do," and boom! They've created the ultimate power couple in the financial world.

And it doesn't stop there. Pretty soon, they've got a baby on the way. But not just any baby — this kid is changing the game. Curious what this little genius looks like? Let's find out … .

A digital prodigy. The kid's first words were "cloud-based platform!" This baby lives online, where clients can manage finances, talk to their accountant and use cutting-edge fintech tools all in one place. Everything's connected with APIs that keep data flowing smoothly. No hiccups. No drama.
An advisory superstar. This baby knows that data is just the beginning. They use their combined DNA to offer next-level advisory services. Think strategic financial planning, real-time insights and proactive problem-solving. Whether it's forecasting growth or navigating tough decisions, they're always ready with tailored advice that makes clients feel confident and empowered.
A born collaborator. This kid's got the best of both parents. From mom (the accounting firm), they get trust and personalized advice. From dad (the fintech), they get speed, innovation and a love of automation. Together, they're unstoppable — a client-first powerhouse that's always aligned.
A custom creator. There are no off-the-shelf solutions for this baby. They're all tailored fintech tools designed just for accounting workflows, like compliance checks that run themselves or dashboards that actually make sense. Smart and efficient, just like their parents.
A charismatic host. This kid throws the best parties — a.k.a., seamless client journeys. Onboarding is a breeze. Day-to-day interactions are smooth as butter. They make sure clients feel welcome and supported, blending fintech speed with accounting wisdom. A digital concierge ties it all together.
A knowledge sponge. Cross-training is their superpower. They soak up mom's deep industry expertise and dad's tech smarts. By sharing knowledge, this baby bridges gaps and builds solutions that actually work. They're always learning, always growing.
A feedback fanatic. This kid thrives on feedback. They listen to clients, learn what works and tweak what doesn't. Regular check-ins with the parents (a.k.a., their accounting and fintech teams) keep them ahead of the curve. Iteration is their middle name.
A financial matchmaker. Bundles are their jam. They know clients want it all — fintech tools and accounting services — so they package them together. Affordable, accessible and oh-so-attractive. Subscription models? They've got those too.
A teacher at heart. Empowerment is in their DNA. They're always hosting webinars, sharing how-to guides and teaching clients to make the most of their hybrid solutions. Knowledge is power, and they're all about spreading it.
This accounting-fintech baby is the total package: smart, efficient and built for the modern world. They streamline operations, simplify lives and make clients happier than ever. With advisory services that go beyond the basics, they don't just crunch numbers, they deliver insights that drive success.

The future isn't just bright — it's here, and it's adorable!

So, what's next for this financial wunderkind? The sky's the limit. Let's nurture this baby and watch it grow into something extraordinary.
Collaborative software is growing in popularity for both accountants and clients. Groupware, as it's also known, helps people work together on a common task to achieve their goals regardless of their physical location. It's improving teamwork and productivity in an interconnected world when we now have so many ways to communicate. 

A poll I conducted on LinkedIn showed that 44% of people prefer using a collaborative portal within their cloud accounting and finance software to communicate with clients. I also asked how they prefer to communicate with clients and only 33% want in-person meetings. That means accountants are more open than ever before to different communication channels. Couple this with clients who want their accountants to be more technologically savvy, and you can see the tides are changing. 

At its core, collaborative software integrates various communication and organizational functions — such as messaging, file sharing and task management — into a single platform. This unification of tools helps streamline workflows and fosters more effective collaboration between employees, partners and clients. Some of the collaborative tools we're seeing in software today include:

Communication tools. These include messaging platforms and email systems that facilitate communication among team members.
Coordination tools. These help with scheduling, task management and project management, ensuring the team is aligned and working toward the same goal.
Collaboration tools. These include document sharing and editing platforms, whiteboards and other tools that enable a team to work together on a shared task. 
Real-time communications like chat and discussion boards make it easy for teams to stay connected.

"When your financial software connects to your customers, they can use it to ask questions, send documents and provide feedback in real-time, greatly reducing the time required to address issues," said George Mahowald, CAS accounting practice leader at Bill360. "This helps you build lasting trust and improve the customer experience."

Bill360 is an AR automation platform with collaboration at its core. They are just one sample of the growing collaboration tools firms are using. Others include:

Google Sheets can be used for real-time editing, comments, version history and more.
Slack is a work management and productivity tool that aims to be the central platform through which teams communicate. It also helps bring every piece of a project together from start to finish. 
Client portals like ShareFile bring automation, e-signing and document sharing together with dedicated spaces for collaboration.
Many accounting software solutions like QuickBooks Online, Xero and Zoho Books, to name a few, contain collaboration features. It's so integral to FreshBooks that they trademarked the phrase "collaborative accounting."
Practice management tools like Keeper bring communications, file reviews, tasks and reporting all in one place.
With collaboration software, clients become active participants in the workflow. Truly, accountants and their clients can work as a team, enhancing productivity for everyone.

Why you want to use collaborative software
Accountants are relying more on collaborative software so teams work together efficiently and effectively. When everyone has 24/7 access to the same data, team performance and business success will be improved. Here are some key benefits firms see when using collaborative software:

Enhanced communication. Real-time communication makes it easier for team members to exchange ideas, ask questions and provide updates. It eliminates long email chains and is a central hub for conversation both internally and externally. "It's what really lets you meet your customers right where and when they need you most," said Mahowald.
Improved efficiency. Teams can save time by having all the necessary tools and information in one place. By allowing multiple team members to access and edit the same document simultaneously, collaborative software eliminates the need for back-and-forth email exchanges. This increases efficiency and improves version control, ensuring everyone has access to the most up-to-date information.
Remote work capabilities. Collaborative software is critical to maintaining team cohesion and productivity. Employees can work from any location, with access to the same files and resources, ensuring seamless collaboration across different time zones or regions. It allows remote teams to collaborate as if they were in the same room.
Streamlined project management. Collaborative software often includes project management capabilities, allowing team leaders to assign tasks, set deadlines and track progress. This helps ensure that everyone is on the same page, reducing the risk of miscommunication and missed deadlines.
Stronger team relationships. Collaboration helps build relationships and trust among team members, contributing to a supportive work atmosphere where everyone feels valued and motivated to contribute their best.
Knowledge sharing and innovation. Collaborative software provides a centralized space for team members to exchange ideas, offer feedback and collaborate on solutions. This enhances knowledge sharing within the organization, encourages innovation and ensures that the best ideas rise to the top.
Collaborative teams can make more informed decisions by pooling their collective knowledge and focusing on customer needs. 

Collaborative software leads to a better CX
Collaborative software significantly enhances the client experience by improving communication, increasing transparency and fostering a more streamlined working relationship between clients and businesses. 

Improved communication is something clients will experience right away. Clients can interact with your firm quickly and efficiently. But they will also get visibility into ongoing projects. They can track their work's progress, see updates in real-time and provide feedback directly through the platform. This transparency builds trust and strengthens client relationships.

"When you can actively respond and act on customer feedback, you are building trust and improving the customer experience," Mahowald said.

In addition, clients appreciate: 
1. Faster delivery times. Decision-making is sped up and bottlenecks are reduced. Clients can approve work, provide feedback or request changes instantly. Miscommunication can be quickly cleared up and multiple team members can work on the same project at the same time. 
2. Tailored advisory solutions. By allowing clients to be part of the collaboration process, you can better understand their needs and deliver solutions tailored to their preferences. You know you need to provide more advisory services and this collaboration makes it easier to identify them. Whether it's adjusting a project in real-time or gathering feedback during different stages, clients have more control over the outcome.
3. Enhanced problem solving. When issues arise, both teams and clients can address them quickly by working together on the same platform. Immediate access to all relevant project data allows for swift resolution of concerns and improved service delivery. "With an audit trail, you can remember and prove what was agreed on," Mahowald said, "In the rare case it's needed, you can use it for dispute resolution, too."

Collaborative software aims to simplify
As with all software, anything with a collaborative component must align with the specific needs of your firm and your team dynamics. It should enhance productivity without adding complexity.

Collaborative software is essential for new firms looking to boost productivity, streamline communication and enhance both internal operations and client relationships. Its versatility and adaptability make it a powerful tool for improving project outcomes, fostering innovation and driving long-term success for you and your clients alike.

Can you imagine stepping into a time machine while also peeking into the future? Seems weird, right? But that's exactly how it felt at the Accounting Today Private Equity Summit!

You see, there was an entire room full of traditional, boomer-aged white men in jackets and suits. It very much felt like an accounting conference from a decade ago. But there was a big forward-looking twist — discussion around PE investment in accounting firms. When money talks, out come the polished shoes and tailored blazers!

If you missed it, here's what made this event a mix of nostalgia and fresh ideas:

Attendees at the 2024 PE Summit

One room, one crowd, big conversations
The setup was perfect for this topic. There were 300 people in one room, with no breakout sessions to split focus. Everyone had access to the same panels and fireside chats, which meant no FOMO (fear of missing out). And the networking breaks? A dream. Long enough to chat, mingle and snack on donuts or sip some wine.

The discussions were real. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. The panels included firms that had taken PE money sharing their journeys. They talked about the wins, the hurdles and everything in between. And — surprise — not everyone thought PE was the "greatest thing ever." However, most agreed it brought more positives than negatives.

Fresh cash for fresh ideas
One big takeaway was the opportunity for younger talent. PE introduces a way for high-potential employees to get a piece of the pie early. Forget waiting 15 years to become a partner. With PE, star players can reap financial rewards sooner, boosting retention and motivation.

And PE isn't about partners cashing out. It's about reinvesting in technology, hiring top talent and upgrading firm operations. That means firms can compete better, evolve faster and establish sustainable business models.

Busting myths about PE
Some people who walked into that room (and a number of you who are reading this) may think PE is all about greed. But is it really? Think about the partnership model in traditional firms — partners often pull profits without reinvesting in the business. PE firms, on the other hand, might tighten the ship financially, but they also bring in accountability and growth strategies.

And here's a fun fact: Many PE investors represent pension funds and other institutions. So, in a way, your grandma's retirement fund might be backing your firm's transformation. How's that for perspective?

The big industry shift
PE isn't for every firm. Private equity investors are picky. They are looking for well-run businesses with solid growth potential. This raises the bar for everyone. If you're competing with PE-backed firms, you'll need to up your game. That means better metrics, stronger management and a more accountable culture.

It's not just PE making waves. Venture capitalists, fintech and tech companies are entering the accounting space, too. They're pushing innovation, automating processes and even taking on clients that CPAs traditionally served. The disruption is real!

The innovation dilemma
But where's the innovation? Sure, PE brings money and management expertise, but that doesn't necessarily translate into innovation. Technology is often mistaken for innovation, but they're not the same. Adding automation to a broken business model doesn't solve fundamental problems.

Firms need to rethink their DNA. Innovation should be baked into their operations, not treated as an afterthought. If PE firms don't prioritize this, their investments could stall in the long term.

A vision for the future
The future of accounting isn't just about taking PE money or implementing technology. It's about reimagining how firms operate at scale. Add to that the opportunity for new players to build firms that embody cutting-edge business models, seamless tech integration and a culture of accountability and growth. Things are looking different! 

Now, imagine stepping back into that time machine, but this time you leap ahead to a vibrant, dynamic profession where firms are powered by innovation, fueled by talent and focused on client value, all while balancing profitability. That's where the real transformation lies.

Private equity might be the spark, but the transformation ahead depends on how we as a profession embrace the challenge. Are we content to tweak the old model, or are we ready to design the future? With radical change, we could create a profession that's not just profitable but also sustainable, innovative and, dare I say, enjoyable to work in.

Change is here, and it's exciting. Let's make it meaningful!

The accounting profession may have been built on numbers and spreadsheets, but today it's also a people business. Client relationships, employee morale and firm culture are as important to your success as the software that runs your programs. 

Think about it: There is a stark contrast between the people side of the business and the way most firms charge for their services. Nobody became an accountant to track their time in 10-minute increments or spend time filling out timesheets. Yet, at a time when employee motivation and client retention are of the upmost importance, firms employ an outdated pricing model almost designed to frustrate employees and clients alike. It makes no sense at all!

Here are six ways you can build a better firm culture while attracting and retaining top-level employees. It comes down to changing a single fundamental of your business — your pricing model.

1. Free employees from the tyranny of the clock. Your staff aren't factory workers, so why treat them as if they were? These highly trained, smart professional people are tasked with solving complex client problems and providing expert guidance, not obsessing over timesheets while fighting to meet arbitrary billing goals. If you switch their focus from the number of hours they bill per week to the knowledge and expertise they bring to the game, their work will become more meaningful to them. Clients will feel the change. 

Imagine how much more satisfying it is to know you're making a difference in a client's business instead of racing against a clock that never stops.

2. Empower employees to focus on results. No one outside of your office really cares how long it took to finish a project. They care about the quality of the work and how it benefits them. Your employees should have the same mindset. They should understand the scope of a project and what the client really needs. They should know how the project they are working on fits into the grand scheme of a client's financial puzzle. Then they should apply everything they've learned to arrive at a suitable solution that will make clients happy.

You can add up time all you want, but the final score is what really counts. Value pricing understands this and shifts employee incentives from the amount of time they work to the quality and value of the work they do. In so doing, it aligns employee incentives with what's good for the client.

3. Improve work-life balance. Burnout is a real problem and the billable hour is one of its biggest drivers. Most accountants have sat down at some point in their professional lives and wondered how to balance their family life with a profession that measures success by the amount of time they spend in their office. The pressure to constantly log more hours can lead to long days, late nights, and a lot of unnecessary stress. 

Value pricing is one of the keys to creating a healthier, more balanced work environment — one where employees feel more fulfilled while still generating profits for the company. An odd thing happens when results become the focus: Employees can manage their time more effectively and find ways to work more efficiently. There's less overtime, fewer late nights, more family time and a far healthier balance between work and personal life.

Happy employees are productive employees. The benefits of switching to a value pricing model will ripple through the firm, improving retention rates while encouraging higher-quality work.

4. Create a more positive office culture. Slaves to the billable hour spend a lot of time watching the clock and worrying about wasting time on anything beyond the spread sheet in front of them. It's a recipe for drudgery. An office culture where collaboration, innovation and engagement fade. 

Think about what happens when the focus shifts to client results. Focusing on results encourages everything the billable hour discourages: Collaboration. Innovation. Attention to detail. Predictably, employees will work together to deliver better outcomes for clients, knowing their contributions are valued.

Value pricing also makes it easier to recognize and reward employees for things that really matter — problem-solving, client satisfaction and innovation. This creates a culture where quality is prioritized over quantity. And that's the kind of culture where people want to stick around. 

5. Attract and retain top talent. Every generation has its unique perspectives, and you can't expect millennial employees to respond to the same incentives as Gen Zers. However, there are some commonalities between all generations. No matter their age, most people want to be recognized for their accomplishments and their unique capabilities, rather than their sameness. A strong firm culture acknowledges these facts and looks for ways to uniquely help employees build more fulfilling careers while improving the overall quality of service your firm provides. 

A firm that values unique employee expertise and provides better growth opportunities is bound to both attract and retain top talent. Better talent leads to better quality service which, in turn, leads to greater client satisfaction. It's a positive circle that starts with value pricing and ends up helping you build a culture of continuous improvement. A win-win situation for employees looking for more professional fulfillment and clients looking for increasingly better results.

6. Encourage professional growth. It stands to reason that if the incentive is to deliver expert services and solve client problems, employees will spend more time on professional development because it holds the keys to their success. Again, value pricing aligns employee performance with client needs.

Beyond sharpening their expertise, this results-based focus will also encourage employees to think about their day-to-day activities in a different way. The focus will shift from grinding out hours to delivering superior results. Stronger client relationships will follow.

A happier, healthier workplace starts with pricing

Value pricing is not a cure-all for every problem facing today's accounting firms. The work will still be challenging, even more so in many instances. There will still be some long hours required to deliver timely. And there will still be those overly demanding clients who try to get more than the agreed-up scope. But there is probably no bigger step a firm can take toward meeting the challenges facing modern accounting firms than implementing a value pricing model.

At the end of the day, pricing is about people as much as it's about profits. Moving away from the billable hour and embracing value pricing aligns firm success with client success. In so doing, it creates a more positive, fulfilling work environment. A culture of collaboration and growth will flourish while employees will enjoy improved work/life balance.

In the end, value pricing isn't just a better way to do business. It's a better way to work.
It is an exciting time to be an accountant! There are ample opportunities for growth and positive changes driven by automation and new technologies. However, that doesn't mean the industry isn't facing its share of challenges. 

In "Automation: Putting accounting on the right path," ShareFile found that 93% of accountants expressed satisfaction with the current state of the profession. At times accountants may feel overworked and they don't feel like they can work at top efficiency, but at the same time, they realize that technology could help solve those issues. 

Firms have more work than staff to do it. That's both an opportunity and a problem, right? We aren't hurting for clients, but we have to figure out how to get the work done. That's why automation is coming into play; it's being fueled by the influx of private equity and venture capital dollars in the profession. And after years of being heads down focused on COVID-related issues, the Paycheck Protection Program and the Employee Retention Credit, accountants are once again focusing on their firms, and we are ready for the tools to help. 

In a recent conversation with Geni Whitehouse of the Impactful Advisor on this topic, she pointed out that accountants can provide a level of service that wasn't possible before thanks to new tools and a new perspective on client expectations.  

"We have come into this profession to serve," she said, "and that keeps us motivated regardless of the challenges we face on a day-to-day basis. So, the more automation we can apply to relieve the burden, the better the service."

It's hard to separate automation from the work that accountants do. Think about it: We've embraced mainframes, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, etc., so automation has always been instrumental to what we do. What is new is the influx of data coming our way and the weak process in place to drive the effectiveness of new technologies. 

Accountants are frustrated that technology can't solve their problems, the ShareFile study found. They want to make a greater impact, but that will require firms to first update their outdated technology. Almost 80% of respondents believe they are doing their jobs effectively, but not efficiently. 

COVID taught us — forced us — to become advisors, and there is no turning back. Our value is based on the impact we provide to the entire organization. As more automation, more AI and more everything comes into our space, technology is impacting what we're delivering to the business as a whole. We need to figure out how to utilize the tools to do our jobs as impactful advisors. We can't just operate in the what and forget about the why. 

An increased client experience

You can't just add technology without being more human. It doesn't let you off the hook for picking up the phone and talking to a client — clients still want to talk to their accountants. The more you automate, the more human you have to be. 

Most accountants agree. The study found that 97% of respondents agree that technology will support and improve client experience. The time savings that come from automation will give accountants time to do what they love most: serve their clients. 

artificial-intelligence-two.jpg

"Much of the historical focus for automation has been how can I make it easy for me to do stuff inside the firm and not what's the impact on that client experience," said Whitehouse. 

The focus should be on communicating with clients proactively, not once a year, she explained. We want to exchange information in a way that serves both the client and the firm. But that requires that we free ourselves from those things that keep us from doing so. 

Automation is fueling many tools to help accountants be more advisory. It's that newfound time that lets you use these tools and have more meaningful conversations with clients about what matters most to them. 

Always be learning

Accountants need to be aware of what's going on around us, both in the market and in the technology itself. We're innovative by nature, so tap into it and lead the charge to understand what clients need to do better. Then educate the clients on how we can provide even greater value.

"We've got to continue to seek solutions that better serve our clients. That helps us provide more timely, relevant service to the client, not just a balanced financial statement or GAAP-compliant financial statement," said Whitehouse. 

But as technology becomes more pervasive, the focus has to be on choosing the right technology. Throughout the study, respondents were clear they wanted new technology solutions that would help them be more efficient and provide a better client experience. Not having the right resources is a problem for 69% of accountants. You need to learn about the options and how they solve your unique problems. 

"Knowing the language of numbers is the base level of understanding for anything that you do in the business world," said Whitehouse. 

When you understand the data and the tools that will automate much of what you do, you will be on fire. That's where we need to go as a profession.


Hey ChatGPT, is the IRS ready to modernize?" 

When asking that question, ChatGPT said: "Modernizing the IRS has been a topic of discussion for several years, and various initiatives were underway to improve technology infrastructure, enhance taxpayer services and increase efficiency." 

That's true. In 2019, the IRS published its modernization plan that focused on four main pillars — the taxpayer experience, core taxpayer services and enforcement, modernized IRS operations, and cybersecurity and data protection. While about a quarter of the initially proposed budget was rescinded, the IRS still has tens of billions of dollars to put these modernization plans into practice. The service has stated it plans to use "innovative technologies and processes" in the coming years to further modernize operations. 

The ChatGPT response wrapped up with a shoutout "to consult with tax professionals or government sources for the most current information." Well, that's what I did during a recent conversation with Chuck Rettig, former IRS commissioner and board member for K1x. And it seems as if the IRS is attuned to the problems and is searching for solutions. 

"You have technology that can streamline a process," Rettig said, "which, when you have a shortage of accountants, is huge."

What it will take to modernize

Partner Insights from Intuit Quickbooks
For the IRS to modernize and meet evolving taxpayer expectations, a few things need to happen. First, there needs to be skilled internal staff ready to advance the organization. Second, the budget needs to continue to support the proposed efforts. Third, the IRS needs to want to modernize and have the technology available to do so.

When there is limited staff available to process tax returns, anything that can streamline the process will help considerably. There is modernized e-filing available for organizations with smaller partnerships, but what if we took this a step further and fully automated the filing process?

"The IRS had the same issues with respect to processing information [stuck in forms]. When you streamline that and digitize it, you significantly reduce the error rate. That allows electronically filed documents to process through the system at lightspeed." Rettig said. "That helps the resources in the tax community and it helps the resources in the IRS. It reduces errors and people get their refunds faster." 

That's an all-win situation! Getting there will take serious effort, though. 

Preparing for new tech

If old and new technology come together, it can make a difference for the tax professional and the IRS. Retting believes it will happen. The IRS created a digitization office in 2021 loosely referred to as Team DG. This requires a tremendous amount of contractor effort outside of the IRS. During his tenure at the IRS, Retting reached out to fintech for help in modernization, and he uses e-file as an example of change that would not have happened without private sector help.

"Technology people like a challenge and the IRS provides that challenge," Rettig said. 

IRS Commissioner Charles "Chuck" Rettig
Former IRS Commissioner Charles RettigAndrew Harrer/Bloomberg
As for the timeline for any change, "We have to watch the way the wind blows," he explained, but he estimates it won't happen before fiscal year 2024 or 2025. When it does, Rettig believes it's going to make a difference for real people. He's confident the IRS is headed in the right direction.  

There are over 1.2 septillion possible ways to file a 1040 alone. Full digitization to speed up the filing and return process would have a huge impact on the industry! Just imagine all the things you could do when you are not buried in the details.

Having the right people and resources

It's hard for you to do what you need to be doing when you are so focused on the details. Luckily, there are a large number of cool new tech solutions that can help with the grunt work, freeing up time for you to do higher-level work. Because of that, tax professionals realize they are now at the bridge of technology and want the IRS to change with the profession — to make their lives so much easier. Retting believes this is coming. 

"I think the acceleration over the next 10 years is going to far exceed us going from no computers, almost no internet access, etc.," he said. "I think that we're about ready for an explosion in the tax world. An explosion that will help people and get more people into the field."

But what about the concerns with technology, especially AI, replacing skilled workers? The good news is that, according to Rettig, the plan is not to replace workers with automated solutions. He shared a story about when Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin talked to IRS employees about modernization and how an employee said he took modernization to mean replacing them. 

"Mnuchin looks up and says, 'Do you think in your lifetime or mine, we're ever going to have too many employees at the IRS? It's not going to happen,'" Rettig said. Mnuchin then transitioned into talking about there being a focus on upskilling and career advancement for current employees in the coming years.

"I think that both public and private should look at technology like that," he said. 

While the IRS may not be the most glamorous place to work, it could be the perfect fit for tax professionals looking to grow their careers. Rettig emphasizes that technology is ultimately driven by people. Even with technology powering your work, you still need human oversight to ensure accuracy and relevance. And you need humans to continue advancing your work. By leveraging AI to its fullest potential, you can even use technology to improve human experiences.

Of course, no one can see the future, so you'll have to stay tuned to see what happens at the IRS in the coming years. But for now, focus on the positive potential of technology in tax and the important role of human expertise in driving it forward!
Let's be honest: Clients don't care about tax prep. Sure, they care about it getting done. They want to be able to sleep at night, knowing that it's off their plate, but beyond that, the prep itself isn't valuable to them. 

What clients do care about is reducing their taxes. That's where advisory services come in. To do tax advisory right, CPAs need to have a holistic view of their clients. This involves understanding their business, the relationships with their family and what their goals are when it comes to leaving a legacy. 

"Tax advisory is a very comprehensive service that helps clients build wealth by having more money to build wealth with because they're reducing tax," said Tom Wheelwright, founder of the WealthAbility Network, who has more than 40 years of tax advisory experience.

Making tax advisory services the focus of your firm can build a lot of value for your clients. However, too many CPAs think about how to charge for advisory services after they've already given them, instead of creating a model based on advisory from the beginning. Breaking that habit can be hard, especially if you view the work you do for clients as a commodity. 

"We have decided that tax returns are a commodity," said Wheelwright. Rather than race to the bottom on price, he chooses to compete with other firms on value instead. This requires a focus on what you uniquely provide that isn't offered by anyone else. That's where you go the extra mile to offer true advisory services.

When transforming the relationship with your client into an advisory one, you need to start by understanding what the client is trying to accomplish in the first place. Don't wait for the client to start asking questions. Instead, diagnose, ask questions and focus your energy on them, instead of the transactional work. 

You're going to want to ask about long-term goals that address the life of their business and the legacy they want to leave. For some clients, this may look like breaking even, where they don't want to leave any money or debt behind. Others might want to leave a successful business to their children and grandchildren. 

The planning and work that go into these two scenarios look very different. The answers and guidance CPAs provide these people will also look different. But you won't know what your client wants to do until you ask probing questions that help you find out "what's the why behind the why" of their business, as Wheelwright puts it. 

Once you start asking these probing questions, you'll find that the answers start becoming distinct quickly. If you ask two different clients what they want and why they want it, both might say they want to reduce their taxes, but their "why" for this could be significantly different. For example, one might not want to pay taxes because they're just against them. Another might be looking to grow. Or, one may want to give money to charitable foundations, while another may want to leave money for their children. Knowing their desires is imperative to providing the advice that brings their wishes into reach. 

Tax advisory is a lifetime service 

Doing this kind of work requires a multiyear plan, which moves your relationship from a transaction to something that is much more meaningful. Tax planning is not tax advisory, nor should it be. "If you want lifetime clients, focus on their lifetime," said Wheelwright. "If you want a client for three months, focus on three months." 

Planning for the long term is more beneficial for your clients and your relationship with them. Projecting out a tax strategy that takes into account the shifts in incentives and changes in tax law will be more advantageous for your clients and reflect well on you as a result. 

If you're telling yourself that you're already doing this and your clients are happy because they come back every year, know that clients can be slow to move away even if they aren't raving fans of what you do. 

"Just because a client comes back every year, that doesn't mean that you've been really a strong advisor for them every year," said Wheelwright. 

Being so entrenched in your client's business can feel like a strength, but Wheelwright says it's a weakness because it makes CPAs complacent. Even though they aren't leaving right now, you need to ask yourself what you're doing for your clients. It can be hard to shift into this kind of work, but you'll find that once you start focusing on your clients, your work will become more interesting and your clients will be happier. 

Deepen your knowledge

Should tax advisors have a specialty or should they take a generalist approach? That might depend on who's on your team. If you have people on your team who are specialists in particular areas — say, real estate — it makes it easier to build a specialty practice. Your specialties also need to extend to the team outside your office. Financial planners, life insurance experts and bankers all play a role in establishing your expertise and specialty to attract and retain clients. 

It boils down to this: "Do what you're really good at and let other people do what they're really good at," said Wheelwright. You do need to be a generalist when it comes to knowing a little of everything. But to be a strong advisor, you need to know a lot about a few things. 

How you choose whom to work with is also heavily relationship-focused, making the criteria look different from what you might be used to. For example, Wheelwright likes working with mission-driven entrepreneurs, but he has one other important qualification: "I have to like hanging out with them." Why spend your time with clients you don't enjoy? Identify your target buyer and focus on them. 

Quantify your tax advisory 

Once you've worked on shifting your mindset, changing what's valued in your firm, and getting clear on your ideal client, you need to work on quantifying your advisory services. This comes down to deciding what deliverables go with each step and how they can be valued. 

"We need to remember that every minute we spend with them is a minute of their time that they're giving to us," said Wheelwright. "We need to value their time." 

From that perspective, you have to consider what your plan looks like to ensure you can work on it every time you meet with them while adding value. 

Creating a tax advisory-based firm is a plus for you and your clients. You get to focus on client relationships instead of pure transactions, and your client feels more valued in return. While it can feel like a large ship to turn around to change the course of your business, don't forget that you can make the shift in stages. Find what works for you, and add value to what your clients really care about over time and every time you meet. This is how you become the trusted advisor you aim to be.

The market has finally shifted. What does that mean exactly? Most of the old-school accounting firms are now moving to new, advanced practices. They have started to look at different pricing models, automation, and a different approach to firm culture. They are looking at alternative business models besides a partnership and putting customers first. They are now what would have been considered radical years ago.

Back in 2010 when the Radical CPA movement started, many peers and thought leaders told us it takes 12 years to shift a market. We've now had about 12 years to actually move the market, with a lot of that advancement likely happening since COVID. 

Here are a few notable changes that show that the market has shifted: 

The people attending events are different compared to those who attended several years ago. There were quite a few larger firms, bookkeepers and accounting professionals who aren't CPAs at the most recent QBConnect. Some people dabbled in tax but may not have been completely in tech. The market was younger and energized. The diversity of the crowd was noticeable; there was a whole different vibe. There was a similar scene at a recent state society tax conference.
Next-gen accountants are opening their own firms. They're building them around communities using digital marketing. The shift is actually happening with leadership, which is huge and makes a big impact. 
There are pockets of innovation in larger firms. They're changing from within, and the managing partners are on board. That was never the case until 2020. It's everywhere now. 
Outside investors in private equity are looking at our industry. There are alternatives to a traditional CPA or accounting firm now that funding is coming in. Firms are getting split up and restructured.
All this outside money creates leverage for new technology. There are at least seven or eight new technologies coming into the space that focus just on the accounting industry. When has that happened? In the past, tech disruptions have occurred maybe once every few years or so.
And what's even more important is that there are multiple communities pushing for innovation at the same time — helping those who want to move their firms forward!
These are all signs of a market shift that didn't exist before. 

The pandemic's role 

During COVID, people gravitated toward online communities by default. When they did that, they found different communities than maybe what they were used to circulating in. And these online communities have evolved. It's been the spark that's needed to actually make a movement happen; to just move faster.

Partner Insights from Canopy
COVID pushed this evolution because people had to adapt and change, and quickly. But what's happened is that people are starting to look at how their firms used to change in the past, what they want to evolve to, and how they want their culture to be. 

A lot of old-school firms just went away over these last three tax seasons. And that's OK. Some firms have said "These changes are too much," and they're going backward. But those firms are few and far between. There are more firms that are asking instead: "How can I keep going and build this momentum? How do I make my own firm? How do I optimize my firm?" And that's great to hear.

Keep pushing forward

Twelve years is a long time to wait for a shift. And if you think about AI and what's coming up next, we just need to keep pushing and moving forward. The good thing is that the majority of the accounting profession has caught up a little so we're not so far behind as we were.

It's really exciting and amazing to see and it's going to get even better as we're on the verge of accomplishing even more.

On this episode, I chatted with the Radical CPA, Jody Padar, about her journey building a career and firm. Throughout the interview, she details how she embraced every change along the way to make the radical shifts she needed to thrive, providing useful advice to others on how to do the same throughout. 

The world is constantly changing, as is business and accounting. Jody talks us through the important questions about changing technologies in the workplace; answering questions as she speaks: Should we feel threatened by AI and technology transformation? Can technology and bots be our ally and help us achieve more? How do we adapt and thrive?

KEY TAKEAWAYS:


1.   TECHNOLOGY CAN BE OUR FRIEND AND ALLY, SHAPING ACCOUNTING ROLES TOWARDS CONSULTING AND ANALYTICS


Rather than fear the growing use of AI in the accounting industry, Jodi advocates for a welcoming of advanced technologies; using technology better allows accountants to maximize their time focusing on the human relations and critical thinking aspects of effective accounting that can’t be automated. The technology will strongly connect the accounting and data analytics fields, and help accountants get home on time. 


2.   LIFELONG LEARNING IS A KEY TO EMBRACING CHANGE


As technologies change, the learning curve may seem steep. Jody discusses the benefits of adopting the mindset of a lifelong learner; a constant student of technology and the world. Earnestly learning about changing technologies through interest and wonder can be much more effective than consistently asking for assistance with running a program. Learning to adapt and grow with technology through a positive mindset can be extremely effective. 


3.   MANAGEMENT MUST CHANGE ALONG WITH TECHNOLOGY


Engaging and effective leadership and management can build teams of dedicated accountants regardless of surrounding technology. Management focus should be on leading, not micromanaging or ordering. Working with colleagues and supervisors on defining roles and taking leadership opportunities can boost morale throughout the team. Jody advises professionals to be clear with what’s important to them, and not to be afraid to ask for what they want in these circumstances.

💬 About our guest, Jody Padar: Jody Padar, known as the radical CPA, began her “radical journey” 13 years ago. Jody was at an old-school firm with seven partners. As a young staff member, Jody was working an insane number of hours. When she became a mother, Jody knew the culture of the firm was just not right for her.  That’s when she decided to join her dad’s firm. One of the first things he said to her was, “this is my practice, and you’ll need to go find your own customers.” And that was the best advice he ever gave Jody.  Today, Jody Padar is vice president of strategy at Botkeeper, Inc., an accounting software firm based in the Chicago area. As one of the profession’s visionary thought leaders, Jody has redefined the business model of an accounting practice.

Jody Padar, author of “The Radical CPA” publications and founder of New Visions CPA Group, was our guest for this episode of Life In Accounting, a podcast production of Where Accountants Go!

Ice Cream and Taxes
Jody was influenced to pursue accounting in the same manner as many accountants – she had family in the industry.  Her father had a tax practice, and she helped him out from a very early age.  He knew how to motivate as well… every trip to get the returns processed at Computax meant a trip for ice cream as well!  The reward at the end of the work was a strong influencer early in life, and so accounting was a career interest for Jody from early on.

Unfortunate Circumstances Lead to Joy
As her career progressed in public accounting during her first few years, she found that she enjoyed and was talented in the tech side of accounting.  She was doing well pursuing a career with CPA firms, when she unfortunately got laid off from a firm due to needing to be out during busy season for the birth of her child.  Obviously this didn’t sit well with Jody, so she became determined to start her own practice and run it in a decidedly different manner.  It’s interesting how life turns out… it was exactly that difficult situation that helped propel her to the success she enjoys today.

Life for The Radical CPA
Currently Jody spends her time in many endeavors.  She still owns the New Vision CPA Group, but due to having a solid team she has been able to pursue other ventures as well.  She is the author of “The Radical CPA” books, hosts a podcast, and has just joined Botkeeper as an outsourced executive focused on helping them continuing to grow.  She’s definitely busy, but you can tell she thoroughly enjoys the mix and variety.  Her happiness and excitement about her career comes through clearly in this podcast interview.  We had a great time recording it.
