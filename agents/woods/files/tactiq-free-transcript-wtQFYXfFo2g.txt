00:00:07.440 where in your life right now are you
00:00:08.800 being really purposeful are you focused

00:01:05.519 are you today david i am doing lovely
00:01:08.000 today how was your day so glad to hear
00:01:10.560 that i'm dealing with some legal issues
00:01:12.880 that we talked about a little bit but
00:01:14.240 other than that my day's doing pretty
00:01:17.200 good all around we had an amazing
00:01:19.360 conversation today
00:01:20.960 with jeff woods the host of the one
00:01:23.600 thing podcast and goal setting
00:01:25.759 extraordinaire so on today's show we're
00:01:28.159 actually bringing in two bigger pockets
00:01:30.720 members who attended the one thing goal
00:01:33.040 setting retreat and they're going to
00:01:34.560 share what they learned how they form
00:01:36.400 their partnership what they've been up
00:01:38.479 to since then and then jeff sort of
00:01:40.320 dives deep and helps us figure out
00:01:42.560 really where their business could be
00:01:44.240 headed and how to get in alignment with
00:01:46.640 their goals would you like to share what
00:01:48.560 your favorite parts of today's show were
00:01:50.799 oh
00:01:52.079 i
00:01:52.960 like the way that he looks at goal
00:01:55.360 setting a little bit differently i have
00:01:57.200 always thought of goal setting and i
00:01:59.200 think a lot of people are like me
00:02:01.439 you what is the goal what do i want to
00:02:02.960 accomplish
00:02:04.000 and that's not really where he's looking
00:02:06.399 at this he is looking at
00:02:09.038 what does this goal do for you not what
00:02:11.920 do you want to accomplish but what can
00:02:13.840 you
00:02:14.560 get out of this goal and
00:02:17.440 one of the things he says is the purpose
00:02:19.120 of the goal is not the result
00:02:21.599 that was really
00:02:23.520 eye-opening i think that he has
00:02:26.239 a very interesting way of looking at
00:02:29.040 the way that you set goals and clearly
00:02:31.120 he is succeeding on all levels and he is
00:02:33.200 definitely somebody who is an absolute
00:02:36.239 thought leader in the space of setting
00:02:38.480 goals which can be really really
00:02:40.000 important in your whole
00:02:42.879 life i mean we talk about
00:02:45.040 how life can just drag you along
00:02:48.080 and setting goals and being intentional
00:02:50.560 is the way that you take control of your
00:02:52.319 life yeah and that's going to lead us to
00:02:54.239 today's quick tip for everyone listening
00:02:56.640 here it's very simple
00:02:58.319 ask yourself what are your values and
00:03:01.680 how have you strayed away from them so
00:03:03.680 we know that we're operating by the
00:03:05.360 values that are important to us in my
00:03:07.599 opinion when we feel alive when you're
00:03:09.680 full of that fire
00:03:11.360 and you are full of sort of this
00:03:13.280 optimistic energy that wants to charge
00:03:15.280 forward and make things happen life
00:03:17.200 feels light when you're living by your
00:03:18.800 values when you're living by somebody
00:03:20.640 else's values it often feels heavy and
00:03:22.879 you feel sluggish and there's a
00:03:24.159 resistance to what you're doing so
00:03:26.080 brandon turner often has that phrase
00:03:27.920 follow the fire mini i believe you've
00:03:29.360 sent me a couple of those t-shirts i
00:03:30.799 should put one of those on on the next
00:03:32.319 show i love those shirts the follow your
00:03:34.640 fire t-shirt the best way to find your
00:03:37.440 fire is to find your goals now
00:03:40.480 as far as the word fire this will end
00:03:42.560 the quick tip here but mindy can you
00:03:44.400 tell us a little about what fire means
00:03:45.920 in your community in my community fire
00:03:48.720 means financial independence retire
00:03:50.720 early or retire uh
00:03:54.640 retire early is what
00:03:56.640 fire means but there's been a lot of
00:03:58.480 talk about how you don't retire to do
00:04:00.239 nothing you retire to your best life
00:04:02.959 when you get money out of the way you
00:04:05.439 can concentrate on
00:04:07.200 your goals and you you're not trading
00:04:09.760 your time for money anymore you now can
00:04:12.000 go out and live your best life which
00:04:13.840 means you can live by your value so this
00:04:16.000 is very very important and you will see
00:04:17.519 if you listen to today's show
00:04:19.358 just how finding direction is usually
00:04:21.680 the result of getting clear on what you
00:04:24.080 value and what you want and then
00:04:25.600 everything else kind of falls into place
00:04:27.120 after that a lot of people make that
00:04:28.400 mistake and i think when you don't know
00:04:30.400 what your value is you tend to follow
00:04:32.400 somebody else's path you say what's
00:04:34.240 mindy investing in okay i'm gonna go
00:04:35.840 invest in that what's brandon doing okay
00:04:37.919 i'm gonna go do mobile home parks
00:04:39.199 because that's what brandon does and you
00:04:40.960 follow somebody else's path
00:04:43.120 and you're not always going to be happy
00:04:44.560 you're definitely not going to feel fire
00:04:46.080 so ask yourself what are your values and
00:04:48.400 if you don't know today's episode is
00:04:50.240 just for you also i would highly
00:04:52.240 encourage you if you're the type of
00:04:53.440 person who likes attending events or
00:04:54.880 maybe even if you're not to consider
00:04:57.040 going to the one thing retreat that jeff
00:04:59.680 talks about on today's show so
00:05:01.919 i'm gonna go ahead and let us get into
00:05:03.600 that is there anything that you'd like
00:05:04.880 to add before we bring in jeff you know
00:05:07.120 i want to say that the one thing retreat

00:05:46.160 mr jeff woods welcome back to the bigger
00:05:49.039 pockets podcast how are you today
00:05:50.960 delightful david thank you for having me
00:05:54.000 yeah so in our first
00:05:56.240 conversation with you we had you dig
00:05:58.800 into speaking with some of our other
00:06:00.800 guests and sort of giving them some
00:06:02.639 clarity direction on how they could set
00:06:04.479 goals for themselves or how they could
00:06:05.840 be more efficient what's been going on
00:06:08.560 in your world since that initial
00:06:10.400 conversation you know when you and i
00:06:12.400 spoke last year it was
00:06:14.800 middle of the pandemic
00:06:16.639 wait it was pre-pandemic wasn't it
00:06:19.759 was it pre-pandemic or middle i think it
00:06:21.520 uh no i think it was before so i'm
00:06:23.600 remembering it you know
00:06:25.680 bottom line i think
00:06:27.120 every person who's listening to this is
00:06:29.520 in a very different place today than
00:06:31.280 they were a year ago or 18 months ago
00:06:34.560 and one of the things that i i heard
00:06:36.240 from a
00:06:37.360 friend of ours named keith cunningham
00:06:39.919 what stops us from reinventing ourself
00:06:42.080 is an attachment to the way things used
00:06:43.759 to be
00:06:45.600 i think a lot of us the the pandemic
00:06:47.360 taught us that we had beliefs that we
00:06:50.160 knew to be true we have to go to an
00:06:52.720 office we have to do things this way and
00:06:55.280 the pandemic forced people to
00:06:57.599 let go of the way things used to be to
00:07:00.319 imagine what could become and for us
00:07:02.560 it's been the same thing from
00:07:05.120 i moved to denver colorado because i
00:07:07.120 took our company virtual and i wanted to
00:07:08.800 be closer to the bigger pockets family
00:07:11.520 aka the mountains
00:07:13.360 and also
00:07:14.960 just what our business model is we got
00:07:16.720 so much more clear on
00:07:19.360 why we do what we do
00:07:21.440 and who we need to be serving and we've
00:07:23.360 just gone all in and narrowing our focus
00:07:24.960 and companies doubled in the last 12
00:07:26.639 months which is awesome mindy i'm going
00:07:28.560 to ask the same question to you
00:07:30.639 what's been going on in your world
00:07:34.000 it has been quite a last 18 months i
00:07:37.919 think it's lasted six years so far
00:07:41.039 there's just
00:07:43.440 right before the pandemic started we
00:07:45.039 bought our latest live-in flip and we
00:07:47.039 have been trying to juggle that with
00:07:49.520 uh becoming teachers we we homeschooled
00:07:52.479 our children not on purpose or
00:07:55.199 uh for
00:07:56.840 our um
00:07:59.919 not not on not by our choice and that
00:08:02.960 was that was a real treat uh but we are
00:08:05.680 coming out on the other side of it and
00:08:08.240 things are looking up actually when i
00:08:09.840 was listening re-listening to episode
00:08:12.000 411
00:08:13.520 like you know i really need to start
00:08:16.560 having goals and
00:08:19.120 being intentional with my living instead
00:08:21.680 of letting life kind of drag me by i
00:08:24.400 have not had any goals
00:08:27.039 i have had
00:08:28.400 tasks i have had a to-do list and
00:08:32.080 uh that was actually really really
00:08:33.760 really helpful that and
00:08:35.440 scott and i
00:08:36.559 interviewed ramit sethi on monday and
00:08:39.760 that episode comes out in a couple of
00:08:41.039 weeks and that also really helped me
00:08:43.440 start thinking you know what i've got to
00:08:44.880 make a big shift in my life so um it's
00:08:47.839 it's been a
00:08:49.200 an eye-opening last couple of 18 months
00:08:54.000 how about you david let's throw it back
00:08:55.440 to you what's been going on with you
00:08:57.200 well where do i start this has actually
00:08:59.040 been a very busy year so when i started
00:09:02.560 the year i thought that growing the
00:09:04.320 david green team was going to be the
00:09:05.600 main primary
00:09:07.760 goal
00:09:08.640 i've sort of shifted from there we're
00:09:10.399 still doing great but i don't put as
00:09:11.839 much energy into the hiring and training
00:09:13.920 of agents as i was before
00:09:16.160 i started the one brokerage which is
00:09:17.920 basically like a mortgage company that i
00:09:19.839 can also do insurance that we use to
00:09:21.680 help people with financing real estate
00:09:23.360 we really put a lot of effort into
00:09:25.519 solving the problem of people like me
00:09:26.880 that can't get more conventional loans
00:09:29.200 or that their debt to income doesn't
00:09:31.360 support buying additional property
00:09:33.040 because as we talk to people on bigger
00:09:34.480 pockets about making wise investments
00:09:36.720 you often sort of run yourself off the
00:09:38.800 track of i could just get a traditional
00:09:42.160 loan to buy houses i bought some
00:09:44.480 properties for myself i bought a couple
00:09:46.080 in hawaii i bought a triple net property
00:09:48.880 in minneapolis i'm looking to sell some
00:09:51.839 of my uh southern floridies and
00:09:55.040 my southern
00:09:56.640 properties and 1031 those into some
00:09:59.279 bigger properties i'm expecting a lot of
00:10:01.200 inflation to be coming our way with the
00:10:02.800 way that the fret the fed is just
00:10:04.800 printing money like crazy so i've
00:10:06.959 basically taken a more
00:10:09.360 um aggressive offensive stance towards
00:10:12.480 wealth building right now as opposed to
00:10:14.160 where i was before i was kind of sitting
00:10:15.680 back and waiting for opportunities to
00:10:17.120 cross my path and jumping on the right
00:10:18.720 ones i'm now being intentional about
00:10:20.880 looking to go higher loan officers for
00:10:23.040 our company get better loan products
00:10:25.760 buy more properties for myself do more
00:10:27.680 meetups where i can share this
00:10:28.720 information with other people so i think
00:10:30.160 that's been the biggest change for me
00:10:31.680 this year is that i've taken a more
00:10:33.360 aggressive approach
00:10:34.880 jeff i don't know if you heard the word
00:10:36.880 intentional from both david and i that
00:10:40.240 was not intentional we didn't plan this
00:10:42.000 in advance
00:10:43.120 uh we both said we want to be more
00:10:44.959 intentional with our
00:10:46.880 uh our
00:10:48.399 plans and our the way that we're living
00:10:50.320 our lives and i think that's i think
00:10:52.000 that's very interesting good job
00:10:54.160 if only that were the purpose of this
00:10:55.440 episode
00:10:57.600 yeah it's almost like it was meant to be
00:11:00.000 so jeff you're sort of the expert at
00:11:02.240 least in my world that i think of when i
00:11:03.920 think about goal setting you and jay
00:11:05.519 papasan i know you two have a
00:11:06.959 relationship so that's not
00:11:08.959 a surprise that that's the case
00:11:11.279 tell me what's on your heart when it
00:11:12.560 comes to advice you want to give people
00:11:14.480 about when they should be intentional
00:11:16.240 when they should let life come to them
00:11:18.480 and really how to maximize efficientness
00:11:20.480 when it comes to achieving what our
00:11:21.680 goals are
00:11:22.720 we come we have a very strong
00:11:25.600 opinion when it comes to this and it's
00:11:28.240 shared through the lens of
00:11:30.720 our guidance is for people who want to
00:11:32.880 achieve extraordinary results
00:11:36.240 we are not for people who want good
00:11:38.800 results average results great results we
00:11:41.360 we speak to people who want to actually
00:11:43.839 live an extraordinary life personally
00:11:47.440 and professionally
00:11:49.040 if that is you which i know it's a lot
00:11:50.880 of bp listeners just because you're
00:11:53.120 investing your time listening to the
00:11:55.200 show
00:11:57.440 now is the time
00:12:00.240 here's the reality though um and and
00:12:02.399 this had this applies to me too we have
00:12:04.079 times in our life where we are living by
00:12:05.920 default and we have times in our life
00:12:07.279 where we are living by design
00:12:09.519 there are times in our life where things
00:12:11.279 happen
00:12:12.240 happen in our lives and we have to react
00:12:15.040 whether they're happening to us or for
00:12:16.880 us and there are times in our life where
00:12:18.320 we say no i am not good with my current
00:12:20.560 circumstances here is where i want to be
00:12:22.959 i'm going to get clear on what matters
00:12:24.480 to me and i'm going to put a plan in
00:12:25.839 place and i'm going to start to take
00:12:27.279 focused action toward that
00:12:30.000 it's it you know it's kind of like a
00:12:31.600 roller coaster up and down we ebb and
00:12:33.279 flow between those two and
00:12:35.680 i think this is the purpose of this
00:12:37.120 episode is to challenge people to ask
00:12:39.839 the question
00:12:41.760 if i were to look at my life over the
00:12:44.399 last six months or the last year
00:12:46.800 where was i purposeful or intentional
00:12:50.240 where was i really getting clarity and
00:12:52.000 where i want to be putting that plan
00:12:53.600 into place taking focused action
00:12:56.079 purposeful action to get where i want to
00:12:57.920 go and where was i kind of just going
00:13:00.000 through life and seeing where life took
00:13:02.399 me
00:13:03.200 one's it's not right or wrong but the
00:13:05.920 question is how can you become more
00:13:08.720 purposeful in the areas that matter i
00:13:12.399 love that you're mentioning this because
00:13:14.240 it's my opinion that a lot of people
00:13:16.480 listening to podcasts like this
00:13:18.720 are at different times in their life
00:13:20.480 different head spaces different
00:13:22.079 emotional states you're not always in
00:13:24.399 conquer mode now
00:13:26.560 you but you're often listening to people
00:13:28.240 telling their story of when they were in
00:13:30.560 conquer mode right you're not hearing
00:13:32.320 people get on a podcast to talk about
00:13:34.000 the great cup of coffee that they had
00:13:35.440 that morning and how soothing it was to
00:13:37.600 look out their window and see their
00:13:38.880 favorite plant blooming or whatever and
00:13:41.360 if you're not in conquer mode and you're
00:13:42.959 listening to someone who goes out there
00:13:44.399 and they talk like they're putting the
00:13:45.600 world on fire it's very easy to think
00:13:47.440 that that is how every other human being
00:13:49.199 operates all the time
00:13:50.959 especially if you're listening to a lot
00:13:52.240 of podcasts or a lot of youtube where
00:13:53.839 that's what people get on there to talk
00:13:55.199 about right and that makes sense because
00:13:57.199 i don't necessarily want to hear
00:13:58.480 somebody get on a podcast all the time
00:13:59.920 and talk about how
00:14:01.279 you know they caught every green light
00:14:02.639 to work that day and it was really nice
00:14:04.160 and that's all that there was right i
00:14:05.600 want to hear the stories that are
00:14:06.959 inspirational but that is not how life
00:14:08.639 is all the time none of us are at a dead
00:14:11.519 sprint constantly and my fear would be
00:14:14.240 if you hear this and you think this is
00:14:15.920 how everyone is living life all the time
00:14:17.760 you'll feel shame
00:14:19.040 you'll feel guilt you'll get this
00:14:20.320 thought like i should be doing more and
00:14:22.959 because i am not doing more i am a
00:14:24.720 failure and i shouldn't even get into
00:14:26.399 this whole real estate investing thing
00:14:27.839 or financial freedom or whatever it is
00:14:30.639 each of you what are your thoughts on
00:14:32.720 that perspective ladies first i say
00:14:36.560 preach david i'm sitting here thinking
00:14:39.360 to myself i have to pump my arms because
00:14:41.519 i have been in that position you know
00:14:43.680 life
00:14:45.199 can be overwhelming life will throw
00:14:47.360 things at you whether you're ready to
00:14:48.639 catch it or not and sometimes it catches
00:14:50.240 you on the side of the head
00:14:51.839 this is actually kind of spot on for me
00:14:54.000 this week both my daughter and my
00:14:55.920 husband tested positive for covid i've
00:14:57.920 had to kind of change what i was
00:14:59.920 planning on doing and focus on that
00:15:02.000 right now and
00:15:03.519 i am also
00:15:04.959 in a place where earlier this week i'm
00:15:07.199 like i have to set goals i am ready to
00:15:09.839 set goals and everything that you're
00:15:11.519 saying
00:15:12.639 i think needs to be taken in the context
00:15:14.720 of when you're ready to set goals you
00:15:16.720 can go and be the achiever and the
00:15:19.120 aggressive go-getter but when you're not
00:15:21.600 in a headspace to set those goals
00:15:24.800 it doesn't mean that you won't ever be
00:15:26.160 in the headspace to set those goals
00:15:27.600 think about it you know i i know i want
00:15:29.199 to accomplish something i'm listening to
00:15:30.480 this podcast i i am encouraged to do
00:15:33.440 these things
00:15:34.800 now is not the right time great put a
00:15:36.639 pin in it go back put a calendar invite
00:15:39.199 in a week in a month talk to yourself
00:15:42.160 in
00:15:43.199 the future and say hey are you ready to
00:15:45.040 set these goals now it needs to be
00:15:47.199 something that you're ready to do but
00:15:49.040 when you're ready to do it you need to
00:15:50.480 sit down
00:15:51.519 and make a plan and it's not just a five
00:15:54.320 minute okay boom i'm done it's kind of
00:15:56.079 an over
00:15:57.519 uh an ever evolving thing
00:16:00.320 um but i really really really like what
00:16:01.920 you're saying david not everybody has to
00:16:03.519 be in that space every minute of every
00:16:04.959 day and i think that there is a lot of
00:16:06.639 shame
00:16:07.600 surrounding that when you're not in that
00:16:09.680 space oh i had a unique perspective as
00:16:12.399 you were talking david which is you know
00:16:15.839 i'm the face of the one thing
00:16:18.160 i'm the poster child for it
00:16:20.480 and
00:16:21.519 even as you're speaking
00:16:23.680 i'm thinking of the various areas of my
00:16:26.399 life whether it be my spirituality my
00:16:28.160 physical health
00:16:29.440 my personal life my key relationships my
00:16:32.800 job insider organization our business
00:16:34.959 overall my finances there are certain
00:16:37.600 areas right now that i am incredibly
00:16:40.240 purposeful
00:16:41.519 and focused in taking action and there
00:16:43.920 are some areas right now that i am not
00:16:46.480 and i think it's important for people to
00:16:48.000 understand that you're a whole person
00:16:49.839 there are things that matter
00:16:50.720 professionally there are things that
00:16:51.920 matter personally you cannot be
00:16:54.880 purposeful in all areas at all time
00:16:58.639 there this is this is the fifth lie of
00:17:00.639 productivity it's the live a balanced
00:17:02.399 life it's not that you are perfectly
00:17:04.240 balanced you are constantly balancing
00:17:07.359 which means you are out of balance so
00:17:09.280 right now i am heavily focused on the
00:17:11.839 business side on the wealth building
00:17:13.599 side on the personal relationship side
00:17:15.839 but i have been less purposeful in my
00:17:19.039 health in my workout routine and my diet
00:17:21.280 had exercised the last three or four
00:17:23.119 months than i was in the prior year i've
00:17:25.599 gone out of balance so
00:17:28.720 my question for you who's listening to
00:17:30.160 this is
00:17:31.280 where in your life right now are you
00:17:32.640 being really purposeful are you focused
00:17:36.000 and where are the other areas of your
00:17:37.440 life right now that you're not as
00:17:39.440 focused and there's no shame in it
00:17:43.039 then we get to ask the question since
00:17:44.720 it's the time of year where it's time to
00:17:46.960 set our goals it's time to cast that
00:17:48.640 vision for the future it's to ask the
00:17:50.799 question how do i feel about that
00:17:52.799 what do i need to do differently
00:17:55.280 that's the purpose of this yeah what i
00:17:57.039 love about that is oftentimes the answer
00:17:59.679 is somewhere in your own gut or your
00:18:02.320 subconscious whatever you want to call
00:18:03.840 it it knows where you're needed you're
00:18:05.840 not coming through for your family
00:18:07.280 you're not coming through for your
00:18:08.240 friends you're not coming through in
00:18:09.280 your fitness whatever it may be
00:18:12.480 when you don't take that minute to just
00:18:14.320 be quiet and listen
00:18:16.400 it's easy to miss right like oftentimes
00:18:18.640 it speaks in a whisper but that next
00:18:20.960 deal coming at you or the next seminar
00:18:23.200 or a webinar you need to take or the
00:18:24.960 next podcast intro is a shout it is
00:18:27.039 screaming at you listen to me pay
00:18:28.640 attention to me do
00:18:30.240 what i'm doing and i know that during
00:18:32.559 covid a lot of people had those shouts
00:18:35.200 sort of taken away there was less things
00:18:37.360 screaming at us as we had a shelter in
00:18:39.200 place and the world that we had been
00:18:41.440 living in was kind of shaken up and all
00:18:43.200 the pieces fell together different so
00:18:44.880 i'm curious jeff if you could share a
00:18:46.640 little perspective on how you saw that
00:18:49.200 affect people and what shouts they
00:18:52.080 listen to and what whispers they heard
00:18:53.919 so here's what's interesting wow
00:18:56.559 what percent of the people that listen
00:18:57.919 to the show do you think have a day job
00:18:59.600 like they they work for a company and
00:19:01.360 they're looking to invest in real estate
00:19:02.799 on the side it's not their profession
00:19:04.320 yet that's the vast majority i would
00:19:06.080 guess 80 to 90 so
00:19:08.799 if you used to go to an office
00:19:10.960 you're used to having distractions of
00:19:12.960 people swinging by and asking hey do you
00:19:14.960 got a minute
00:19:16.559 when pandemic hit all of a sudden that
00:19:18.240 went away
00:19:19.360 all of a sudden when you were bored in
00:19:21.600 between meetings or tasks instead of
00:19:23.520 walking around and chatting with people
00:19:25.039 that you may or may not actually care
00:19:26.320 that much about you were hanging out
00:19:28.000 with your family
00:19:30.240 that was a silver lining on the flip
00:19:32.240 side a whole new set of challenges
00:19:34.720 occurred and this is from we work with
00:19:36.559 some of the largest companies in the
00:19:37.840 world on their future of work strategy
00:19:40.000 and what that's going to look like the
00:19:41.520 number of emails across the board went
00:19:43.280 through the roof
00:19:44.320 the number of meetings actually went up
00:19:46.160 the number of hours that people were
00:19:47.679 working actually went through the roof
00:19:49.120 because no longer did they have a drive
00:19:51.039 to or from the office they had no
00:19:53.200 delineation between
00:19:55.200 professional and personal
00:19:58.000 so these are different challenges that
00:20:00.640 happened
00:20:03.280 the problem is
00:20:05.280 there were a lot of people that said oh
00:20:06.720 this is only going to last for three
00:20:08.320 weeks
00:20:09.200 this is only going to last for a month
00:20:10.720 this is only going to last for a quarter
00:20:12.880 well it's lasted a lot longer and a lot
00:20:15.200 of people have normalized a way of
00:20:18.080 working and living that is not going to
00:20:20.559 help them live a life
00:20:23.200 that they're proud of
00:20:24.880 a lot of people have normalized new
00:20:27.600 habits that will actually lead toward
00:20:29.760 regret
00:20:31.760 so this is the time to actually pause
00:20:33.840 and say okay whatever's happened over
00:20:35.679 the last year to 18 months i have to
00:20:37.600 actually have a conversation with myself
00:20:39.120 and the people i do life with on what is
00:20:41.440 important to me how do i want to be
00:20:44.320 living and how do i view my time as an
00:20:46.400 investment that i hold accountable to
00:20:48.320 delivering a return and not something
00:20:49.919 that i have to spend or kill yeah that
00:20:52.320 entire
00:20:53.360 way that we frame this
00:20:55.280 this conversation is work life balance
00:20:57.760 and that implies there's work and then
00:20:59.600 there's life and you gotta go between
00:21:01.600 them but kobet really blurred the lines
00:21:03.520 between those what is work and what is
00:21:05.200 life at that point so i'm curious mindy
00:21:08.240 what was that experience like for you
00:21:10.080 where you're now working at home where
00:21:12.240 life typically is takes place
00:21:15.039 so i had actually been working from home
00:21:17.600 two days a week and working in the
00:21:18.880 office two days a week so it just
00:21:21.760 now i'm at home all the time which is
00:21:23.919 great i can start work earlier i get up
00:21:27.200 in the morning i can get some quiet time
00:21:29.520 in while i drink my coffee and check my
00:21:32.880 work email and do my work things and all
00:21:35.520 of a sudden i went from working eight
00:21:37.039 hours a day to probably more like 10 or
00:21:39.440 12 hours a day because at the end of the
00:21:41.679 day my kids were still home they were
00:21:44.240 home the whole day i didn't have to go
00:21:46.640 pick them up i didn't have to do
00:21:48.720 anything because everybody was here
00:21:50.880 i
00:21:51.919 want to say in the last four or five
00:21:54.559 months have intentionally had to stop
00:21:57.360 working on purpose in order to go have a
00:22:00.480 work-life balance and that
00:22:02.320 is i'm still getting up early and
00:22:03.919 drinking my coffee while i check my
00:22:05.200 email but i'm stopping when the girls
00:22:06.960 come home from school and i'm going out
00:22:09.039 to be mom instead of mindy from bigger
00:22:11.760 pockets and
00:22:13.360 it was it crept up on me because at
00:22:15.600 first you're like oh i just have one
00:22:17.039 more thing to do
00:22:18.320 i will always have one more thing to do
00:22:20.640 there is no shortage of anything and i'm
00:22:23.840 not
00:22:25.520 trying to diss my own job i love it i
00:22:27.280 think it's important but i'm not
00:22:28.559 performing brain surgery i can stop
00:22:30.720 today and i can start answering
00:22:32.400 questions about real estate and talking
00:22:34.240 about money tomorrow and the world will
00:22:37.120 keep on revolving so
00:22:39.120 i think there's there's
00:22:42.159 it's really hard for people to
00:22:45.520 make that delineation and if you're not
00:22:47.440 intentional with that
00:22:49.120 that stop and it's a hard stop it has to
00:22:51.520 be just i answered that email i'm
00:22:53.600 getting up and leaving yeah i'm always
00:22:55.120 going to have more emails in my inbox
00:22:56.880 i'm always going to have something else
00:22:58.240 to do so stop and continue on
00:23:01.600 david how did you stop it
00:23:04.480 you know i'm i'm sort of hesitant to say
00:23:06.799 this because i don't want to sound crass
00:23:09.360 the pandemic was one of the best things
00:23:10.960 that ever happened for my personal life
00:23:12.880 and my work life
00:23:14.159 i started eating way better because i
00:23:16.080 wasn't driving from appointment to
00:23:17.600 appointment to appointment and trying to
00:23:18.960 get fast food in between the busyness of
00:23:21.120 everything i drive all over northern
00:23:22.640 california constantly
00:23:24.559 and when we got to a point where sellers
00:23:26.559 were okay to do a zoom call or went over
00:23:28.480 their house and they sent us a video of
00:23:30.080 what it looked like
00:23:31.840 that's all i needed i mean when you know
00:23:33.760 how the numbers of real estate work and
00:23:36.559 you have professionals that can do stuff
00:23:38.480 it's very similar to my long-distance
00:23:40.159 investing concept where the photographer
00:23:42.559 will show up at your house and they will
00:23:44.000 tell me what needs to be put in place so
00:23:45.760 that this can work i don't actually have
00:23:47.919 to go see it but the clients they like
00:23:49.760 that they like you to go look at the
00:23:51.840 house and covet kind of handled that
00:23:54.080 problem for me now they're not expecting
00:23:56.080 me to be there
00:23:57.360 um i still had people we were still
00:23:59.919 working we just worked out of my house
00:24:01.600 because the offices were all shut down
00:24:04.559 and it created a better relationship and
00:24:07.039 communication between all the parties we
00:24:08.720 were right there next to each other
00:24:10.240 there was this camaraderie that was
00:24:11.760 developed like we're in the foxhole
00:24:13.360 together we watched our production go up
00:24:15.679 well a lot of other peoples went down it
00:24:17.600 gave a lot of confidence to the people
00:24:19.120 on my team that i was the right leader
00:24:21.200 to be leading them um i could go like i
00:24:24.159 was able to exercise because i was at
00:24:25.760 home so when i would just get like
00:24:27.200 stressed out from a client i would just
00:24:28.640 go for a run or i'd go do pull-ups
00:24:30.240 outside or i'd go it was in the
00:24:31.760 summertime so i could go get sunshine
00:24:33.360 and then when my body was tired from
00:24:34.640 exercising i could come back in and my
00:24:36.159 mind had had a chance to rest right so
00:24:37.919 like my productivity actually increased
00:24:40.159 because i didn't sit there and try to
00:24:41.919 like work out the tired part of my body
00:24:44.000 or my mind all the time when i was tired
00:24:46.400 of analyzing things i would get on the
00:24:47.919 phone and talk to clients and have a
00:24:49.279 conversation where emotions were more
00:24:51.520 involved so from my perspective the
00:24:53.679 pandemic was actually very helpful and i
00:24:56.320 i'm hesitant to say that because for the
00:24:58.240 majority people i don't think it was i
00:24:59.679 think it shook people up i think it
00:25:01.120 created a lot of pain and i really want
00:25:02.640 to be
00:25:03.520 sensitive towards that but what is
00:25:05.600 important to take from it is that it
00:25:07.440 exposed what we were doing on autopilot
00:25:10.400 that we assumed was normal whether that
00:25:13.039 was good or not if you were not living
00:25:15.279 intentionally you had no way of knowing
00:25:17.360 that you weren't living intentionally
00:25:18.559 because you get up you drink your coffee
00:25:19.919 you go on your commute you go to the
00:25:21.200 office you punch in you may do nothing
00:25:23.120 of use the entire time but you get paid
00:25:24.640 for eight hours then you drive back home
00:25:26.480 you told yourself i'm done with work now
00:25:28.000 i start life you do whatever this really
00:25:30.559 just erased all those lines right it was
00:25:32.799 kind of like the matrix like you thought
00:25:34.240 you were living in a normal world and
00:25:35.760 now you're born into a new world and you
00:25:37.520 really have to look at it
00:25:39.279 um and that's where i think
00:25:41.840 conversations like this are so helpful
00:25:43.520 to people because really none of that
00:25:45.600 world was real it was just what we were
00:25:47.279 used to
00:25:48.159 right
00:25:49.279 the creating the life you want is about
00:25:51.520 intention it usually doesn't happen to
00:25:53.279 you and something like this really
00:25:55.200 expose that jeff i saw that you look
00:25:56.720 like you had some uh some insight to
00:25:58.480 offer there
00:25:59.520 what stops us from reinventing ourself
00:26:01.440 is an attachment to the way things used
00:26:03.520 to be
00:26:04.559 we were attached to a way of thinking a
00:26:06.799 way of behaving
00:26:09.039 and it this gave us the op it forced
00:26:12.320 many of us to reinvent how we do what we
00:26:16.159 do and there are many of us listening
00:26:18.000 this who are saying there are certain
00:26:19.279 things that i'm not gonna go back to the
00:26:22.720 old way because i have discovered an
00:26:25.120 even better way that's just what's
00:26:27.360 sticking with me
00:26:28.480 so how does somebody discover the even
00:26:31.120 better way how can somebody start like
00:26:34.400 mindy from six months ago who was like
00:26:36.799 oh i get up in the morning and i'm
00:26:38.480 putting in 12 hour days
00:26:40.799 i
00:26:42.159 i'm in a probably a bit of a different
00:26:44.240 position i get to talk to a lot of
00:26:45.600 different people who talk about goals
00:26:46.960 and i mean you think something would
00:26:48.400 have sucked sooner but one we're going
00:26:49.919 to get to see an example of this later
00:26:51.440 with jordan and john but this is this is
00:26:53.600 part of our process that we walk through
00:26:55.679 in the goal-setting retreat that we
00:26:56.880 facilitate
00:26:58.640 at the core of the one thing
00:27:00.880 is the skill of asking big questions
00:27:04.799 and searching for big answers
00:27:07.279 now big questions are questions that you
00:27:09.679 get asked and you have to stop and go
00:27:13.679 huh great question
00:27:16.159 and a lot of people don't know how to
00:27:18.559 search for the answer they hit the wall
00:27:21.120 of i don't know here's a perfect one
00:27:23.760 what would an extraordinary life look
00:27:25.039 like in 20 years
00:27:27.039 go
00:27:28.559 most people would say i don't know but
00:27:30.240 they stop the search we have to first
00:27:32.799 foremost understand you have to search
00:27:35.039 for the answer so part of this process
00:27:37.679 is before we even talk about the goals
00:27:41.039 that you want to set we have to go
00:27:43.360 deeper
00:27:44.399 we have to understand what your values
00:27:45.840 are
00:27:48.159 why do you do what you do every single
00:27:51.039 one of us or
00:27:52.320 there's an author called jonathan named
00:27:53.679 jonathan height he wrote a book called
00:27:55.039 the the happiness hypothesis and in it
00:27:57.520 he writes about the writer and the
00:27:59.120 elephant
00:28:00.320 and it's you you can imagine a little
00:28:02.080 kid sitting on top of a big an elephant
00:28:04.159 going for a ride and imagine if the kid
00:28:06.399 had a stick and he taps the elephant's
00:28:08.559 right ear and the elephant goes right he
00:28:10.399 taps the elephant's left ear the
00:28:11.760 elephant goes left who's really who's in
00:28:13.679 charge
00:28:15.039 yet if the kid tapped the elephant's
00:28:16.720 right ear
00:28:18.000 and the elephant went left
00:28:19.919 you'd realize who is actually in charge
00:28:23.039 it's the elephant there's nothing that
00:28:24.640 kid can do about it every single one of
00:28:26.880 us has a rider and an elephant
00:28:29.279 our rider is our logical mind it's our
00:28:32.000 the goals that we set it's the things we
00:28:34.000 say we're going to do yet our elephant
00:28:36.000 is our purpose and our core values and
00:28:38.240 whether you realize what your purpose
00:28:40.559 and values are or not they're actually
00:28:43.200 there you have a top three core values
00:28:46.799 that drive every decision you make every
00:28:49.360 one of us knows what it feels like to
00:28:50.880 make a decision that lights us up
00:28:52.720 they're in alignment with your values
00:28:54.559 and every one of us knows what it feels
00:28:56.159 like to make a decision
00:28:58.559 it is out of alignment with our values
00:29:00.320 because it's you feel the conflict
00:29:03.200 but if you don't know what your values
00:29:05.679 are
00:29:06.399 you cannot make great decisions
00:29:10.480 so the first part is to understand what
00:29:12.320 the heck your values are we have a
00:29:14.399 simple process for that and once you
00:29:16.559 have that you then cast the vision for
00:29:18.960 some day you can figure out 10 years 20
00:29:21.600 years however far that is and you
00:29:23.760 genuinely start to search for the answer
00:29:25.360 like mindy i guarantee if i ask you you
00:29:27.120 know
00:29:28.000 in 10 years what would extraordinary
00:29:29.840 finances look like
00:29:31.760 and if you sat down with a pen and a
00:29:33.200 piece of paper and really searched
00:29:35.520 you could come up with some ideas
00:29:37.600 what would extraordinary relationships
00:29:39.279 look like imagine the relationships with
00:29:41.120 your kids in 10 or 20 years describe it
00:29:43.760 what would it look like if you gave
00:29:45.760 yourself the space you could come up
00:29:47.279 with answers
00:29:48.559 you do this for the various areas of
00:29:50.320 your life and all of a sudden you have a
00:29:51.600 lot of things that you
00:29:53.279 could
00:29:54.559 turn into goals
00:29:56.720 but we know that everything does not
00:29:58.159 matter equally
00:30:00.080 that you look at all the things you
00:30:01.360 could focus on and you ask the question
00:30:02.960 what are the ones the few that if i
00:30:05.760 really focused on these would make the
00:30:08.320 biggest impact for me and you reverse
00:30:11.039 engineer that and work them backwards to
00:30:12.960 goals that you can focus on for the next
00:30:15.360 year and take action against on a
00:30:17.360 monthly and weekly basis and you'll be
00:30:19.440 blown away at how much you can
00:30:21.600 accomplish
00:30:22.720 what goes through your head mindy when
00:30:24.000 you hear that
00:30:25.520 i have some work ahead of me and i
00:30:29.200 am excited for that work i am at a place
00:30:31.600 where this is something that i want this
00:30:34.559 is something that i have time to focus
00:30:36.240 on and this is something that
00:30:38.960 uh
00:30:43.440 this is something i want i have time to
00:30:44.960 focus on and i will be able to
00:30:46.880 accomplish because i'm going to be
00:30:48.799 giving myself time like i said before i
00:30:51.520 haven't been
00:30:52.799 uh intentional with my time life has
00:30:55.039 kind of been pulling me along and you
00:30:57.039 know life will pull you along life is
00:30:58.880 what what is that quote life is what
00:31:00.640 happens when you are busy making other
00:31:02.320 plans life is going to just pull you
00:31:04.399 along until you focus and tell life
00:31:06.000 where you want to go
00:31:07.360 and you said something that's really
00:31:08.880 important there mindy
00:31:10.399 you said i'm going to make the time
00:31:13.120 for you who's listening to this
00:31:15.679 if i talk about you know your top
00:31:17.679 knowing your top three core values
00:31:19.279 having clarity on life someday from now
00:31:21.440 and being able to take based on that
00:31:23.039 here's what i need to accomplish in five
00:31:24.399 years here's what i got to accomplish in
00:31:25.679 the next 12 months this drives a lot of
00:31:27.519 focus on what i have to do and by the
00:31:28.960 end of this month which means this is
00:31:30.320 what has to be on my calendar this week
00:31:32.159 if you cannot draw that line
00:31:34.559 by the way
00:31:36.000 zero judgment
00:31:38.240 yet i would ask if i followed you around
00:31:40.240 with a camera for the last three months
00:31:41.919 how much time would we see you
00:31:44.399 having invested in seeking that clarity
00:31:48.159 the answer is probably none or very
00:31:50.159 little and again zero judgment but
00:31:55.200 your actions drive your results
00:31:57.919 if you want different results we have to
00:32:00.320 change your actions which means frankly
00:32:02.559 i have you we got to start seeing things
00:32:04.880 shift on your calendar you need to start
00:32:07.200 blocking time for these types of
00:32:09.600 questions and searching for those
00:32:11.200 answers you know i think the vast
00:32:13.919 majority of us i think the default of
00:32:16.000 human nature
00:32:17.440 is to let the elephant carry us where
00:32:20.080 it's going to carry us and make the most
00:32:21.919 of wherever we go
00:32:23.679 so some of us grow up in homes where we
00:32:26.399 have parents that do a better job than
00:32:28.559 others of helping train our elephants
00:32:30.159 and so we end up on a path that will
00:32:32.159 lead us more likely to prosperity or
00:32:34.240 better or better relationships or more
00:32:36.080 emotional control
00:32:37.600 others of us don't have parents or our
00:32:39.440 parents had crazy elephants or we had
00:32:41.279 good parents but other things came up in
00:32:42.880 life that affected our elephant and it
00:32:44.960 keeps taking us into like the part of
00:32:47.200 the of the jungle where all the tigers
00:32:49.279 are you just keep doing self-sabotaging
00:32:51.519 behavior there's probably all kinds of
00:32:53.200 scenarios we could list but the point is
00:32:55.840 we don't think it's our responsibility
00:32:58.000 to train that elephant we just go with
00:32:59.760 where it goes and we take what comes our
00:33:01.360 way is what you're talking about here
00:33:03.360 jeff ways that you can take control of
00:33:05.840 that elephant and make it go where you
00:33:07.919 intentionally would like it to
00:33:09.760 it's the opposite
00:33:11.360 okay it's not controlling the elephant
00:33:14.399 it's controlling the rider
00:33:17.679 your elephant is your core values
00:33:20.320 you don't get to pick them they are when
00:33:22.480 people do this exercise to identify
00:33:24.159 their values oftentimes they feel pulled
00:33:26.080 to choose aspirational values like this
00:33:28.399 i want this to be a value of mine i wish
00:33:30.559 this was the value of mine i feel guilty
00:33:32.960 that this is not a value of mine that's
00:33:35.519 family for a lot of people they want to
00:33:37.600 say families one of their values but
00:33:39.200 it's actually not one of the top three
00:33:41.600 your values are your values the question
00:33:44.880 is how do you train your rider
00:33:47.440 your logical mind
00:33:49.679 to set goals that are in alignment with
00:33:52.000 your values to make choices that are in
00:33:54.559 alignment with your values to seek
00:33:56.720 opportunities that are in alignment with
00:33:59.600 your values
00:34:02.480 and this is huge because one of the
00:34:04.159 biggest one of the biggest places that
00:34:07.360 people spend or invest their time
00:34:10.399 is their j o b
00:34:14.159 more time
00:34:15.520 in their professional life than they do
00:34:17.359 with their family but most people have
00:34:19.679 never actually paused and asked
00:34:22.560 is what i do professionally in alignment
00:34:25.359 with my values like my top three are
00:34:27.679 growth recognition and impact
00:34:31.359 is my job aligned with those it actually
00:34:33.760 is because i've been very purposeful in
00:34:36.239 designing a role
00:34:38.719 where every day i live my values it's
00:34:41.199 why you hear the passion in my voice i
00:34:43.280 am growing every day i have recognition
00:34:46.399 it's not like jeff high five or kudos
00:34:48.480 but like doing this having this type of
00:34:50.560 conversation is recognition for me and
00:34:52.639 the impact like mindy i'm watching your
00:34:54.320 face
00:34:55.280 as i can i can see your brain processing
00:34:58.160 that's impact for me
00:35:00.000 this lights me up i'm on fire right now
00:35:03.680 so but that has been intentional
00:35:05.920 because once i knew what my core values
00:35:08.000 were then i had a conversation with jay
00:35:10.320 pappas and my partner about how do i
00:35:13.040 bring the most value to our organization
00:35:15.440 while making sure they are in alignment
00:35:17.200 with my values we have been very
00:35:19.280 purposeful in scripting that role and
00:35:21.359 then me hiring people to take the things
00:35:24.240 off my plate that are not in alignment
00:35:27.040 with my values
00:35:29.119 so it's more about focusing on the
00:35:31.119 writer it's focusing on you
00:35:33.359 having clarity on what your values are
00:35:35.760 and then making sure that you choose
00:35:37.280 goals and and take actions that are in
00:35:39.280 alignment with them what do you think
00:35:40.880 about that mindy is your brain hurt yet
00:35:42.960 i think that you're kind of inside my
00:35:45.200 brain like did you did you read my mind
00:35:47.520 while i was while i was getting ready
00:35:49.200 this morning it's it's really
00:35:52.240 but also
00:35:53.359 i'm in a place where i am not only ready
00:35:55.839 to take action i am
00:35:58.560 i've found the time to sit down and take
00:36:01.520 action and you haven't found the time
00:36:03.200 you've prioritized it oh
00:36:05.359 oh
00:36:06.480 that's good
00:36:07.680 you and i have the same 24 hours in the
00:36:09.599 day
00:36:10.480 yes we do it's just a matter of are you
00:36:12.400 making it a priority or not i'll tell
00:36:14.320 you something i do not make a priority
00:36:16.160 email i'll tell you another thing i do
00:36:18.000 not make a priority facebook twitter
00:36:20.560 instagram don't do it it's not a 20
00:36:23.599 activity that is going to drive 80 plus
00:36:26.240 of my results not to say that i don't
00:36:28.960 ever check email or go on social media
00:36:32.720 but you if you followed me around with
00:36:34.320 the camera you would not see that being
00:36:36.400 a meaningful part of my life
00:36:38.320 what do you prioritize my 20
00:36:41.280 i am clear that and when i say my 20 i
00:36:43.920 mean the 20 things i can do to drive 80
00:36:46.400 of the results and i am so clear our
00:36:48.560 definition of a job description is not
00:36:50.320 everything that you have to do it's the
00:36:52.000 two to three things you have to do
00:36:53.119 exceptionally well or you should be
00:36:54.400 fired from your role
00:36:56.800 and as the president of this company i
00:36:59.119 have three priorities
00:37:00.800 casting a vision
00:37:02.880 driving revenue
00:37:04.560 and being an ambassador of the brand so
00:37:06.320 having this conversation checks number
00:37:08.000 three
00:37:10.079 and if you looked at my calendar
00:37:12.560 you would actually see it's color coded
00:37:14.880 over 80 percent of my work week
00:37:18.240 is invested
00:37:19.920 in 20
00:37:21.440 priorities that drive 80 of the results
00:37:27.200 yes i still check email yes i still go
00:37:29.040 to some team meetings yes i still have
00:37:30.720 to like
00:37:31.760 check some people's work from time to
00:37:33.760 time that's my that's 80 stuff
00:37:36.480 but that's the minority of my time
00:37:39.040 and i'm gonna say
00:37:40.960 this has been a journey i've been living
00:37:42.400 the one thing for six years i've gotten
00:37:44.480 here over time it's not like i listened
00:37:46.560 to a podcast episode or read the book
00:37:48.320 and boom the next day my calendar
00:37:50.960 switched it happened over time
00:37:55.040 but
00:37:56.480 you said something mindy that i think
00:37:58.079 that i think that really resonated with
00:37:59.760 me you said you sip your coffee and you
00:38:01.520 check your email
00:38:03.280 i remember it was pro it was it was six
00:38:05.359 years ago because it was my first month
00:38:07.200 on the job i remember my alarm going off
00:38:09.760 in the morning
00:38:10.960 i remember snoozing a bunch of times and
00:38:13.599 once it was time to wake up i remember
00:38:15.359 checking my email
00:38:17.440 while still in bed and i remember you
00:38:19.680 ever had one of those emails that you
00:38:21.119 open it and it's a bomb and you're like
00:38:22.800 oh i can't deal with this right now and
00:38:24.320 your market is unread
00:38:25.920 that happened to me
00:38:27.680 i got out of bed and i remember
00:38:32.079 with my kids for breakfast
00:38:34.400 but i wasn't with my kids
00:38:36.720 i was still thinking about that email
00:38:38.960 and it hit me so hard
00:38:41.839 that when i wake up and check email
00:38:44.160 first thing
00:38:45.359 it occupies my mind share and steals my
00:38:48.160 focus and my presence from the people
00:38:50.400 and the priorities that matter most
00:38:52.800 and so my very first habit that i formed
00:38:55.200 with this company was to check my 4-1-1
00:38:57.839 before i checked my email a 411 is a
00:39:00.800 tool we have that gives you clarity on
00:39:02.160 your priorities for the year the month
00:39:03.280 and the week personally and
00:39:04.160 professionally before i even earned the
00:39:06.560 right to open my inbox i had to look at
00:39:08.880 a sheet of paper that showed me my
00:39:11.040 priorities were and here's what was
00:39:12.240 interesting mindy is when the moment i
00:39:14.079 looked at my priorities
00:39:16.079 i felt compelled to start knocking that
00:39:19.040 first domino down
00:39:21.920 and when i started having clarity on the
00:39:24.000 thing that matters most and taking
00:39:25.760 action on the thing that matters most
00:39:27.440 first thing in the day
00:39:29.359 i stopped artificially inflating the
00:39:32.400 importance of my inbox
00:39:35.839 i discovered that my most important
00:39:37.599 priorities do not live in my inbox and
00:39:39.599 if it happens to be in there it's
00:39:41.119 usually followed up with a phone call
00:39:45.359 so i didn't check my email till later in
00:39:47.760 the day and then i hired an executive
00:39:49.440 assistant who her job is to check email
00:39:51.520 the things i need to see i have two
00:39:53.359 folders i check a for today folder and a
00:39:55.680 for this week i just checked the today
00:39:57.440 folder and there's maybe two or three
00:39:58.640 emails in there a day that i need to see
00:40:00.640 and respond to every and i don't need to
00:40:03.040 do anything else with my inbox now yeah
00:40:04.960 i would imagine that type of clarity
00:40:07.440 makes it pretty
00:40:09.119 easy comparatively speaking when it
00:40:10.960 comes to what jobs you're going to take
00:40:12.800 on
00:40:13.520 what responsibilities you're going to
00:40:15.440 move forward with what tasks are
00:40:17.359 appropriate
00:40:18.560 it helps avoid that analysis paralysis
00:40:20.720 that so many people fall into when they
00:40:22.400 don't have that clarity of where you're
00:40:23.920 going so all right and we have a treat
00:40:26.160 for our bp listeners today because we've
00:40:28.480 got two guests that jeff is going to
00:40:30.400 interview that are going to share what
00:40:32.560 they've done in their business and in
00:40:34.240 their personal life since first being
00:40:36.319 introduced to this concept of
00:40:37.920 intentional goal setting and then maybe
00:40:40.000 if we're lucky jeff can sort of walk
00:40:41.760 them through what the future will look
00:40:43.680 like what their next steps will be so
00:40:45.839 without further ado jordan john welcome
00:40:48.720 to the podcast how are you today doing
00:40:50.640 great thanks for having us on doing well
00:40:52.720 thank you yeah jeff i'm gonna let you
00:40:54.720 take it away yeah so jordan john why
00:40:57.280 don't you give us the the high level 20
00:40:59.760 of what you do professionally so what we
00:41:02.880 do professionally john and i own a home
00:41:05.359 buying business
00:41:06.880 where we find and purchase single family
00:41:10.000 homes we do the birth strategy that
00:41:11.839 david green talks about in his book but
00:41:14.480 we do that as a business
00:41:16.640 and
00:41:17.599 we have separate businesses that we do
00:41:19.839 on our own together that is our primary
00:41:22.640 business buying homes in louisville i
00:41:24.560 love that i love that and
00:41:26.400 jordan i know last year you attended our
00:41:28.319 one thing goal-setting retreat for
00:41:29.760 couples and individuals
00:41:31.440 john you did or were not a part of that
00:41:33.440 last year i was not a part of that last
00:41:35.599 year
00:41:36.400 so jordan you did it with your
00:41:37.440 girlfriend yeah we loved it absolutely
00:41:40.560 i'm curious what was going on in your
00:41:43.040 life when you heard the idea
00:41:46.000 of the one thing goal setting retreat
00:41:47.680 that made you say
00:41:49.599 i we should actually look at this this
00:41:50.960 year so
00:41:52.640 i think
00:41:53.520 we
00:41:54.560 we have similar goals but we weren't 100
00:41:57.760 aligned on how we were going to get
00:41:59.599 there and exactly what we were working
00:42:01.599 towards
00:42:02.560 so
00:42:03.440 my girlfriend and i saw it
00:42:06.000 thought hey you know this could be great
00:42:08.240 for us we did it and absolutely just
00:42:11.280 loved every minute of it we signed up
00:42:13.280 for the in-person version this year and
00:42:15.760 they're coming oh yeah absolutely see
00:42:18.000 you there man yeah i'm excited most
00:42:20.720 people so there's two tracks there's a
00:42:22.720 track for couples there's a track for
00:42:24.000 individuals
00:42:25.280 most people listening to this who have a
00:42:26.880 significant other
00:42:28.640 one is a goal setter and one is not
00:42:31.200 that's the norm are you both goal
00:42:32.960 setters or is one of you not as much
00:42:35.680 i am an intense goal setter and have
00:42:38.319 been for a long time i'm very focused on
00:42:41.440 my goals so it gets hard for me when i'm
00:42:44.160 only focused on the goals and forget
00:42:45.920 about everything else what about her
00:42:48.000 would she classify herself as a goal
00:42:49.680 setter she absolutely is and she's
00:42:52.720 growing into more of one since i've been
00:42:54.880 together for the last few years did you
00:42:56.800 guys have any doubts going into it or
00:42:58.960 any question marks
00:43:00.560 oh absolutely we had question marks but
00:43:03.359 we were up for the challenge and we're
00:43:04.880 really excited to do it what were some
00:43:06.640 of them i think
00:43:08.160 the biggest ones were are we not going
00:43:10.400 to be aligned now where we want to go
00:43:12.160 and is this going to make things
00:43:14.079 uncomfortable or difficult and it did
00:43:16.400 the exact opposite tell me more we were
00:43:18.960 able to implement we do a monthly life
00:43:21.280 dinner we go over our goals all the time
00:43:24.160 but
00:43:25.359 when we went through the couple's
00:43:27.040 goal-setting retreat process we actually
00:43:29.680 realized that we're a lot more aligned
00:43:31.359 than we would have ever thought and it
00:43:33.119 was because of the questions that were
00:43:34.880 asked the questions were so insightful
00:43:37.440 and just hit you right in the right spot
00:43:39.359 that you never think about on your own
00:43:42.240 and of course there's ton
00:43:44.240 we were a little surprised by how much
00:43:46.640 how many paper work how much paperwork
00:43:48.640 there was and how many things we were
00:43:50.160 going to have to fill out
00:43:51.920 but
00:43:53.359 we really enjoyed that nonetheless
00:43:55.680 well mindy this goes back to what we
00:43:57.280 were saying earlier about if the
00:43:58.800 foundation of the one thing is asking
00:44:00.319 questions and searching for answers
00:44:02.800 most people don't have the right
00:44:04.000 questions so they don't search for them
00:44:06.160 that is a really good point um there's
00:44:11.119 how do i know what to ask if i don't
00:44:12.480 know what to ask
00:44:14.319 and where this came from is so my
00:44:16.079 partner jay papasan he and his wife
00:44:17.440 wendy have been doing this for over 15
00:44:18.880 years and the first year they just they
00:44:20.960 got out of their house they got a
00:44:22.160 babysitter for the kids and they just
00:44:24.079 sat down for a weekend
00:44:26.480 and asked questions how is our marriage
00:44:29.440 what do we want out of life what do we
00:44:30.960 need to focus on when it comes to our
00:44:32.160 kids what do we need to focus on when it
00:44:33.440 comes to our parents who are getting
00:44:35.200 older how's our sex life oh my gosh dare
00:44:37.119 i ask that uh
00:44:38.960 but they asked questions and had honest
00:44:40.560 conversations and over a decade you know
00:44:43.760 you start to put some framework behind
00:44:45.680 this and some process and you really
00:44:47.440 make it a well-oiled machine and like
00:44:49.359 you're saying jordan you guys end up
00:44:50.720 having some amazingly rich conversations
00:44:53.760 where you realize
00:44:56.000 it's not actually about us having the
00:44:57.920 same answer
00:44:59.839 it's about alignment
00:45:03.040 what matters to jordan jordan what's
00:45:04.640 your girlfriend's name jessica
00:45:07.119 what matters to jessica and how can you
00:45:09.839 validate
00:45:11.440 that you hear that this matters to
00:45:12.960 jessica jessica hears that it matters to
00:45:14.640 you jordan and that you support one
00:45:16.560 another
00:45:17.520 i
00:45:18.480 earlier this week gary keller was doing
00:45:20.079 a mastermind and he drew something out
00:45:21.680 that just blew my mind he said here's
00:45:24.640 the problem in a relationship opposites
00:45:27.200 attract
00:45:28.720 because they complete you
00:45:31.040 but by definition of them being uh an
00:45:33.359 opposite they're naturally going to
00:45:34.880 drive you crazy
00:45:37.040 and the problem is is that person one
00:45:40.319 tries to get person two to change to be
00:45:42.560 more like them and person two is trying
00:45:44.800 to get person one to change to be more
00:45:46.560 like them versus you stepping back and
00:45:48.880 asking how do we honor the essence of
00:45:51.599 what makes you you
00:45:53.599 and expand the kind of life that we can
00:45:55.920 live together
00:45:58.160 and that's really what this is about
00:46:01.359 i'm curious jordan what was a goal that
00:46:03.440 the two of you set
00:46:05.520 that deep down you weren't sure if you'd
00:46:08.640 even be able to achieve it and you guys
00:46:10.319 crushed it in the last year
00:46:12.319 so i think our our goal in the last year
00:46:16.800 had a lot of had a lot to do with us
00:46:18.880 coming together to achieve our personal
00:46:20.960 goals she wanted to buy another rental
00:46:23.040 property it seemed a little out of reach
00:46:25.440 and i was absolutely able to do a lot of
00:46:27.680 help with that i'm a real estate agent
00:46:29.920 and i had some goals financially and
00:46:32.319 physically i'm in the best shape of my
00:46:34.000 life now that we were able to support
00:46:36.240 each other in
00:46:37.440 and
00:46:38.240 yeah we've crushed those goals so i love
00:46:41.599 that
00:46:42.800 i really liked that we were able to come
00:46:45.599 together and i love what you were
00:46:46.720 talking about how opposites attract
00:46:49.599 we're we're very very different
00:46:52.160 and that's great but we had a different
00:46:55.040 idea of how our lives were going to go
00:46:57.200 but now we see how those can work
00:46:59.040 together and how it can be harmonious
00:47:01.440 rather than be very different
00:47:03.599 yeah i love that what was something that
00:47:06.960 surprised you going through this process
00:47:09.760 i think a lot of how personal the
00:47:12.000 questions were you talked about stuff
00:47:14.000 about sex life and
00:47:16.000 and just from really personal questions
00:47:18.160 about family and about values that we
00:47:21.520 hadn't
00:47:22.400 i liked you also said you wouldn't think
00:47:24.160 to answer that ask these questions we
00:47:26.559 would never think to talk about that
00:47:28.240 stuff we just assumed or said hey this
00:47:30.960 is how i feel i'm not going to talk
00:47:32.960 about it but when it's written down and
00:47:35.359 you need to answer that question on
00:47:37.040 those sheets
00:47:38.480 it comes out and it
00:47:40.079 it might be way more aligned than you
00:47:41.680 would have ever thought but i would have
00:47:43.520 never thought to ask a question isn't it
00:47:45.200 kind of interesting how the person who's
00:47:47.280 supposed to be your life partner you
00:47:48.800 feel you can't ask questions to we all
00:47:50.880 feel that way
00:47:53.040 so interesting mindy were you going to
00:47:54.559 say something i was just going to
00:47:56.000 reiterate
00:47:57.119 what you said earlier you don't have to
00:47:59.599 have the same goals you just need to be
00:48:02.079 in alignment and i keep hearing that
00:48:03.760 from jordan as well
00:48:05.440 i think that can be kind of a block for
00:48:07.920 some people oh i want to go to this
00:48:10.559 goal-setting retreat or i want to sit
00:48:12.240 down and have have you know a
00:48:13.839 conversation about goals but the last
00:48:15.440 time we talked about it like you said
00:48:17.119 opposites attract the last time we
00:48:18.559 talked about it we were so off
00:48:21.119 how off are you really if you're
00:48:22.960 together i mean one person isn't going
00:48:24.880 to say i want to live in poverty for the
00:48:26.319 rest of my life while the other person
00:48:27.520 says i want to be the richest person in
00:48:29.280 the world your goals if you're together
00:48:32.480 i don't think that your goals are going
00:48:34.559 to be that far off that you can't find
00:48:37.440 alignment but like jordan said you have
00:48:40.240 to ask really personal questions
00:48:42.480 and
00:48:43.440 that's difficult i've been married for
00:48:45.200 almost 20 years there's still some
00:48:47.359 things that we don't talk about on a
00:48:48.960 real regular basis goals is one of them
00:48:51.839 although we
00:48:53.200 are getting there i heard something this
00:48:54.640 morning from one of our corporate
00:48:56.079 clients he was talking about leadership
00:48:57.440 but it totally applies to marriage and
00:48:59.280 relationships
00:49:01.200 you aren't compatible or not compatible
00:49:04.000 with someone compatibility is something
00:49:06.319 that's created
00:49:09.040 you have to create compatibility you
00:49:11.440 have to focus on it and mindy you've
00:49:13.440 been married for 20 years what's the key
00:49:15.119 what's the key to a successful marriage
00:49:16.640 it's one word
00:49:17.839 conversations and communication yeah
00:49:21.040 i've also heard compromise
00:49:23.599 right and
00:49:25.119 at the end of the day it's about
00:49:26.880 understanding what matters to you them
00:49:29.040 understanding what matters to me and
00:49:31.200 being able to ask the question how do i
00:49:33.040 validate that i see you i hear you how
00:49:35.200 do i support you where it matters most
00:49:36.800 how do you support me and how do we have
00:49:38.720 our shared goals the other thing i think
00:49:40.640 we need to acknowledge is the fact the
00:49:42.480 vast majority listening to this if you
00:49:44.000 have a significant other the other one
00:49:45.520 is not a goal setter
00:49:47.280 let me tell you what not to do
00:49:49.119 do not say honey do you want to go to a
00:49:51.119 couple's goal setting retreat this year
00:49:52.960 i would not i would not ask that
00:49:54.559 question
00:49:56.559 a different approach is to say hey
00:49:59.119 i care about you and i've realized
00:50:03.440 i'm not a hundred percent clear on how i
00:50:05.599 can be the best partner to you because i
00:50:07.440 don't actually
00:50:08.559 i'm not clear on what you want over the
00:50:10.400 long term and i i don't think i've done
00:50:12.319 a good enough job of communicating what
00:50:13.839 matters to me so i want to do a better
00:50:15.920 job of supporting you next year i hope
00:50:17.680 you can do a better job of supporting me
00:50:19.599 and i want to take a weekend where we
00:50:21.040 get out of our normal environment and we
00:50:23.680 get to know each other better
00:50:25.680 and so that this next year we can be
00:50:27.760 even better partners to one another
00:50:29.839 that's how you position it john what's
00:50:32.000 your experience been like working with
00:50:33.839 jordan uh it's been good so jordan and i
00:50:36.160 actually knew each other from high
00:50:37.359 school and he moved away like probably
00:50:40.559 when he was 18 or 17. and we kind of
00:50:43.280 disconnected and we connected back up i
00:50:45.440 actually was doing
00:50:46.960 some investments in louisville just um
00:50:49.440 starting out with single family rentals
00:50:51.200 and uh
00:50:53.119 long story short we
00:50:54.720 we rekindled that relationship and um to
00:50:57.680 circle back around it's been good i've
00:50:59.119 known jordan a long time
00:51:01.119 and uh he's uh it's been good we we have
00:51:03.839 kind of a system in place where jordan's
00:51:05.680 location is in austin texas mine's in
00:51:08.319 louisville kentucky and
00:51:10.079 we have a system where the communication
00:51:12.880 is good but we've been working to make
00:51:14.800 it better
00:51:15.760 because jordan is rarely here
00:51:18.400 so he um he's doing a lot of the
00:51:20.559 marketing and the calling and the
00:51:21.920 setting up appointments and i'm doing
00:51:23.839 the more physical meetings in person and
00:51:26.880 uh closings and things like that
00:51:29.599 i don't know if that answered your
00:51:30.960 question or not though
00:51:32.720 well i think a lot that was very
00:51:34.559 practical i think a lot of people
00:51:37.040 are more comfortable starting a
00:51:38.240 partnership with someone they know so
00:51:39.760 their first thought is to go to their
00:51:41.200 friend go to a family member go to
00:51:43.440 somebody who they already have a
00:51:44.880 pre-existing relationship with
00:51:47.200 i'm curious
00:51:48.559 if you guys think it worked easier
00:51:50.319 because you knew each other or if maybe
00:51:52.000 you had to be extra intentional because
00:51:54.160 now there's actually a relationship at
00:51:55.839 risk if things go wrong like what were
00:51:58.079 some of the pros and the cons of working
00:51:59.920 with someone that you already know
00:52:02.000 yeah so i'll start um
00:52:05.200 john and i had known each other for a
00:52:06.720 very long time but we hadn't really
00:52:09.920 talked that much for about 10 years
00:52:12.880 until we started
00:52:14.480 we started talking about a year before
00:52:16.319 this he was doing some real estate
00:52:17.839 investing in louisville i was actually
00:52:19.680 also doing some real estate investing in
00:52:21.440 louisville and we floated the idea
00:52:24.000 around
00:52:24.960 but i think both of us are very
00:52:26.400 conservative and cautious people and we
00:52:28.960 wanted to make sure we were on the same
00:52:30.800 page so before we even got into the
00:52:33.440 partnership we set some goals we talked
00:52:36.160 about where we wanted to go and we put
00:52:38.240 this all down in writing we had an
00:52:39.839 attorney put an operating agreement
00:52:41.280 together we both signed it
00:52:43.599 and then we started buying our first
00:52:45.440 houses but
00:52:47.200 yeah we we were both cautious about
00:52:49.359 getting into a partnership because in
00:52:51.119 the past
00:52:52.640 we've only done this on our own
00:52:55.200 i'm curious
00:52:56.800 we've only kind of taken the couple's
00:52:58.319 angle so far but it's actually about
00:53:00.480 setting goals with the people you do
00:53:01.920 life with
00:53:03.040 whether in this case now we're talking
00:53:05.599 into you two as partners as business
00:53:08.640 partners
00:53:10.559 as you look back what were the things
00:53:12.720 that inherently you think partnerships
00:53:14.880 lack
00:53:16.640 that
00:53:17.440 this type of approach or methodology
00:53:20.160 provides so i think a lot of what
00:53:22.720 partnerships lack are people with two
00:53:25.280 different skill sets i see that all the
00:53:27.680 time hey we're both really good at doing
00:53:29.760 this thing
00:53:31.200 let's join together as partners uh you
00:53:34.000 know like john said
00:53:35.760 we know each other very well
00:53:38.079 and that did help me have some insight
00:53:39.839 to know what he's good at he's great at
00:53:42.240 the details i am terrible at the details
00:53:45.359 i'm great at getting the ball rolling
00:53:47.520 and
00:53:48.240 being the big picture type of guy
00:53:50.480 he's awesome at making sure nothing
00:53:52.319 slips through the cracks so that's why
00:53:54.480 this is a great partnership it really
00:53:56.480 doesn't have
00:53:57.599 too much to do that we
00:53:59.280 we knew each other
00:54:00.720 other than we had
00:54:02.960 similar values similar goals we actually
00:54:06.559 john i don't know if you remember we
00:54:07.680 first talked about this when we were in
00:54:09.280 our teens
00:54:10.559 i remember sitting in a yard with him
00:54:12.559 somewhere and saying wouldn't it be cool
00:54:14.160 if we could buy houses someday and other
00:54:16.160 people would pay them off
00:54:17.839 and what do you know
00:54:20.079 15 20 years later we're now doing that
00:54:23.119 yeah it's pretty crazy i think it helped
00:54:25.040 reinforce it too because
00:54:27.040 i myself had been purchasing and had
00:54:29.440 experience in real estate and jordan had
00:54:32.000 been doing real estate for
00:54:34.000 over what
00:54:35.680 five years or so five years so we both
00:54:38.079 had a track record
00:54:40.240 of uh
00:54:42.240 new but at least got our feet wet in
00:54:44.400 real estate before so none of us were
00:54:46.000 brand new agreeing to it which kind of
00:54:48.240 helped reinforce both sides i feel like
00:54:50.240 how long have the two of you been in
00:54:51.280 partnership it's just a year
00:54:53.680 just a year just a year so what are the
00:54:55.680 questions that you have at this point
00:54:57.839 when you think about your partnerships
00:54:59.280 and about how you guys stay on the same
00:55:00.960 page moving forward the big queen we've
00:55:03.680 been talking about this recently the big
00:55:05.839 questions aren't
00:55:07.440 are we going to continue to grow because
00:55:09.200 we know we're going to do that we know
00:55:10.960 we both have the the same goals we want
00:55:14.079 to do these things
00:55:15.440 the biggest questions are how are we
00:55:17.119 going to continue to grow how are we
00:55:18.880 going to bring other people and build
00:55:20.400 this company into a point where it's not
00:55:22.319 just john and i doing most things
00:55:24.880 so
00:55:26.240 those are our big questions is how do we
00:55:28.559 set goals
00:55:29.920 to leverage other people and i think
00:55:31.839 like you're talking about live in the 20
00:55:34.319 and forget about the 80 have other
00:55:36.240 people handle the 80. well if we can
00:55:38.240 only if we're kind of turning the tables
00:55:40.160 now to going to moving forward if we can
00:55:42.720 only invest our time together focusing
00:55:44.799 on one area where would it be building a
00:55:46.960 business or structuring the business
00:55:50.640 specifically around team
00:55:53.680 okay
00:55:55.520 john would you agree with that it is and
00:55:57.680 and that's where it's
00:55:59.200 i would say a struggle not struggle but
00:56:01.280 jordan and i are in different chapters
00:56:03.040 where
00:56:04.240 um i have an insurance office in
00:56:06.079 louisville kentucky a brokerage
00:56:08.400 and then i have
00:56:09.839 jordan and i's partnership
00:56:11.839 and then i have our three young children
00:56:14.559 so it's kind of a juggling act like you
00:56:16.160 were talking about earlier
00:56:17.839 um
00:56:19.040 the more time i take
00:56:21.359 away from our insurance brokerage
00:56:24.319 i've been focusing a good amount of time
00:56:26.720 in our partnership jordan and i so
00:56:29.200 we were talking about this today having
00:56:30.880 a meeting just about juggling that and
00:56:33.520 what percentage to put where you know
00:56:35.119 what i mean
00:56:36.160 perfect um
00:56:39.040 do you guys have a long-term goal for
00:56:40.880 the organization yet in terms of growth
00:56:43.040 we do
00:56:45.359 what is it
00:56:46.400 so we have a one year end of this year a
00:56:48.960 next year and then a five-year goal at
00:56:51.440 the end of this year we want to have 25
00:56:53.440 houses
00:56:54.480 in the next year 50 houses
00:56:57.040 and in five years we want 200 houses
00:56:59.760 fast forward and you have 200 houses
00:57:04.720 are you going to feel satisfied or are
00:57:06.720 you going to look back and think i was i
00:57:08.319 was thinking too small that's a great
00:57:09.839 question
00:57:12.559 i my knee-jerk reaction is i'm always
00:57:15.440 going to look back and think i was
00:57:16.880 thinking too small
00:57:18.960 but i'd love to probably right
00:57:20.880 200 sounds like a big number but
00:57:23.040 jordan and i are pretty uh aggressive
00:57:25.680 goal planners i feel like
00:57:27.520 and we're on pace right now
00:57:29.920 to do 25 our first year of partnership
00:57:32.240 but
00:57:33.040 um let me ask a different question fast
00:57:35.520 forward five years we're having a
00:57:36.960 conversation again and you what you
00:57:39.119 achieved was extraordinary you shattered
00:57:42.079 what you even perceived to be possible
00:57:45.040 what's that number i think john 400
00:57:47.200 houses i would say four or 500 would be
00:57:50.880 a mind blower okay well let's round it
00:57:53.520 up to 500 just because it's fun and it's
00:57:56.319 a round number
00:57:57.920 and there's something to acknowledge the
00:57:59.680 purpose of a goal is not the result
00:58:02.400 it's
00:58:03.599 to be appropriate in the moment
00:58:05.520 that goal is a compass to inform how the
00:58:07.839 two of you have to show up and behave
00:58:10.880 in order to be in alignment with the
00:58:12.640 goal it's less about whether you get to
00:58:14.160 500 or not it's about who's the person
00:58:16.240 you become along the way
00:58:19.119 here's the first step
00:58:21.680 what if if i challenge you to take out a
00:58:23.760 pen and a piece of paper and draw out
00:58:26.160 the org chart that you would need to
00:58:28.079 assemble to have that type of a business
00:58:31.520 what would that org chart look like
00:58:34.640 and this exercise is called the ultimate
00:58:36.400 org chart this is what i learned from
00:58:37.599 gary keller he said don't show me what
00:58:39.359 your org chart looks today or what it
00:58:41.119 needs to look like this year i want you
00:58:43.040 to have a longer term vision for the
00:58:44.720 organization of what does the
00:58:45.760 organization look like when it's built
00:58:47.359 out and it's done go ahead and cast that
00:58:49.839 org chart i've got a ceo i've got a
00:58:52.000 president i've got
00:58:53.520 all these vps i've got all these
00:58:55.200 directors i've got all these managers
00:58:56.799 like i'm walking you through our org
00:58:58.400 chart for what ours looks like in 10
00:59:00.799 years i can actually visualize it
00:59:03.200 and then you ask the question
00:59:06.720 what roles are you jordan currently
00:59:08.720 playing
00:59:09.680 and you put your name next to those
00:59:11.839 john what roles are you currently
00:59:13.440 playing where are you just flat out
00:59:15.119 missing people or the business has not
00:59:17.040 created the demand
00:59:18.480 for that role yet but here's why this
00:59:21.200 matters
00:59:22.559 one that gives you vision
00:59:25.040 in terms of who you're looking for
00:59:26.400 because one of the first things i heard
00:59:27.440 from gary is you're not looking for an
00:59:29.040 executive assistant you're looking for a
00:59:30.960 future ceo
00:59:33.040 who's currently showing up as an ea
00:59:35.520 you're not looking for a marketing
00:59:37.200 manager you're looking for your future
00:59:39.040 cmo who's currently showing up as a
00:59:41.680 marketing manager that way it forces you
00:59:44.319 to stop looking for somebody who checks
00:59:46.640 the box today but instead has the growth
00:59:49.760 opportunity to evolve and grow their
00:59:52.079 skill set as the needs of the business
00:59:54.240 evolve because what the business needs
00:59:56.000 in phase one is very different than
00:59:57.520 phase two very different than phase
00:59:59.200 three very different than phase four and
01:00:01.440 you wanna find empire builders people
01:00:03.760 that can grow with you
01:00:08.000 so you ask the five five hundred units
01:00:10.160 in five years what does that org chart
01:00:12.240 have to look like here's where it gets
01:00:14.559 interesting
01:00:17.040 jordan
01:00:18.079 what do your goals
01:00:20.400 require your role that you occupy
01:00:24.559 to do exceptionally well the two to
01:00:26.799 three things or you should fire yourself
01:00:29.760 john what are the two to three things
01:00:32.319 your goals require your role to do
01:00:36.440 exceptionally well
01:00:39.440 you guys get clarity on what your
01:00:41.280 individual job descriptions are then you
01:00:43.680 can ask the question who's the one
01:00:45.760 person we are missing
01:00:48.559 that if we just brought that one person
01:00:50.480 into our world
01:00:51.760 everything else would be easier
01:00:53.200 unnecessary
01:00:54.720 gary literally said this two days ago he
01:00:56.640 goes one of the big you wanna if you
01:00:58.640 wanna
01:00:59.920 live an extraordinary wealthy life you
01:01:02.799 need to master two things lead
01:01:04.559 generation in this case it might just be
01:01:06.640 deal flow
01:01:08.559 and finding the one person
01:01:11.280 oprah winfrey was not oprah winfrey
01:01:13.280 until she met jeffrey jacobs her
01:01:14.799 attorney the beatles were not beatles
01:01:16.720 until they met george martin walt disney
01:01:18.799 wasn't walt disney tilly brought his
01:01:20.799 brother roy disney
01:01:22.839 in oftentimes you're one person away
01:01:25.839 from unlocking an entirely new level of
01:01:28.640 growth i've gone through this last year
01:01:30.240 i brought i fired myself from running
01:01:32.799 the company brought in a proven
01:01:34.799 executive the company has doubled
01:01:37.599 and i have
01:01:39.200 stayed squarely in my vision growth and
01:01:42.559 ambassador role
01:01:44.160 i'm happier than i've ever been i was
01:01:46.240 missing one person
01:01:48.720 so recap
01:01:50.400 what does the org chart look like when
01:01:52.400 you have 500 houses
01:01:54.960 what are the where are you currently
01:01:56.640 playing roles jordan john where are you
01:01:59.039 currently playing roles who are you know
01:02:00.480 you're immediately missing but then get
01:02:02.480 clarity
01:02:03.680 what are the two to three things your
01:02:04.960 goals require you to do exceptionally
01:02:06.799 well for you to keep your spot and who's
01:02:08.640 the one person you're missing
01:02:11.440 what are their two to three things
01:02:13.920 then you start recruiting
01:02:16.319 you start looking and just go find that
01:02:18.960 one person and make that one higher and
01:02:22.160 then you look up and say who's the next
01:02:23.760 person we're missing
01:02:25.280 and you make that higher who's the next
01:02:27.119 person you're missing or if you did what
01:02:28.559 i did i hired one person to come in and
01:02:32.079 it's the last hire i need to make
01:02:34.000 because he's in charge of hiring
01:02:35.359 everybody else
01:02:37.839 i like that
01:02:38.960 you know i want to ask you guys a
01:02:40.160 question about this as
01:02:42.480 jeff said hey what would a what would it
01:02:44.640 look like if you completely crushed it
01:02:46.000 you said well we'd have 500 homes
01:02:49.200 and i'm not leading you to an answer i'm
01:02:51.280 literally asking do you want to own 500
01:02:53.920 single family homes in louisville we've
01:02:56.079 talked about that so
01:02:58.640 both john and i feel like in the future
01:03:01.280 we need to diversify markets so
01:03:05.760 what that looks like is we're probably
01:03:08.720 no not probably we have started looking
01:03:10.880 in texas we have a team of people out
01:03:13.359 looking for houses in texas for us san
01:03:15.760 antonio austin area
01:03:19.200 we want to own 500 homes but we don't
01:03:22.480 want to do all that work and i know you
01:03:24.640 know david single-family homes can be a
01:03:26.640 lot of work
01:03:27.839 so we want to structure an organization
01:03:30.799 that takes care of all that work do you
01:03:33.039 know how many people you'll need in that
01:03:34.880 organization to successfully manage 500
01:03:37.680 single-family homes
01:03:39.200 we have not gotten that far yet
01:03:41.359 if you did that and you realize that
01:03:43.359 that's an entire company maybe like 10
01:03:45.920 15 20 people that you would need
01:03:48.480 which is now 10 15 20 personalities that
01:03:50.880 have to be managed and people that take
01:03:52.880 resources and energy
01:03:55.760 would you consider
01:03:57.520 changing the trajectory of what you want
01:03:59.119 your company to look like would you
01:04:00.160 maybe get to 100 homes and 1031 into an
01:04:02.400 apartment complex then start buying
01:04:03.920 another 100 oh yeah we've absolutely
01:04:06.240 talked about that too i think
01:04:08.400 we made the decision last year
01:04:11.440 to focus on single-family homes because
01:04:13.599 we're finding great deals with
01:04:15.119 single-family homes we had been looking
01:04:17.599 at apartment complexes and we still do
01:04:19.599 every so often
01:04:20.880 and we just aren't seeing the types of
01:04:23.440 deals we'd like to see
01:04:25.200 okay let me jump in here so
01:04:27.520 remember what i said the purpose of a
01:04:28.880 goal was
01:04:31.039 to be appropriate in the moment it's to
01:04:33.200 inform what you have to focus on how you
01:04:36.960 have to behave
01:04:38.559 if you had a plethora of opportunities
01:04:42.160 great deals in single family but you had
01:04:44.079 equally the same opportunity in
01:04:45.760 apartment which path would you pursue
01:04:48.799 i i'm gonna say apartments but oh okay
01:04:52.160 to johnson
01:04:54.079 john
01:04:54.880 yeah we would we both own um
01:04:58.480 i think we would both agree that we're
01:04:59.920 looking to get into
01:05:02.400 30 plus unit apartments because we both
01:05:04.319 have perfect small we both have smaller
01:05:07.359 eight and under unit apartments
01:05:09.680 individually each so perfect perfect so
01:05:13.599 this is so good
01:05:15.039 a lot of people set their goals
01:05:18.720 based on what they think they can
01:05:21.599 do
01:05:23.520 and what you perceive you can do is
01:05:26.000 based on your current circumstance right
01:05:28.240 now your deal flow is in single family
01:05:30.319 so you set a single family goal
01:05:32.960 that is not the purpose of the goal
01:05:36.079 the goal is to ask
01:05:38.079 what does extraordinary look like
01:05:41.200 and it's hey i'd have x number of doors
01:05:43.599 whether that's a single family home
01:05:45.280 whether it's an apartment complex
01:05:46.799 providing x amount of cash flow or y
01:05:49.280 amount of net worth
01:05:51.680 then you can ask the question how am i
01:05:53.039 going to get there well right now the
01:05:54.559 low the the fastest path to building is
01:05:57.200 single family homes that's where you're
01:05:59.359 finding your deals and you want to scale
01:06:01.119 that you want to you want to acquire
01:06:02.799 more and more and more but ultimately
01:06:05.200 david asked a great question do you
01:06:06.559 actually want a manager have a team that
01:06:08.000 manages 500 homes i'm actually hearing
01:06:09.839 maybe not as much
01:06:12.319 so
01:06:13.520 maybe the whole goal is to get to a
01:06:15.520 hundred so that you can 1031 into your
01:06:18.480 first big building and then you repeat
01:06:20.880 you get your next hundred homes so you
01:06:22.559 can 10 31 and get your next building so
01:06:26.480 the two of you like jordan i know you're
01:06:28.240 coming back for the retreat this year
01:06:30.480 john you're going to be in tow with him
01:06:33.200 the two of you have to actually ask the
01:06:35.440 question
01:06:38.160 what does success look like in five
01:06:40.480 years if it's 500 homes fine but i'd ask
01:06:43.280 the question what does 500 homes do for
01:06:45.280 you
01:06:46.480 and set the goal more around that and
01:06:48.559 detach yourself from the how
01:06:51.280 detach yourself from the 500 attach
01:06:53.920 yourself to what the 500 does from you
01:06:57.039 then you can start reverse engineering
01:06:58.559 because completely other opportunity
01:07:00.480 might open up maybe it's
01:07:02.480 storage
01:07:03.839 ownership maybe you want to go mobile
01:07:05.920 home park who knows
01:07:08.000 but be open to the paths as but it's
01:07:11.039 about how do you be appropriate in the
01:07:12.400 moment what do we need to focus on this
01:07:14.240 year that's going to bring us closer to
01:07:15.839 that longer term vision
01:07:17.760 and youtube being on the same page it's
01:07:19.839 extra important because like what jeff
01:07:21.760 is saying the goal helps you understand
01:07:24.640 who you need to become in order to hit
01:07:26.799 that and if you want to manage 15 to 20
01:07:30.079 people basically have a property
01:07:31.440 management company to help you
01:07:33.760 herd 500 cats which is what it will feel
01:07:36.000 like when you get 500 single-family
01:07:37.599 homes the skills that each of you need
01:07:39.599 to be working on individually to be
01:07:41.359 successful in that are different than if
01:07:43.760 you want to get to 100 10 31 into an
01:07:45.760 apartment start over right you can do
01:07:47.839 that with a smaller organization you'll
01:07:49.599 need more people that are analytical
01:07:51.280 you'll need relationships with brokers
01:07:53.200 you'll just need to become a different
01:07:54.559 kind of human being to be successful
01:07:56.400 in that goal and that's why this is so
01:07:58.640 important that we have these
01:07:59.839 conversations because can you imagine if
01:08:02.160 you said hey i'm taking a journey to
01:08:03.839 that destination and you geared up for
01:08:05.760 everything you would need to go there
01:08:07.520 and a third of the way there you
01:08:08.880 completely changed your mind and said
01:08:10.160 actually we're going to go there now you
01:08:12.160 have to stop and reprovision and re and
01:08:14.799 ask yourself do i have the skills that i
01:08:16.238 would need to be good there and maybe
01:08:17.439 set yourself behind whereas if you sort
01:08:19.920 of plan this ahead of time look we're
01:08:21.359 going to get to 100 and then we're going
01:08:22.479 to stop and reevaluate we're gonna
01:08:24.000 figure out where do we wanna go
01:08:26.399 it's pretty you can put a plan into
01:08:27.839 place to get you there much easier than
01:08:29.759 we're just gonna go and as balls out 500
01:08:32.560 homes that's as far as we're going to
01:08:33.839 get to and that's our only path and this
01:08:36.399 is why goal setting is so important it
01:08:38.880 also i think brings you the clarity of
01:08:41.279 this is what we want to do it makes your
01:08:42.799 kpis your key performance indicators
01:08:44.640 that much more clear what you want to do
01:08:46.719 it helps you understand where you want
01:08:48.158 to be building relationships right where
01:08:50.238 the deals are going to flow from you're
01:08:51.920 going to need a whole lot more handy
01:08:53.279 many contractors doing single family
01:08:55.040 homes than if you go after an apartment
01:08:56.640 complex so this can make you
01:08:59.439 very successful and like much more
01:09:01.279 successful if you didn't do it and i
01:09:03.198 think what makes it difficult to do is
01:09:04.960 that you're forced to plan for five
01:09:07.040 years down the road and it's always
01:09:08.880 easier to just say what can i do right
01:09:11.198 now that will make me feel better get me
01:09:12.960 out of the pain that i'm in right now
01:09:14.799 i'm curious what it what have you two
01:09:16.399 learned having this conversation oh i
01:09:18.799 thought was about to say you know i love
01:09:20.479 going we're going to goal-setting
01:09:21.920 retreats going to conferences and
01:09:24.000 getting different perspectives because
01:09:25.759 if john and i all we did was just talk
01:09:28.238 in between each other all the time
01:09:30.640 we might stick to hey we just want to
01:09:32.799 hit 500 homes in five years we're never
01:09:35.439 going to look anywhere else but just as
01:09:37.279 many houses as we can get and maybe in
01:09:40.080 five years when we're managing 500 homes
01:09:42.640 we're really burnt out and we hate it
01:09:44.799 and we don't like it and that's a lot of
01:09:47.120 what we were talking about earlier today
01:09:48.960 i'm like john how can we get you to not
01:09:51.120 drive around the city all day you have a
01:09:53.759 thriving insurance brokerage you've got
01:09:55.760 three kids and a wife you've got other
01:09:57.920 stuff you'd like to do rather than drive
01:09:59.760 around check on job sites so i love this
01:10:03.280 kind of stuff
01:10:04.560 always i would
01:10:06.400 i know i said a lot of steps for you
01:10:08.480 guys but i'm going to narrow it down to
01:10:10.239 one how on brand
01:10:13.920 fast forward five years
01:10:17.120 how would you know if you were
01:10:19.360 successful
01:10:22.000 and it's not just number of units or
01:10:24.000 amount of cash flow but i want you to
01:10:25.600 describe lifestyle
01:10:28.560 like you just punch john does not want
01:10:30.400 to be driving all around the city and
01:10:31.920 not being with his kids and his wife
01:10:33.440 that's pretty clear to me now
01:10:35.760 the two of you need to do that
01:10:37.280 individually
01:10:39.120 and then share your answers and cast a a
01:10:42.159 unified vision for the future
01:10:45.040 that will then when you go through the
01:10:46.800 framework again this year
01:10:48.719 will bring a lot of focus to what you
01:10:51.040 need to
01:10:52.640 focus on in the next 12 months
01:10:55.679 which will bring immense clarity to what
01:10:57.199 you have to do in the next 30 days which
01:10:59.199 will inform what your calendar needs to
01:11:00.880 look like this next week
01:11:02.640 well guys this has been
01:11:04.560 great jordan john i want to thank you
01:11:06.480 two for coming on here and sharing what
01:11:08.000 your experience has been like with our
01:11:10.000 listeners as well as a transparency that
01:11:11.840 takes jeff obviously thank you very much
01:11:14.719 for coming and doing what you do the one
01:11:17.840 thing
01:11:18.880 this has been really great maybe is
01:11:20.320 there anything you want to add before we
01:11:21.679 start the process of getting out of here
01:11:23.520 i really
01:11:25.679 appreciate the the working backwards
01:11:28.480 method that jeff describes i think a lot
01:11:31.120 of people don't think that way i think
01:11:33.120 that
01:11:33.920 this is a completely different way to
01:11:35.760 frame it but when you explain it jeff it
01:11:38.000 really makes
01:11:39.199 way more sense because
01:11:41.440 what did you say what does the goal do
01:11:43.600 for you what is your goal and what does
01:11:45.280 that do for you that forces you to think
01:11:47.440 backwards
01:11:48.800 for
01:11:49.520 where you need to be now and and uh like
01:11:52.000 david said when you're working on
01:11:53.199 something like oh let me pivot well you
01:11:55.280 just wasted some time wasted isn't the
01:11:57.440 right word but you didn't spend your
01:11:59.040 time appropriately
01:12:00.640 because you weren't working towards the
01:12:02.080 right goal so this has been eye-opening
01:12:04.640 for me and
01:12:06.560 i'm excited for your
01:12:09.120 for your event it seems like this is
01:12:11.440 going to i'm excited for what jordan is
01:12:13.040 going to get out of it and what john is
01:12:14.480 going to get out of it i think it's
01:12:15.679 going to be a really fantastic
01:12:18.400 uh boost to their company and i can't
01:12:20.640 wait to talk to john and jordan in
01:12:22.159 another year and see
01:12:24.000 what has happened from this retreat and
01:12:26.719 i'll just say um
01:12:28.880 this changed my life
01:12:30.400 i haven't said a single thing here today
01:12:32.000 that i have not lived myself
01:12:34.640 a year ago
01:12:36.560 we were residents of austin texas
01:12:39.199 but my wife and i did our goal-setting
01:12:40.960 retreat
01:12:42.000 and we had an honest conversation
01:12:43.840 realizing we are not texans
01:12:46.080 sorry jordan
01:12:48.560 deep down we wanted to be closer to
01:12:50.000 mountains and i told myself the story
01:12:52.000 that i have to be in austin because it's
01:12:53.520 where the company is it's where gary and
01:12:54.960 jay are
01:12:56.800 but all of a sudden all our corporate
01:12:58.560 clients are saying the future of work is
01:12:59.920 going to be more virtually based
01:13:01.040 physically enhanced and i sat down with
01:13:02.239 my partners and said you know as a
01:13:03.360 company that trains companies to be
01:13:04.719 productive
01:13:05.840 if that's the future of work shouldn't
01:13:07.120 we be one of those companies so we have
01:13:08.480 authority
01:13:09.520 and they said yeah we probably should
01:13:11.600 and so i said so we're taking the
01:13:12.719 company virtual they said yes and my
01:13:15.040 wife and i had already booked a trip to
01:13:16.719 denver because we made our one annual
01:13:18.640 goal if every year for the next five
01:13:20.960 years we took one trip to a place we
01:13:23.360 might want to maybe call home in five
01:13:26.159 years we'll know where we'll want to
01:13:27.440 live so in 10 years we can live where we
01:13:29.040 want to live
01:13:30.880 i bought a house in denver on that trip
01:13:33.360 because we did this retreat
01:13:35.920 so
01:13:36.719 for you who's listening to this
01:13:38.960 what stops us from reinventing ourselves
01:13:40.800 is an attachment to the way things used
01:13:42.159 to be
01:13:43.440 you've learned that in the last year but
01:13:45.040 now is a time to have an honest
01:13:46.480 conversation about where you've been
01:13:47.840 letting life happen to you and where you
01:13:50.320 can be more purposeful so you live a
01:13:52.080 life by design that is the purpose of
01:13:54.320 this
01:13:55.199 so if you want to learn more about the
01:13:56.239 event you can go to biggerpockets.com1
01:13:58.800 that's o n e
01:14:01.000 biggerpockets.com1 they've partnered
01:14:02.719 with us again this year and
01:14:04.480 we can't wait to be with you guys well
01:14:06.159 thank you everybody really appreciate
01:14:07.760 everyone being here the wisdom that's
01:14:09.199 been shared if anyone listening to this
01:14:12.159 is considering it i would highly
01:14:13.760 encourage you to go check it out get
01:14:15.520 around other people that are on the same
01:14:17.120 wavelength and just kind of it seems
01:14:19.199 scary when you just hear other people
01:14:20.480 talking about it but the best way to get
01:14:22.159 good at anything is to immerse yourself
01:14:23.679 in it so go there and watch how other
01:14:25.199 people
01:14:26.080 set their goals i get a lot of clarity
01:14:28.239 out
01:14:28.960 after listening to other people share
01:14:30.880 what they have going on i think minnie's
01:14:32.320 the same way i've almost seen light
01:14:33.520 bulbs popping off on her head as we go
01:14:36.320 as she hears clarity that somebody else
01:14:38.239 got it really does become a community
01:14:40.480 where everyone helps everyone else which
01:14:42.000 is what bigger pockets ultimately is as
01:14:44.239 a bunch of us trying to help each other
01:14:46.239 to be able to build wealth and build the
01:14:47.679 life that we really want so heartfelt
01:14:49.760 thanks to all of you that are here today
01:14:51.679 i'm going to get us out of here this is
01:14:53.760 david green for mindy jensen and jeff
01:14:56.320 the one thing woods
01:14:58.000 signing off
