# https://www.youtube.com/watch/iL_0HblXMho

00:00:00.000 I don't believe you can fundamentally
00:00:01.979 say that Innovation that you want as a
00:00:05.160 CEO to nurture the spirit of innovation
00:00:07.740 to encourage innovation
00:00:10.679 unless
00:00:12.059 you have a culture of risk taking if you
00:00:16.139 want to be successful I would encourage
00:00:18.240 you
00:00:19.020 to grow a tolerance for failure
00:00:21.180 [Music]
00:00:28.980 for over two decades Nvidia has been at
00:00:31.260 the Forefront of innovation in computer
00:00:32.880 graphics and AI technology but it hasn't
00:00:35.760 always been an easy Journey Jensen Huang
00:00:38.100 the founder and CEO of Nvidia immigrated
00:00:40.559 to the U.S from Taiwan as a kid with a
00:00:42.780 dream of enabling PCS with 3D graphics
00:00:45.899 he co-founded Nvidia out of a condo in
00:00:48.300 California and his Ambitions and
00:00:50.340 preference for impossible seeming
00:00:51.840 Ventures have pushed the company to the
00:00:53.460 brink of bankruptcy a handful of times
00:00:55.800 every company makes mistakes and I make
00:00:58.739 a lot of them and you know some of them
00:01:01.260 some of them puts the company in Peril
00:01:04.199 especially in the beginning
00:01:06.240 because we were small and and we're up
00:01:08.700 against very very large companies and
00:01:10.799 we're trying to invent this brand new
00:01:12.240 technology for 10 years Wall Street
00:01:14.400 asked Nvidia why are you making this
00:01:16.500 investment no one's using it and they
00:01:18.720 valued it at zero dollars in our market
00:01:20.460 cap said Brian Catanzaro vice president
00:01:23.340 of Applied deep learning research at
00:01:25.140 Nvidia he was one of the only employees
00:01:27.540 working on AI when he joined Nvidia in
00:01:30.060 2008 but through it all Jensen Huang
00:01:33.060 believed in his vision
00:01:34.619 you saw early on about a decade or so
00:01:36.720 ago that AI could change everything
00:01:39.360 and he changed the company from the
00:01:40.920 bottom all the way to the top and
00:01:42.600 sideways
00:01:43.680 every chip that Nvidia made was focused
00:01:45.780 on artificial intelligence
00:01:47.700 we had the good wisdom to go put the
00:01:50.820 whole company behind it we saw early on
00:01:53.520 about a decade or so ago that this way
00:01:56.939 of doing software could change
00:01:58.320 everything and we changed the company
00:01:59.939 from the bottom all the way to the top
00:02:01.500 and sideways
00:02:02.880 every chip that we made was focused on
00:02:05.520 artificial intelligence for us to take
00:02:07.560 computer graphics and video games to the
00:02:09.780 next level we had to reinvent and
00:02:11.700 disrupt ourselves
00:02:13.280 today Nvidia is among the world's 10
00:02:16.560 most valuable tech companies with a
00:02:18.720 market cap of close to 600 million
00:02:20.640 dollars it Powers the boom and AI
00:02:22.800 technology and is the engine behind
00:02:24.900 large language models like chat GPT and
00:02:28.140 it all started with one man's vision and
00:02:30.180 belief in the power of technology to
00:02:32.400 transform the world seeing an earlier
00:02:34.860 exchange between Huang and Stanford
00:02:36.660 students would help us to understand the
00:02:38.520 key to nvidia's success that Huang
00:02:40.260 provided the company
00:02:41.879 at the core of our company's success is
00:02:46.680 innovation
00:02:47.879 now a lot of companies say Innovation is
00:02:50.580 important to their company
00:02:53.280 invention is important to their company
00:02:56.239 however
00:02:58.040 I don't believe you can fundamentally
00:03:00.540 say
00:03:01.500 The Innovation that you want as a CEO to
00:03:04.920 nurture the spirit of innovation to
00:03:07.379 encourage innovation
00:03:09.300 unless you have a culture of risk taking
00:03:16.860 we have to encourage our our engineers
00:03:20.640 excuse me our marketing people
00:03:23.760 all of our employees to take calculated
00:03:26.640 risks in order to
00:03:29.040 encourage them to take calculated risks
00:03:31.260 first of all you have to teach them how
00:03:33.060 to do that that's a skill a matter of
00:03:35.340 skill then the second part of it is a
00:03:37.440 matter of Courage
00:03:39.739 most people hate to fail
00:03:43.200 are you guys do you guys agree with that
00:03:47.159 but unless you guys want to be
00:03:49.500 successful
00:03:51.659 let me say it the positive way if you
00:03:54.659 want to be successful I would encourage
00:03:56.760 you to grow a tolerance for failure I
00:04:01.440 to develop a tolerance for failure now
00:04:04.019 what I mean a tolerance for failure I
00:04:05.819 don't mean G what Jensen just told me is
00:04:08.280 sleep in until noon okay don't do any of
00:04:12.659 my homework flunk out of all my classes
00:04:15.000 because that defines failure right
00:04:17.880 that's not what I said
00:04:19.738 what I said is what I'm trying to say is
00:04:22.560 that I want you to try things even
00:04:25.620 though it is impossible to calculate
00:04:28.500 precisely that it would lead to success
00:04:30.840 that your instincts your intuition is
00:04:33.600 something you ought to follow if it
00:04:35.580 wasn't because of following my own
00:04:38.160 instincts or the founders instincts or
00:04:40.440 many of our employees instincts why
00:04:42.240 would we be where we are today and what
00:04:43.979 would we have invented things that the
00:04:46.020 Market's never had before the world's
00:04:47.580 never had before so you have to have
00:04:49.500 this this culture where tolerance for
00:04:52.860 risk taking
00:04:54.060 but the thing about failure is this
00:04:56.580 if you fail often
00:04:58.500 enough
00:05:01.020 you actually might become a failure
00:05:03.419 and that's different than being
00:05:04.800 successful
00:05:06.600 and so the question is how do you teach
00:05:09.780 someone
00:05:11.880 how to fail but fail quickly
00:05:16.680 and to change courses as soon as you
00:05:18.840 know it's a dead end
00:05:20.639 and the way to do that is we call it
00:05:23.280 intellectual honesty
00:05:26.180 we assess on a per on a continuous basis
00:05:30.419 whether something makes sense or not and
00:05:32.639 if it's the wrong decision let's change
00:05:34.500 our mind
00:05:35.880 and you know a lot of people say CEOs
00:05:38.759 are always right and they never change
00:05:40.740 their mind
00:05:42.240 that doesn't make any sense at all to me
00:05:44.280 especially when it violates the first
00:05:46.440 principles of what we want the company
00:05:48.660 to become an Innovative company that
00:05:51.720 invents amazing things that solves
00:05:53.699 problems for the world that it sometimes
00:05:56.039 didn't even know it had
00:05:59.460 if you want to do that then you have to
00:06:02.520 cultivate that tolerance for risk taking
00:06:05.759 and you have to then teach people how to
00:06:08.400 fail but fail quickly and inexpensively
00:06:11.240 and how to be direct with each other
00:06:14.000 that that this is the wrong approach and
00:06:16.680 what's the better approach and then you
00:06:18.479 know be flexible enough to change
00:06:19.680 courses and quick and so that that type
00:06:22.979 of culture if you will
00:06:25.199 um in today's you know if you guys
00:06:28.199 weren't to start a company and you were
00:06:29.639 built building a website with an
00:06:31.800 internet service of some kind internet
00:06:33.120 based service of some kind with the
00:06:35.400 competition coming from all over the
00:06:36.840 world
00:06:37.979 and it's 24 7.
00:06:40.199 and ideas take no time to experiment and
00:06:44.400 it you know a particular website or
00:06:46.259 particular company could be throwing
00:06:48.419 ideas out into the world
00:06:50.340 20 a day
00:06:52.979 and so unless you
00:06:55.680 are thoughtful about risk taking and
00:06:58.919 being able to change your mind reacting
00:07:00.539 to the market conditions and being
00:07:02.759 flexible how are you going to stay alive
00:07:04.979 and so you could you could almost see
00:07:06.660 what I just described in the nature of
00:07:09.720 older companies
00:07:11.280 and the nature of the newer companies
00:07:14.340 the modern companies if you guys you
00:07:17.340 guys I'm sure you guys all go to
00:07:18.660 Google's website
00:07:20.039 almost every single applications and
00:07:22.740 beta form
00:07:24.360 they're trying all kinds of stuff right
00:07:26.340 they're trying all kinds of stuff if
00:07:28.380 they call it production and it doesn't
00:07:30.300 work well you guys would just be upset
00:07:31.740 at them so they call it beta
00:07:35.220 have you noticed they call it beta so
00:07:37.319 that they could try a lot of things and
00:07:39.000 if it fails take it out if it's bad take
00:07:41.580 it out if it works do more and so
00:07:43.800 Innovation requires a little bit of
00:07:45.780 experimentation experimentation requires
00:07:48.180 exploration exploration will result in
00:07:50.400 Failure unless you have a tolerance for
00:07:52.800 failure you would never experiment and
00:07:54.360 if you don't ever experiment you would
00:07:55.500 never innovate if you don't innovate you
00:07:57.060 don't succeed
00:07:58.500 you'll just be a dweeb
00:08:01.620 so whether you're an entrepreneur
00:08:03.539 starting your own company or simply
00:08:05.759 trying to make a difference in your
00:08:07.199 field remember the power of believing in
00:08:09.840 your vision with dedication hard work
00:08:12.780 and a willingness to take risks you too
00:08:15.960 can achieve great things
