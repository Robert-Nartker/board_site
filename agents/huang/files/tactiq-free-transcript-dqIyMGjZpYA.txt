# https://www.youtube.com/watch/dqIyMGjZpYA

00:00:00.320 it is the most extraordinary thing bill
00:00:03.120 that a
00:00:04.640 normal dishwasher bus boy could grow up
00:00:07.120 to be this there's no magic it's just 61
00:00:11.559 years of hard work every single day I
00:00:15.160 don't think there's anything more than
00:00:18.600 that do something that the world's never
00:00:20.720 done before let's hope that it's
00:00:22.800 insanely hard to do um the reason why
00:00:25.199 you choose something insanely hard to do
00:00:26.800 by the way so that you have lots of time
00:00:28.199 to go learn it if something is insanely
00:00:30.800 easy to do like Tic Tac
00:00:33.879 D I wouldn't you know fuss over it and
00:00:37.480 the reason for that obviously is highly
00:00:39.239 competitive and so you got to choose
00:00:41.079 something that's incredibly hard to do
00:00:43.160 and that that thing that's hard to do
00:00:45.520 discourages a whole bunch of other all
00:00:47.280 by itself because the person who's
00:00:48.960 willing to to to suffer the longest wins
00:00:52.920 and so we choose things that are
00:00:54.120 incredibly hard to do and you've heard
00:00:55.800 me say pain and suffering a lot and and
00:00:58.359 it's actually a positive attribute
00:01:01.120 people who can suffer are the ultimately
00:01:04.040 the ones that are the most successful
00:01:05.960 number one number two you should choose
00:01:07.960 something that somehow you're destined
00:01:09.680 to do either a set of qualities about
00:01:13.000 your personality or your expertise or
00:01:15.320 the people you're surrounded by your
00:01:16.960 scale your whatever your perspective
00:01:18.759 whatever you're somehow destined to do
00:01:20.560 and then number three you better you
00:01:22.520 better love working on that thing so
00:01:24.280 much because unless so the pain and
00:01:26.920 suffering is too great so the thing is
00:01:29.600 when you're you want to build something
00:01:31.280 something
00:01:32.520 great uh it's not easy to do and when
00:01:36.040 you're doing something that's not easy
00:01:37.280 to do you're not always enjoying it I
00:01:40.640 don't love every day of my job I don't
00:01:43.560 think every day brings me joy nor does
00:01:46.200 Joy have to be the definition of a good
00:01:48.680 day and every day I'm not happy every
00:01:51.479 year I'm not happy about the company um
00:01:53.880 but I love the company every single
00:01:56.920 second and so I think that that what
00:01:59.560 people misunderstand is is somehow the
00:02:03.119 best jobs are the one that brings you
00:02:04.759 happiness all the time I I don't think
00:02:06.680 that that's right you have to you have
00:02:09.360 to you have to suffer you have to
00:02:12.440 struggle you have to Endeavor you have
00:02:15.440 to do those hard things and work through
00:02:17.920 it in order to really appreciate what
00:02:20.640 you've done and there are no such thing
00:02:23.800 that are great that was easy to do and
00:02:26.640 so by Def by definition I would I would
00:02:28.959 say therefore
00:02:30.440 um I I I wish upon you greatness which
00:02:34.680 by my way of saying it I wish upon you
00:02:36.519 plenty of plain and suffering and
00:02:38.800 so one one of my one of I think one of
00:02:42.560 my great advantages is that I have very
00:02:44.640 low expectations and and I mean that
00:02:47.840 most of the Stanford graduates have very
00:02:50.480 high
00:02:51.560 expectations you you and you deserve to
00:02:53.760 have have expectations because you came
00:02:55.560 from a great school you were very
00:02:57.840 successful you're at top of your class
00:03:00.519 obviously you were able to pay for
00:03:01.959 tuition and and then you're graduating
00:03:04.200 from one of the finest institutions on
00:03:05.680 the planet you're surrounded by other
00:03:07.840 kids that are just
00:03:09.360 incredible you should have very you
00:03:11.480 naturally have very high expectations
00:03:13.840 people with very high expectations have
00:03:15.440 very low
00:03:16.990 [Music]
00:03:20.680 resilience and unfortunately resilience
00:03:23.959 matters in
00:03:26.560 success I don't know how to teach it to
00:03:28.519 you except for I hope suff happens to
00:03:30.400 you and I was fortunate that I grew up
00:03:33.400 with a with with my parents providing a
00:03:36.760 condition for us to be successful on the
00:03:38.599 one hand but there were plenty of
00:03:40.760 opportunities for setbacks and suffering
00:03:42.720 and and to to this day I Ed the word the
00:03:45.159 phrase pain and suffering inside our
00:03:47.000 company with great Glee and the reason
00:03:49.280 and I mean that boy this is going to
00:03:51.480 cause a lot of pain and suffering and I
00:03:53.040 mean that in a happy way because you
00:03:54.599 want to train you want to refine the
00:03:56.360 character of your company you want the
00:03:58.640 you want greatness out of them and
00:04:00.640 greatness is not intelligence greatness
00:04:02.480 comes from character and character isn't
00:04:04.319 formed out of smart people it's formed
00:04:06.159 out of people who suffered and so that's
00:04:08.879 the and so if I could wish upon you I
00:04:11.040 don't know how to do it for all of you
00:04:13.519 Stanford students I I wish upon you
00:04:16.600 ample doses of pain and suffering Nvidia
00:04:19.759 started as a small startup with Big
00:04:22.440 Dreams under Jensen hang's leadership
00:04:25.960 the company pioneered the graphics
00:04:27.960 Processing Unit GP
00:04:30.240 EU revolutionizing the gaming and
00:04:33.120 computer Graphics
00:04:34.960 Industries with a passion for pushing
00:04:37.560 boundaries and a Keen Eye for Innovation
00:04:41.000 Wang propelled Invidia to new heights
00:04:44.080 cementing its place as a tech Powerhouse
00:04:48.000 of course no success story is without
00:04:50.840 its
00:04:51.680 challenges throughout his career hang
00:04:54.600 faced numerous setbacks and obstacles
00:04:57.600 from Fierce competition to econom IC
00:05:00.720 downturns but true to his resilient
00:05:03.720 nature he never allowed these hurdles to
00:05:06.400 deter him instead he used them as fuel
00:05:10.360 to drive him forward and Propel Nvidia
00:05:13.360 to even greater
00:05:14.919 success today Nvidia stands as one of
00:05:18.440 the most valuable tech companies in the
00:05:20.840 world with its gpus powering everything
00:05:25.160 from gaming consoles to self-driving
00:05:28.199 cars
00:05:29.880 under hang's Guidance the company
00:05:32.840 continues to push the boundaries of
00:05:35.080 what's possible in the world of
00:05:37.520 technology pioneering advancements in
00:05:40.440 artificial intelligence deep learning
00:05:43.360 and more Jensen hang's journey is a
00:05:47.240 testament to the power of vision
00:05:49.880 resilience and Relentless
00:05:52.520 Innovation his story shows us that with
00:05:55.680 the right mindset we can overcome any
00:05:58.520 obstacle and achieve extraordinary
00:06:01.240 success I was always rambunctious I was
00:06:03.759 always setting stuff on fire and gluing
00:06:05.880 stuff together and blowing things up and
00:06:08.759 you know digging holes in this and
00:06:10.400 building that and whatnot so so I was a
00:06:12.720 rambunctious kid but but um I always
00:06:15.080 cared deeply about grades and I always
00:06:17.319 knew that I wanted to do something in
00:06:19.080 mathematics and for somebody who who um
00:06:22.280 who has an analytical mind uh who likes
00:06:25.280 to build things uh who likes to uh make
00:06:29.800 things the world's never seen uh being
00:06:31.919 an engineer is the is the perfect
00:06:34.199 perfect uh perfect career you know what
00:06:36.560 engineering really is is um
00:06:39.680 understanding
00:06:40.680 problems um having tools that helps you
00:06:44.280 analyze problems and break the problems
00:06:47.560 down into smaller pieces so that you can
00:06:49.599 find
00:06:51.080 sound um mathematically sound or
00:06:54.360 scientifically sound um solutions for
00:06:58.120 those problems uh most of life is really
00:07:01.080 about smart problem solving and I I
00:07:03.319 found that that um uh my engineering
00:07:07.560 skills in problem solving and my
00:07:11.280 education and first principle of
00:07:13.680 knowledge um has really helped in in um
00:07:17.080 almost everything that I do including
00:07:18.919 being the CEO so what's it like to be an
00:07:22.319 engineer at Nvidia what projects do you
00:07:24.879 work on what do you do every day one of
00:07:27.840 the things that's really cool about our
00:07:29.240 company
00:07:30.199 is that you're surrounded with people
00:07:31.759 who are genuinely passionate about doing
00:07:34.520 the same thing that you're trying to do
00:07:36.199 in the same field uh let's do something
00:07:38.840 that matters something that we're good
00:07:40.720 at and something that brings us joy okay
00:07:43.440 and so um what I've just described is
00:07:46.000 really the first principles of strategic
00:07:48.560 thinking and um uh it's how we decide
00:07:51.680 what to work on and of course if it
00:07:54.680 followed and satisfied the rules that I
00:07:57.400 just provided uh it must be pretty cool
00:08:00.199 and smart thinking about a problem is
00:08:02.360 really at the beginning of engineering
00:08:04.400 it's asking the question what is this
00:08:06.400 problem really about now there are some
00:08:09.000 problems that if you try to solve it in
00:08:10.680 the most literal sense it would take a
00:08:12.680 long time to solve it might take a lot
00:08:15.039 of money to solve uh it might take an
00:08:17.440 enormous amount of cost you know in time
00:08:20.159 or resource or whatever it is or
00:08:22.520 materials um but if you change the
00:08:24.599 problem and you you truly understand
00:08:26.919 what is it what is the person really
00:08:28.520 trying to ask
00:08:30.479 you know what is what is at the core of
00:08:32.479 that problem may you maybe you can
00:08:34.519 express that problem in a slightly
00:08:35.958 different way and as a result it become
00:08:38.640 solvable and a solution can be found
00:08:41.799 maybe you can maybe you can break the
00:08:43.240 problem down into 10 pieces and that you
00:08:45.720 would solve it over time that it almost
00:08:47.839 doesn't matter um what the end
00:08:51.240 profession is I think the most important
00:08:53.880 thing about engineering is that you're
00:08:55.920 learning life skills about asking the
00:08:59.120 right question questions and breaking
00:09:00.920 down problems and finding solutions to
00:09:03.120 it that are that are elegant and optimal
00:09:06.519 and uh and have the life skills to
00:09:09.519 continuously improve and you know all of
00:09:12.399 those skills are are really all that
00:09:14.279 engineering teaches us along with of
00:09:16.959 course a lot of first principle
00:09:19.120 knowledge that that is you know that is
00:09:22.320 that is when applied um helps us find
00:09:24.920 more elegant Solutions and so uh that's
00:09:27.839 that's really all engineering is about
00:09:30.279 and so problem solving is life you know
00:09:33.360 problem solving is life and and um what
00:09:37.079 what what could be better preparation
00:09:38.680 for life than to have the world's best
00:09:42.000 skills for problem solving work is the
00:09:44.839 rest of your life ouch exactly so my
00:09:49.880 first wish is for you to find joy in
00:09:52.640 work find work that gives you great Joy
00:09:55.560 or just fall in love with whatever work
00:09:57.200 you do that's the only way you're going
00:09:59.680 to do your best work that's the only way
00:10:01.920 you're going to do Exquisite
00:10:04.480 work instead of working for a living
00:10:07.760 think of it as your life's
00:10:10.480 work I wish for you to love your work as
00:10:12.800 much as I've loved my work Lori my kids
00:10:16.320 my family the nearly 6,000 employees at
00:10:19.040 Nvidia and everybody i' I've ever worked
00:10:21.680 with in the computer industry knows I
00:10:24.040 love my
00:10:26.040 work Nvidia is my life's work when one
00:10:29.440 that I'm passionate about and one that
00:10:31.160 I'm giving my very best to make as great
00:10:33.160 as possible so my first wish to you is
00:10:36.760 the same that I wish you find joy in
00:10:39.399 your work my second wish for you is to
00:10:42.120 learn to embrace
00:10:44.519 failure I've just said two contrarian
00:10:47.200 words work and
00:10:49.360 failure we've been taught all of our
00:10:51.600 Lives to not be a
00:10:55.519 failure so why am I standing here
00:10:58.079 wishing you embrace
00:11:00.040 failing avoiding failure is not the same
00:11:02.680 as achieving success in fact finding
00:11:05.600 failure is a discovery of
00:11:08.360 sorts it's a discovery of yet another
00:11:10.800 way how not to do
00:11:13.600 something failures often on the path to
00:11:16.320 success it was for
00:11:17.839 NVIDIA Nvidia failed failed from the
00:11:20.800 very
00:11:22.000 beginning we found Fame early on as a
00:11:24.920 failed
00:11:26.279 startup that was surely to go out of
00:11:28.399 business
00:11:30.160 you know every high-tech
00:11:31.760 startup has a fundamental technology
00:11:34.560 that they thought they
00:11:37.000 discovered and the fundamental
00:11:38.760 technology we founded the company on was
00:11:40.560 a rendering technology called forward
00:11:43.200 texture mapping it doesn't matter what
00:11:44.959 it stands for it doesn't matter what it
00:11:47.000 means there are tens of 3D there were
00:11:49.800 tens of 3D Graphics companies huge
00:11:52.320 established ones like Silicon Graphics
00:11:55.279 to well-funded startups like 3dfx and we
00:11:58.519 were the only company to use this
00:12:00.760 approach we did it for logical reasons
00:12:03.920 we believed in what we
00:12:05.760 believe well our approach was
00:12:09.000 flawed inverse which is the exact
00:12:12.040 opposite rather than forward was the
00:12:14.360 better solution we were just
00:12:17.480 wrong after 2 million uh 2 years and
00:12:20.360 millions of dollars later we had to
00:12:22.160 change our course we
00:12:24.320 failed now how could anything good come
00:12:26.760 from being completely wrong from being a
00:12:29.800 complete failure well it turns out
00:12:32.639 because we were so
00:12:34.000 different and didn't work with standards
00:12:36.800 we had to evangelize our unique
00:12:39.480 architecture directly to software
00:12:41.920 developers and game developers and in
00:12:44.480 working with the game creators we
00:12:46.839 adopted their
00:12:49.120 sensibility the te that technology
00:12:51.639 matters but it's really about fun and
00:12:54.839 beautiful imageries we learned that we
00:12:57.720 were not just a chip or a technology
00:13:01.399 company NVIDIA was really a company at
00:13:03.920 the intersection of technology and
00:13:06.240 art so even after we changed course and
00:13:09.000 became the world's last among many 3D
00:13:13.279 companies all using inverse texture
00:13:15.800 mapping we retain that sensibility that
00:13:18.199 games is an art
00:13:20.240 form and that we need to create
00:13:22.240 technologies that allowed the game game
00:13:24.760 developers to artistically Express their
00:13:26.920 imagination and that purpose wasn't just
00:13:29.680 to build a chip but to create an
00:13:31.560 experience that was magical and
00:13:33.880 delightful this perspective led to
00:13:36.120 fundamental differences in how we
00:13:37.920 approached our work and led to many
00:13:40.480 inventions that changed the computer
00:13:42.680 industry
00:13:44.399 altogether today Nvidia is the largest
00:13:46.959 and the only dedicated visual Computing
00:13:49.079 company in the world the most successful
00:13:50.839 computer Graphics Company in history and
00:13:53.519 that sensibility permeates our company
00:13:55.560 to this day it all started because we
00:13:57.959 chose the wrong
00:14:00.279 technology because we
00:14:02.720 failed so my second wish to you is
00:14:05.399 Embrace
00:14:06.920 failure my last Last Wish to you is to
00:14:09.639 see the world like a
00:14:11.399 child you know certainly after all this
00:14:13.639 education we've been told to grow up to
00:14:15.920 grow up uh I'm giving you yet another
00:14:18.600 contrarian advice another wish to see
00:14:22.600 the world like a child to see the world
00:14:25.079 without preconceived notions and
00:14:27.480 Prejudice the world is complex you're
00:14:29.920 going to go into a complicated World
00:14:32.320 sometimes rather cynical we are
00:14:34.600 surrounded by conventional wisdom
00:14:36.720 dictating that what works and what
00:14:39.320 doesn't it is true most ideas simply
00:14:43.519 won't
00:14:44.480 work we created one that didn't if you
